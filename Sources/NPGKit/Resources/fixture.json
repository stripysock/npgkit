                            "L Gordon Darling AC CMG (1921-2015), the Founding Patron of the National Portrait Gallery, was born in London and schooled in England before serving as a major in the AIF during World War II. In the early 1950s he became a company director with BHP, a position he held for thirty-two years. For fifteen years during this period he was also Chairman of Rheem Australia and Koitaki Ltd. His interest in the visual arts led him to accept the position of inaugural Chairman of the Board of the Australian National Gallery from 1982 to 1986. At the end of this period he established The Gordon Darling Australian Print Fund, which has acquired more than 6000 prints for the national collection to date. In 1991 he established the Gordon Darling Foundation, which provides funding and staff development opportunities for public art institutions Australia-wide. That year, too, he and his wife, Marilyn, initiated and facilitated the touring exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery. The interest generated by the exhibition led to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery. Amongst the very earliest acquisitions of the Gallery were gifts from Darling, who accepted the inaugural Board's invitation to become the Founding Patron of the Gallery in mid-1998. Since then he has enabled the acquisition of many key works for the Collection, and his support carried the Gallery to the opening of its new, dedicated home in December 2008. \\n\\nJiawei Shen (b. 1948) who painted the portrait of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark for the National Portrait Gallery in 2005, often places his sitters within evocative dreamlike or remembered settings. The backdrop of his portrait of Darling suggests the competition-winning design for the dedicated National Portrait Gallery â€“ the project the Founding Patron long envisaged and urged. Set apart from the rest of the Collection in the Gordon Darling Hall, and seeming to capture some of the natural light of the space, his portrait hangs adjacent to the boards listing the many donors and benefactors to the institution.",

                            "Jiawei Shen was born in Manchuria and he ended up when he came to Australia, in Sydney sitting on Circular Quay doing sketches of passers-by and selling them. Fast foward about 15 years, he has painted me, he has painted the Princess of Denmark. Marilyn and I went out to his home in Bundoora, and he gave me a chair and said â€œIâ€™ve got to get ready, you sit in the chairâ€. So I sat in the chair and crossed my legs, and when he came back he siad â€œhold that, Iâ€™ll paint you like thatâ€. He was always someone who you felt you were never at a distance from. Iâ€™ve always loved the painting because itâ€™s got that personal feel about it. It was a great experience, and whenever I go back to the Portrait Gallery it gives me a lot of pleasure to see his work on the wall in the Gordon Darling Hall.",

Famous for their record-breaking flights, the co-pilots made the first successful trans-Pacific flight from California to Brisbane in 1928. During the First World War, Kingsford Smith served in the Australian Imperial Force, the Australian Flying Corps and the Royal Flying Corps, and was awarded the Military Cross for bravery. Ulm, who at 16 had been among the first troops to land at Gallipoli, and later served on the Western Front, had returned to Sydney with a vision of establishing a commercial airline. He became Kingsford Smithâ€™s business partner in 1927, and they founded the short-lived Australian National Airways in 1930. In 1934, Ulm went down in the sea between California and Hawaii; his body was never found. Kingsford Smith, too, disappeared, probably near the coast of Myanmar, on an attempt at the Britainâ€“Australia record.",

                            "The double portrait of Captain Charles Kingsford Smith and Captain Charles Ulm was painted by William Dargie in 1961 and measures 133.5 cm high by 108.8 cm wide.\\n\\nThe pair are presented against a brilliant blue sky with patches of white wispy cloud. Broad brushstrokes of light blue and pink give way to a greener bluish tint in the lower section of the background. The clouds descend into pale grey as the landscape blurs into the distance.\\n\\nBathed in sunlight, the men stand close together and are cropped at the hip. Captain Charles Ulm on our left, faces forward, half his body obscured by Sir Charles Kingsford Smith who stands in front, his body turned toward Ulm, side on.\\n\\nUlmâ€™s direct gaze is forward to us. He has wavy brown hair cut shorter around his prominent ears and a warm rosy tanned complexion. The light from his right creates shadows on the left side of his clear broad forehead and delineates his straight nose, plump cheeks and double chin. His arched dark eyebrows, narrowed laughing eyes and parted lips open his cheery face into a wide smile. \\n\\nUlm wears a beige and green scarf wrapped around his neck and tucked into his aviator jump suit, unzipped to form a V. The one-piece suit is uniformly steely blue grey, a large pocket with a silver button and open upper flap is visible on his right chest. The baggy suit puckers at his waist and upper arm, which is bent at the elbow, and allows his right hand to rest on his hip. Cropped at the bottom edge of the painting, a brown strap is visible looped around the top of his index finger. Although Ulm's left arm is unseen, wrapped behind the figure of Kingsford Smith, the fingers and the thumb of that hand rest on Kingsford Smith's left shoulder.\\n\\nSir Charles Kingsford Smith looks out to the right of the portrait with a similarly tanned complexion to Ulm. His brown leather aviator helmet sits tight on his skull over his ears and clips together under his chin. His round glass goggles are raised above his eyes and held tight against his forehead. With his long oval face in three-quarter profile, a shadow plays on the left side of his face, accentuating his straight eyebrows, drooped eyelids and blue eyes. He has pronounced cheek bones and a long slightly hooked nose. He too is smiling with closed lips, with a slight curved crease around both corners of his mouth. Kingsford Smith wears a chocolate brown leather flying jacket, one side flaps open across his chest and is lined in a beige green sheepskin. At his waist his hands clasp a long slim white folded paper.",

                            "Artist Jon Campbell knew Paul Kelly (b. 1955) for years through the Melbourne music scene before approaching him to make this portrait. Campbell felt there was a link between the themes and style of his own work (which has explored cars, rock music, surfing and life in the suburbs) and those of Kellyâ€™s. A singer, songwriter and producer, Kellyâ€™s songs refer to specific Australian places and people, and he sings with a marked Australian accent. Kellyâ€™s band went through a number of name changes, ultimately settling on Paul Kelly and The Messengers. Their major break came in 1986, when their double album _Gossip_ was one of the biggest Australian records of the year. The band made _Under the Sun_ (1987) before touring the USA. They disbanded in 1991, and Kelly branched into producing and acting as well as writing and performing. Though he has written most of his long and poetic song list alone, he has also collaborated brilliantly, particularly with First Nations performers including Archie Roach, Yothu Yindi and Kev Carmody, with whom he co-wrote the protest song â€˜From Little Things, Big Things Growâ€™. Of this portrait, Campbell says that the â€˜stripped back to essenceâ€™ quality reflects Kellyâ€™s spare and frank approach to music.",

                            "Hugh Ramsay studied at the National Gallery School in Melbourne before sailing to Europe on the same ship as fellow artist George Lambert in 1899. For 15 months he painted and partied in a cold, grimy Paris studio, gaining some critical success while depending on the Lamberts for an occasional hot meal. In 1902 four of his paintings were chosen for exhibition at the New Salon, Paris; this extraordinary achievement earned him the patronage of Dame Nellie Melba, a relative of his friend, artist Ambrose Patterson (1877â€“1967). Ramsay painted several portraits of Patterson, whose studio was in the same apartment block in Montparnasse. Here Patterson is captured in profile, with his left arm extended in a strong horizontal line that drops elegantly at the wrist over the back of a leather armchair. The portrait, gifted to Patterson in friendship, was damaged while stored in Belgium and subsequently cut down leaving only the top half of the figure. When Ramsay fell ill with tuberculosis, Melba funded his return to Victoria. He worked hard, amassing works for a solo exhibition (held at Melbaâ€™s rented home in Toorak) before dying at the age of 28.",

His dark deep-set eye has a dark shadow beneath it, strongly contrasting with his pale creamy skin. His nose is large and slightly hooked and there is the hint of a moustache on his upper lip, his pale pink lips partially open as if caught in conversation. His pointed chin and strong jaw line are intensely defined above his wide long neck.\\n\\nAmbrose wears a cream round-necked knitted jumper with a check shirt revealed at collar and cuffs.\\n\\nHis left hand draped across the back of the chair is clasping four long fine paint brushes. The twist of his torso is emphasized by folds in the jumper sweeping down from his left shoulder to the right-hand side of his waist.

                            "In Sir William Dargieâ€™s portrait, celebrated Western Arrernte/Aranda/Arrarnta artist Albert Namatjira (1902â€“1959) is painted in profile, seated on a rock, looking out across the blazing colours and ancient rock formations of his Country; landscapes he famously rendered in watercolour. Namatjira was born at Ntaria/Hermannsburg near Mparntwe/Alice Springs. His distinctive style, though often reductively perceived as consistent with a traditional Western landscape aesthetic, was rooted in deep ancestral connection and knowledge of the Lands spanning his fatherâ€™s Country around the MacDonnell Ranges and his motherâ€™s Country in the region of Palm Valley in Central Australia. Exhibiting from 1938 to great acclaim and working prolifically, demand for his paintings increased during the 1940s. Though Namatjira was well known by the 1950s, his life and career were impacted by widespread prejudice and inequality, and an Australian constitution that did not recognise First Nations people. It is a stark fact that Namatjira was the first Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person to receive citizenship in 1957. Even so, restrictions on his family and his community remained engrained and complex, ultimately leading to his death in 1959. Another portrait of Namatjira painted by Dargie won the Archibald Prize in 1956 â€“ the first time the winning work featured a First Nations subject.",

                            "The portrait is of Albert Namatjira by William Dargie, made in 1958 using oil paint on canvas laid on composition board and measuring 76 cm high by 61cm wide.\\n\\nThe Arrernte artist Albert Namatjira is depicted in a desert landscape, sitting calmly on a rock holding one of his own paintings. His figure takes up most of the composition against a distant desert background. \\n\\nThe bright blue desert sky fills the top two thirds of the background around and above Namatjira. In lively and breezy, mostly vertical, strokes, the painted sky starts in bold cerulean at the top of the painting and fades to sapphire and powder blue where it meets the distant purple mountains. Some horizontal paint strokes hint at faint clouds.\\n\\nLand occupies the lower third of the background. In the far distance a blurred mountain range of purples and dark blue runs along the horizon. The flat dirt is rendered in pale peachy oranges. Small blue green dashes and dots of paint suggest sparse and distant vegetation.\\n\\nNamatjira's seated figure, cropped at the shins, fills the foreground. His head is positioned in profile facing the left. His skin is warm shades of dark brown and umber. He has short black hair, thick and wavy, flecked with grey, which neatly follows the shape of his large ear. His forehead angles diagonally toward his prominent brow, creased gently with wrinkles. He has a bushy raised eyebrow, and deeply set brown eye gazing into the distance. His nose is straight and upturned, his mouth slightly open. He has strong cheekbones leading to plump jowls and a thick neck, around which sits a thin red bandana tucked into his white button-up shirt.\\n\\nNamatjira's body is turned slightly towards the left, following his gaze. His left arm is bent at the elbow, the forearm leaning casually on his left thigh, his hand and fingers gently hanging down. Between this hand and his raised right hand, he gently holds a sketch of a landscape, resting on his lap, and angled away from his body. The paper faces towards us directly, showing a watery sketch of a landscape scene. A large tree on the right with grey green foliage, bright blue mountains in the background and pale peachy orange dirt in the foreground. \\n\\nNamatjira has dark taupe pants, his knees are parted, and he sits on a low reddish-brown rock.",

                            "This portrait of artist George Duncan (1904â€“1974) by Alison Rehfisch is a characteristic example of her work: painted on hessian in a post-impressionist style that employs rhythmic, structured composition, simple forms and a bold yet harmonious use of colour. Rehfisch studied at Julian Ashtonâ€™s art school in Sydney but left at the age of 19 to marry. After her daughter started school, Rehfisch returned to painting, training at Antonio Dattilo-Rubboâ€™s atelier, where she met Duncan. She held her first show at the Blaxland Gallery in 1929 and began exhibiting with the Society of Artists in 1931. By this time, she and her husband had separated. Heading to London in 1933, she studied at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art. In 1938, Rehfisch returned to Sydney, where she and Duncan married in 1942. The couple were active in Sydneyâ€™s contemporary art community and exhibited their work together at Sydneyâ€™s Macquarie Galleries. In 1947 they moved to Berrima, painting the landscapes around Goulburn and the Southern Highlands before returning to Sydney in 1951 where Duncan became director of the influential David Jones Art Gallery.",

It becomes something thatâ€™s a passing thing that people are not quite aware of themselves.\\n\\nIâ€™ve always been interested in the elemental in art and in Australia with the background of Aboriginals. We find that many artists have expressed themselves in various ways on what should be the expression of the Australian beginnings, which is the Aboriginals. But I search for the elemental thing, the depths of their past, the feeling of them living in this country and so forth. But further than that, I do find in the Australian bush there is the spirit of the elemental. One can feel it. Youâ€™re aware of it when you go silently into it.\\n\\nWhen I am approaching painting of a landscape, I firstly am aware of my subject. I want to know more of it. I walk into it. I must walk around and round all those trees and into the distance and the space that fills them, to listen, to find that feeling thatâ€™s vibrating, so as I can set it down in the spirit of that thing which I think is the essence that I should express.",

                            "Although best known for his landscapes, Ray Crooke AM often painted people indoors against a window giving onto bright light, such as this portrait of The Rt Hon Sir Zelman Cowen (1919â€“2011). Academic, writer and former Governor-General, Cowen served in the navy in the Second World War and then went to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. From 1951 to 1966 he was dean of the law faculty at the University of Melbourne, and in 1970 he became Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland. Seven years later, at the invitation of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, he succeeded Sir John Kerr as Governor-General; during his five-year term he did much to restore the status of the vice-regal post. Returning to Oxford University in the 1980s, he became Provost of Oriel College and later Pro-Vice Chancellor. He published widely on aspects of law but also attempted to enhance public comprehension of constitutional issues, particularly advocating for Australia to become a republic. Cowenâ€™s autobiography, _A Public Life_, was published in 2006.",

                            "Committed to political and social justice, artist Noel Counihan painted miners, construction workers, demonstrations and other scenes of working-class life. This portrait of writer Alan Marshall AM OBE (1902â€“1984), painted in Counihanâ€™s Melbourne home studio, was reproduced on the cover of _The complete stories of Alan Marshall,_ published in 1977. Marshall contracted poliomyelitis at age six, and the vicissitudes and triumphs of his childhood are detailed in his best-selling autobiographical work, _I Can Jump Puddles_ (1955). The book has sold more than eight million copies and has been translated into 30 languages. Marshall wrote with great dedication from the early 1920s and in 1933 won the first of his three Australian Literary Society Short Story Awards. He wrote for _Workerâ€™s Voice_, the _Communist Review_ and the _Left Review_, _Smithâ€™s Weekly_, the _Bulletin_, _ABC Weekly_, _Bohemia_ and _Meanjin_. _These Are My People_, stories he collected while travelling with his wife Olive in a horse-drawn caravan through Victoria, was published in 1944. Late in life he worked on projects highlighting various challenges confronting people living with disability.",

                            "I think I wrote 20 short stories before I had one published and I won 12 literary competitions. When I won a competition, I imagined I must be good, and yet I couldnâ€™t get them published. So I had to keep on and I remember one of the stories that I won a prize with was called _A Little Son_ and it was a story of my mother away outback and it described the birth of one of my sisters. And she told me the story and it won the Australian Literature Societyâ€™s short story competition for one year and I had to read it out aloud. And I brought my mother in to listen to it; she was a very wonderful person. And there Iâ€™m describing how she had knotted towels at the head of her bed and while she was lying on this bed, away outback, with a blowing dust and the hessian above her head, and where father sometimes used to pierce it with a knife and catch the dust in a bucket; sheâ€™s lying there and she said â€˜All that I could rememberâ€™, she told me, very vividly, â€˜was the smell of the Myall wood stockwhip handle that was hanging at the end of the bedâ€™.\\n\\nSo I wrote that story and I liked it, but people seemed rather shocked at it at the time, to motherâ€™s astonishment. And I remember some woman coming up to her there and saying â€˜Your son must be marriedâ€™, and she said â€˜No, heâ€™s not, heâ€™s telling about meâ€™.\\n\\nWhen I began working in the city, that was the sad time of my life. See I think that when youâ€™re crippled, childhood is fairly happy. It is not the affliction that makes life hard but the attitude of people towards it, and this manifests itself very strongly in your teens. That is the time when you want to grab a girl. And Iâ€™ve described this period, although not very well Iâ€™m afraid, in In _Mine Own Heart_.\\n\\nWhat I wanted to do was to describe how I broke through this feeling of restriction, of sadness, and I succeeded in doing it but I havenâ€™t quite succeeded in doing it as I wanted to do in my books. I have one more to write at the time of speaking and that will describe that period of my life when I moved round with artists and writers and when I became much more confident in myself.",

                            "Margaret Olley AC was an integral part of the community of artists who shaped the Sydney art scene after the Second World War. Her circle of friends and colleagues included Jeffrey Smart, Russell Drysdale and William Dobell, whose portrait of Olley was awarded the 1948 Archibald Prize. Her first solo exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries in Sydney the same year was a sell-out, and from that beginning, she held at least one solo exhibition annually. Her legacy is not only as a painter but as an arts patron and benefactor: since its foundation in 1990, the Margaret Olley Art Trust has donated many Australian and international artworks to public collections nationwide. Tweed River Art Gallery is home to the Margaret Olley Art Centre, which includes a reproduction of Olleyâ€™s studio and living space.\\n\\nThough considered primarily a painter of interiors and still life, Olley was involved in portraiture consistently throughout her career, and her self portraits are a wonderful synthesis of both aspects of her practice. Employing the mirror motif, this self portrait is simultaneously evocative of both her inner life and the vivid, external world of her home and studio â€“ bursting with flowers, fruit, artworks and artefacts â€“ in which she found endless inspiration.",

                            "I have many ways of working. One is working directly from a model or from using a still life. This I donâ€™t arrange and then paint it immediately; I always have a very definite idea what I want to do. Sometimes it doesnâ€™t come off immediately, sometimes it does, and this is a very satisfying thing. Other times I paint say for a whole day, and then leave it for several weeks; it might go on for months or even six weeks, taking out something, repainting again.\\n\\nI very rarely make a detailed sketch of what I intend to do. I might make little thumbnail notes but never very detailed, because I feel you kill the painting you want to do.\\n\\nPainting to me is like drawing; you draw with your brush or your palette knife, so whether one is using a paintbrush or watercolour or a pen, itâ€™s all creative, and I never mind which medium Iâ€™m using.\\n\\nThe paintings I do are naturally things I â€“ Iâ€™m inspired whether itâ€™s the colour, the shape; it might be the colour of the skin of a native woman, it doesnâ€™t matter.\\n\\nI can hear myself saying things that are so trite, and theyâ€™re not really how I want to say them.

                            "Artist Jinx Nolanâ€™s vibrant painting of writer Murray Bail (b. 1941) recalls many of her adoptive father Sidney Nolanâ€™s portraits in its expressive execution and simplicity of form. It is a diminutive yet distinctive work, a modern-day â€˜miniatureâ€™ that demonstrates wit and verve. \\n\\nBail has created enduring, distinctive and original stories on Australian themes and experiences. He spent several years in London in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where he wrote for the _Transatlantic Review_ and the _Times Literary Supplement_, and published his first book of short stories, _Contemporary Portraits and Other Stories_ in 1975. His first novel _Homesickness_ (1980) won the National Book Council Award and shared the Age Book of the Year Award; _Holdenâ€™s Performance_ (1987) won the 1988 Victorian Premierâ€™s Award for fiction. His critically acclaimed 1998 novel _Eucalyptus_, which won the Miles Franklin Award, Australiaâ€™s most prestigious literary prize, has been voted one of the top 20 must-read Australian novels. In 2021 he published his collection of autobiographical writings, _He_.",

                            "Well-known for her sophisticated portraits of assured, commanding women, Violet Teagueâ€™s elegant and vivacious painting of charity worker, arts patron and feminist Mary Chomley OBE (1872â€“1960) was considered a stand-out when shown in a solo exhibition held at the Guild Hall in Melbourne in 1909. Chomley was founder of the Victorian Arts and Crafts Society, where she met Teague, and secretary of the committee who organised the _First Australian Exhibition of Womenâ€™s Work_ in Melbourne in 1907, now considered a landmark event in the history of womenâ€™s art in Australia. After travelling to England in June 1914, Chomley was prevented from returning home by the outbreak of the First World War. She threw herself into work: teaching English to refugees and volunteering at the Robert Lindsay Memorial Hospital for Officers. In 1916 she joined the Australian Red Cross, coordinating a team of volunteers to distribute thousands of parcels to Australian prisoners of war, who described her as the â€˜divine angel of mercyâ€™. Remaining in London after the armistice, Chomley worked with organisations investigating working conditions and opportunities for British immigrant women in Australia. She returned permanently to Melbourne in 1934, resuming her work with the Victoria League for Commonwealth Friendship and the Arts and Crafts Society.",

                            "Fred Williamsâ€™ unique landscape vision emerged in the late 1950s, after his return from a period of study and work in London. The 1960s saw an increasing minimalism in his paintings, which reached its most extreme point at the end of the decade. His monumental works of 1969 sought to evoke the scale of the Australian landscape through canvases of a single colour dotted with tiny flecks of paint. The bare, uncompromising pictures contributed profoundly to subsequent Australian interpretations of place.\\n\\nThis painting, one of the very first acquisitions of the National Portrait Gallery, was the last and most considered of his few self portraits. The work of painting is emphasised; this is no tousle-haired, tortured genius but a serious artist going about his business. The treatment of the jacket is reminiscent of that of rocks and trees in his landscapes of the same period and the work is characteristically enlivened with touches of vibrant colour on cheekbones and ears.",

                            "South African-born Florence Fuller was a child when her family emigrated to Victoria. At 16 she enrolled at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, and she later studied with her uncle, the distinguished portraitist Robert Dowling. In 1891 she was described as â€˜a young artist, who by her clever and conscientious work, has placed herself among the best Australian portrait paintersâ€™. In Europe from 1893, she studied at the AcadÃ©mie Julian in Paris and exhibited at the Salon, and at the Royal Academy and the Royal Institute of Oil Painters in London. After returning to Australia in 1904 she settled in Perth and established a studio in the building that housed the offices of the newspaper, the _West Australian_. Consequently, she came to the attention of Sir John Winthrop Hackett â€“ the newspaperâ€™s owner â€“ who commissioned Fuller to paint at least two portraits of his wife Deborah Vernon Hackett (1887â€“1965). Later the Lady Mayoress of Adelaide, a mining company director and a charity fundraiser, Deborah was 18 when she married Hackett in August 1905. The tea gown in this portrait of her by Fuller matches descriptions of the one Lady Hackett changed into before setting off on her honeymoon.",

It breaks much new ground. It treats practically with problems with which the Australian mother of a family and the Australian housekeeper are confronted day by day, year in and year out. No effort has been spared to make the work the most generally useful publication on the subject of domestic economy which has emanated from the Australian press.\\n\\nThe series of articles which it contains embraces such various subjects as: _Foods; their Functions and Values, The Australian Baby, The Kindergarten, What Young People Should Know, General Hygiene, Home Nursing, Hints upon Personal Appearance, The Home Garden, Poultry Keeping, Domestic Animals and The Typhoid or House Fly_ and _Insect Pests_.\\n\\nEach of these articles has been written by an expert, who speaks with authority upon the subject treated of. The recipes, some 3,500 in number and dealing with every branch of the culinary art and every department of household management have not been collected or collated haphazard [sic] but carefully selected by competent advisers, the great majority being actually contributed and vouched for by the correspondents, whose reliability and knowledge every reasonable care has been taken to ascertain and determine.\\n\\nSince the entire net proceeds of _The Australian Household Guide_ are to be devoted to charities it is hoped that its reception in Australian homes and its appreciation by Australian mothers will warrant the early publication of a second edition.",

                            "This portrait of Deborah Vernon Hackett was made around 1908 by Florence Ada Fuller. It is painted with oil on canvas and measures 82 centimetres tall by 64 centimetres wide. The ornate gold frame is 13 centimetres wide. At the lower edge in the centre of the frame in black handwritten print is the inscription Mrs J.W. Hackett aet. 16. and beneath this F.A. Fuller.\\n\\nThe young woman is painted realistically with light brushstrokes and soft edges. She is positioned centrally, taking up the bottom two thirds of the canvas in front of a plain dark background. Deborah looks directly towards us. She is visible to her thigh which is seated in a cane chair. \\n\\nThe background is dark olive green. Vertical lines near the top of the painting suggest the folds of a curtain. This graduates to deep shadows that are almost black on the lower left.\\n\\nDeborah wears a large black hat with a low flat crown. A few dashes of paint indicate a bow of gauzy ribbon peeping above the wide brim that sweeps upwards on either side of her head. Her medium-brown hair is drawn off her forehead and curves up and out, giving volume and framing her face. The rest of the hair hangs loose behind her, with a small section falling in gentle waves over her left shoulder. \\n\\nLight touches Deborahâ€™s face from the right of the painting, leaving the left side in partial shadow. Her oval face has a smooth fair complexion and cheeks tinged with delicate pink. Her brown eyebrows are fine and straight. Deborahâ€™s sea-blue eyes look directly at us, their outer edges follow a slightly downwards lilt. Her nose is straight, leading to small shapely lips. The corners of her mouth are slightly upturned, the rose-pink lips are closed. Deborah has a faint groove just beneath her lower lip and a little round chin.\\n\\nA band of cream open lacework encircles Deborahâ€™s neck and extends over her chest. It is secured beneath her chin with a slender gold pin. A long strand of pale pink irregularly shaped stones also hangs about her neck. Her dress is light blue-green, and the fabric looks almost sheer, with a subtle silk-like sheen. Cream-coloured lace runs horizontally across the upper bodice, further ornamented in the middle of her chest by an oblong-shaped reddish gold pin. The sleeves are embellished with lace above the elbows and on the lower edges of the cuffs.\\n\\nThe cuffs of her wide sleeves hang elegantly from her wrists, creating strong almost-vertical lines in parallel with the arm of the straw-coloured cane chair. Deborahâ€™s left hand, displaying the glint of a gold band on her ring finger, is lightly placed over her right on the top of the chairâ€™s arm. Beneath her hands the rounded scroll-shaped edge of the chair is emphasized by its plaited edge.\\n\\nThe back of the cane chair curves down from the arm around her body following the sloping line of Deborahâ€™s left hip at the lower right of the painting. On the bottom left the artistâ€™s signature F. A. Fuller can be seen faintly in brownish pink over the dark background.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucinda Shawcross and voiced by Amy Middleby**",

                            "Judy Cassab AO CBE completed her first portrait when she was 12, and later said painting â€˜was the only thing in life I wanted to doâ€™. Her studies at the Academy of Art in Prague ended when war broke out in 1939; she later resumed her studies in Budapest before adopting false papers and â€˜going undergroundâ€™ to escape the persecution of Jewish people. When Cassab began painting again, in 1945, she wrote that sheâ€™d â€˜never let this happen again, this parting from paint and brushâ€™. Soon after arriving in Sydney in 1951 with her husband and two sons, she began securing portrait commissions, and in 1955 her portrait of model Judy Barraclough won the _Australian Womenâ€™s Weekly_ Portrait Prize. The win helped establish Cassabâ€™s reputation for portraits that were distinctly modern yet sufficiently traditional, leading to further portraits of sitters from the fashion world â€“ including June Dally-Watkins OAM (1927â€“2020). Dally-Watkins rose to prominence in the late 1940s with her modelling work for David Jones and magazines including the _Womenâ€™s Weekly_. In 1950 she founded the June Dally-Watkins School for deportment and etiquette, and in 1951 established Australiaâ€™s first modelling agency.",

                            "Jiawei Shen often juxtaposes contradictory elements in his paintings to indicate his sitterâ€™s history or situation. This painting of HM Queen Mary of Denmark (b. 1972) is a study for his â€˜court portraitâ€™, where he placed the then Crown Princess alongside a column based on the architecture of Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen; in the background lies the Sydney Opera House, designed by Danish architect JÃ¸rn Utzon. Shen commenced work on the portrait in Sydney in February 2005, when the Princess made her first royal tour of her homeland. Given the limited time available for the sitting, the artist took many photographs and made several studies and sketches, which were acquired along with the finished painting.\\n\\nBorn Mary Donaldson in Hobart, she gained a degree in commerce and law from the University of Tasmania in 1994. Completing further qualifications in advertising, she worked as an account manager in Melbourne, Edinburgh and Sydney. She met the then Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, like her, an adroit sportsperson, when he visited Sydney for the 2000 Olympic Games. Moving to Denmark in 2002, she studied Danish history and language before her marriage to Frederik in Copenhagen Cathedral on 14 May 2004.",

So I say that maybe my newness of life maybe is the kangaroo.\\n\\nI already become Australian citizen in Canberra since 1998, but otherwise I had 40 years life experience in China, so we are half-half. I become like this. Very special meaning. Both equal.\\n\\nFrom the window straight away we can see the Opera House. Princess Mary is Australian and married with a Danish prince, and theyâ€™ve come to Denmark. The Opera House is designed by a Danish architect, so this is just a two cultural with come here, with come there. But I think this is a very good symbol.\\n\\nWe have for three hours just to know this time I can only do some I shot many photographs. Then I did for about a half hour, do a sketch, head study. And the dress, the colour, and even the hairstyle, I really love that. Such a beautiful lady.\\n\\nÂ ",

                            "Lady Maisie Drysdale (1915â€“2001), childrenâ€™s librarian and artistsâ€™ muse, met Peter Purves Smith and Russell Drysdale at George Bellâ€™s art school in Melbourne. In 1935 Drysdale married Elizabeth â€˜Bonâ€™ Stephens and two years later, Purves Smith left for Europe, followed in 1938 by Maisie and her mother. This portrait of Maisie by her husband-to-be is thought to have been painted while they were both in London, before he joined the British Army in 1940. The restricted colour palette and energetically painted blue background focuses our attention on Maisieâ€™s striking profile, framed by her fur collar.\\n\\nAfter Maisie returned to Australia, Purves Smith cabled his proposal to her but they were separated for the duration of the war. They married in 1946 in Melbourne, with Drysdale as best man; however, Purves Smith died following surgery to relieve symptoms of tuberculosis in 1949. Maisie completed library studies and became a librarian at the City of Coburg Library and later, the Camberwell City Library. She also served on the Editorial Committee of the Childrenâ€™s Book Council of Victoria. In 1963, Bon Drysdale died, and seven months later Maisie married Russell Drysdale. They bought a block of land near Gosford, Bouddi Farm, where they lived for the rest of their lives.",

                            "Rosemary Valadonâ€™s large-scale oil paintings are characterised by theatricality and opulence, feminist agency and vitality. Between 1990 and 1996 she completed _The Goddess Series_, portraits of Australian women as mythological/archetypal figures, referring to them as â€˜a testimony to the goodness and healing powers of womenâ€™. Her sitters included actor Ruth Cracknell AM (1925â€“2002), who considered this painting to be her definitive portrait. Cracknell became a household name through her character Maggie Beare in the ABC comedy _Mother and Son_, which ran from 1985 to 1994. Over five decades she appeared in many theatre, television, radio and film productions, including _A Cup of Tea, a Bex and a Good Lie Down_ at the Phillip Street Theatre and a memorable performance as Lady Bracknell in _The Importance of Being Earnest_ for the Melbourne and Sydney theatre companies. After writing her autobiography _A Biased Memoir_ (1997), she published an account of her experience of grief following the death of her husband of 41 years, Eric Phillips, _Journey from Venice_ (2000). In 2001 she received the Gold Logie Hall of Fame Award and a lifetime achievement award at the Helpmann Awards. Cracknell was also an influential spokesperson for older Australian women and an advocate for First Nations rights.",

                            "Noel Fraser Hickey (1921â€“2010) worked as a photographer with Kodak before serving with the Australian Imperial Force in the Second World War. He then started his own studio in Sydney, specialising in headshots and portfolio photography for aspiring fashion models. Artist Nancy Menetrey worked for Hickey as a negative retoucher, and this portrait of her sharply dressed boss was a finalist in the 1957 Archibald Prize. Among her other portrait subjects were Pat Woodley, the 1950 Miss New South Wales, who founded her own modelling agency in Sydney, and who is pictured in the photograph being held by Hickey in this painting. In the 1950s Menetrey was the first woman to join Sydneyâ€™s St George Art Society, which has since named its award for contemporary and abstract painting after her. Her portraits featured in the Portia Geach Memorial Award several times in the 1970s.",

                            "Graeme Drendelâ€™s paintings capture isolated individuals in vast, stark landscapes, often inspired by the Mallee region in Victoria, where the artist grew up. In contrast, this portrait of friend and fellow artist, Dr Jill Orr (b. 1952), is small and intimate. Painted in one sitting in Drendelâ€™s Melbourne studio, he stood just a metre or so away from Orr as he captured the bristling texture of her auburn hair and deeply etched features, working quickly and confidently in deftly applied oil paint. \\n\\nOrr is a contemporary artist whose performance-based works and installations interrogate social and political issues, environmental concerns, gender and the relationship between identity and place. Trained as an art teacher, she began exhibiting at the Ewing and George Paton Gallery at Melbourne University in the late 1970s. Since then, her work has been shown in numerous solo and group exhibitions in Australia and overseas.",

                            "Of her portrait of award-winning writer Peter Goldsworthy AM (b. 1951), Deidre But-Husaim said: â€˜I wanted to convey the process of trying to bring a thing or an idea into being â€¦ I wanted to offer a glimpse of the inner private world of Peter alone with his imagination, all unformed possibilities before him.â€™ In that large-scale painting, Goldsworthy turns away from the viewer, looking out through a shuttered window while seated at his desk. In this preliminary painting, however, But-Husaim completed a sensitive study of his face. \\n\\nGoldsworthyâ€™s first book of poetry, _Readings from Ecclesiastes_, won the Commonwealth Poetry Prize, the South Australian Premierâ€™s Award, and was joint winner of the Anne Elder Poetry Award in 1982. His debut novel, _Maestro_ (1989), was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award. Subsequent works include _Three Dog Night_ (2003), which won the Christina Stead Award; and _Everything I Knew_ (2008), which was shortlisted for the Prime Ministerâ€™s Literature Award. Also an essayist and screenwriter, he wrote the libretti for the operas _Summer of the Seventeenth Doll_ and _Batavia_, the latter winning him a Helpmann Award in 2002.",

                            "Noel McKennaâ€™s spare linear style and paintings of everyday scenarios often feature animals and interiors. In this portrait he has depicted art collector and dealer Joseph Brown AO OBE (1918â€“2009) in a pared-back gallery setting with John Brackâ€™s painting _Two Typists_ (1955) in the background. \\n\\nBrown arrived in Australia from Poland in 1933. Having studied painting and sculpture, he exhibited his works in the 1960s, however he is best known as a gallerist who fostered the careers of emerging Australian artists and facilitated appreciation of the work of their historical antecedents. Having established the Joseph Brown Gallery in Collins Street, Melbourne, in 1967, he built up one of the finest private art collections in Australia, and made such substantial contributions to Australian art history that he was awarded three honorary doctorates. His gift of more than 150 works to the National Gallery of Victoria in 2004 is one of the most generous donations of artworks to a public collection in Australia. Brown purchased _Two Typists_ for his own private collection (the red dot in McKennaâ€™s work capturing this moment) and it was later among the artworks he donated to the NGV.",

Tam managed the business aspects, while Anne dealt with the art. As a team, they pioneered professional dealing in contemporary art in Australia, promoting the careers of artists who became some of the most significant names in 20th-century Australian art. \\n\\nJohn Brack began exhibiting at the Australian Galleries in 1957. Although he didnâ€™t consider himself a portraitist, he created a number of portraits that, like his paintings of unnamed people and faces, are finely observed, sometimes austere examinations of everyday life and experiences. As his widow Helen Brack explained: â€˜In Johnâ€™s view, mere likenesses were not portraits; a portrait was about identity, the disposition â€“ not the persona â€“ and the whole picture was the portrait, the configuration in the rectangle and use of picture space.â€™ She said of this painting: â€˜here is an essay about a businessman, and John makes no concessions.â€™ Perpetuated by the Purvesâ€™ son Stuart, Australian Galleries is still in operation and is Australiaâ€™s longest-surviving commercial art business.",

                            "Between 1937 and 1974 Lina Bryans OAM painted more than 70 portraits of her artistic and literary contemporaries, providing a visual chronicle of the Melbourne cultural scene. She met architect and designer Alex Jelinek (1925â€“2007) in 1954 and they fell into an intense and rewarding relationship that lasted until Bryansâ€™ passing in 2000. Jelinek graduated from the technical building school of Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ©, near Prague, during the Second World War. In 1946 he became attached to the architectural school of the Prague Academy of Fine Arts, but fled communist Czechoslovakia to live as a displaced person in West Germany. In 1950 he emigrated to Australia on a labour contract, laying track and then working on the Eucumbene Dam site before meeting Bryans. Jelinek drew brilliant designs for far more structures than were ever realised. For Bryansâ€™ second cousin, Canberra academic Bruce Benjamin, he carried out the spiral â€˜Round Houseâ€™ in Gawler Crescent, Deakin, which was named Australian House of the Year in 1957 and is now heritage-listed. This uncompromisingly minimal portrait held pride of place for decades in the coupleâ€™s homes in East Melbourne, Richmond and Kew.",

                            "Yellow Portrait (Portrait of Alex Jelinek), is a portrait of a Czech-born architect who is best known for his contribution to experimental modernism in Australia in the 1950â€™s.\\n\\nThe work is 184cm high and 123 cm wide with a thin aluminium frame. Alex Jelinek is shown engrossed in his work, wearing his trademark thick, dark framed glasses (that he designed himself). Jelinek and the whole canvas, are enveloped in a rich mustard-yellow. \\n\\nHe sits at an angle, left shoulder turned to us. Although Jelinek has been painted centrally in the large work, he is an outline, rising out of the yellow from a collection of carefully chosen brushstrokes and smudges in dark brown, dark-red and a small amount of white. \\n\\nJelinekâ€™s thick, side-parted, dark-brown hair accentuates his high forehead, his medium â€“ length hair is tousled at the crown and cropped to reveal the shell of his left ear, though there is no anatomical detail within it. Jelinekâ€™s glasses rest on the bridge of his nose, his eyes are downcast towards his work. His eyebrows are thick and straight beneath the frames of his glasses. \\n\\nHe has a sharp, unremarkable nose and a robust, brown moustache. Beneath his moustache smudges of red. A shadow rests under the clean line of his jaw. His head is dipped towards the focus of his gaze. \\n\\nGrey brushstrokes fill in the breadth of his left shoulder. Jelinekâ€™s shirt collar is an assured, mountainous squiggle. At his nape, below his neatly rendered chin, a dark brown, shallow â€œvâ€ marks Jelinekâ€™s open-necked shirt. A brown line descends down his chest surrounded by smudged white in place of a seam with buttons, and tapers off abruptly. A few vertical dark brown, wavy lines and a confident horizontal line illustrate a tucked in, loose-fitting shirt at his waist. \\n\\nJelinek is slim with a youthful build. Dark, confident brushstrokes form a dark hip in high waisted trousers. A fading horizontal line at his waist disappears into the pervasive mustard- yellow, A wonky rectangle of rolled up, rumpled shirtsleeve and light lines indicate his bent elbow and forearm.\\n\\nJelinekâ€™s design bench onto which he is ardently focused is a greenish grey line that starts on the left halfway down the portrait, cutting through the yellow-gold and descending on an angle towards the bottom right, where it veers back in a long, gentle, freehand arch, before stopping abruptly in the middle at the bottom of the work.\\n\\nThe artist Lina Bryans has signed her name in the lower right corner as just â€˜Linaâ€™ in large, light cursive letters.",

                            "Artist Judy Cassab owned a 1966 stoneware ceramic piece, _Dial_, by Marea Gazzard AM (1928â€“2013), one of Australiaâ€™s leading ceramicists. It has been suggested that it was perhaps exchanged for this portrait of Gazzard that Cassab painted in the same year. Gazzard trained at the East Sydney Technical College and London Central School for Arts and Craft before setting up a studio in Sydney in 1960. In 1973, with fibre artist Mona Hessing, Gazzard was one of the first craftspeople invited to exhibit at the National Gallery of Victoria. The resulting exhibition, _Clay + Fibre_, generated much discussion about whether craft was art and accelerated the visibility of women artists. Instrumental in craft being taken seriously in Australia, Gazzard helped to set up the Crafts Council of Australia, chaired the Crafts Board of the Australia Council and was President of the World Crafts Council. Through the 1970s and 1980s she exhibited large abstract works in a number of important group shows and solo exhibitions, and was commissioned to create the bronze sculpture _Mingarri: The Little Olgas_ (1988), which stands in the central Executive Courtyard of Parliament House.",

                            "I think the thing that really concerns me is form. Sometimes Iâ€™m asked where I get my ideas from and itâ€™s hard to say, sometimes it might be sitting in a movie, just a certain shape flicks across the screen and I think â€˜Thatâ€™s just what Iâ€™m looking forâ€™, or on a beach a piece of driftwood, or in the park a squashed fig. Anything can supply it when youâ€™re looking, when youâ€™re feeling the need for a new idea.\\n\\nIâ€™d say that the curve is the thing that interests me, seldom the straight line in an object. Iâ€™m very sensitive to curves, a wrong curve can ruin it from the first half-inch. If I know itâ€™s somehow not going to be right, I just break it up. I break up a lot of things; in fact in my studio at the moment I can see six or eight things that I will no doubt smash up. Perhaps itâ€™s the scale thatâ€™s important in what I do. I keep being dissatisfied with small things, though they can be fun to do at times. I want to do bigger, more massive objects.\\n\\nI never feel so happy as when Iâ€™m quietly working alone. And I have everything here to make my work, the kiln, all. An artist has to be very close to his work. I know when Iâ€™ve been looking in museums, Iâ€™ve often felt that Iâ€™ve known the person whoâ€™s made that object. Perhaps this doing of oneâ€™s own work, oneâ€™s own thing, perhaps this is the link between civilisations. Other civilisations have tried to leave us what they knew. Perhaps this is what itâ€™s about.",

                            "Portraitist Howard Barronâ€™s commissions included Sir Winston Churchill, Queen Elizabeth II and Dame Nellie Melba. This portrait of operatic soprano Florence Austral (1892â€“1968) was likely painted when the diva toured Australia in 1930. Barronâ€™s portrait presents a clear statement about Australâ€™s success, portraying her as a confident woman in a theatrical pose.\\n\\nBorn Florence Wilson, she studied at the Conservatorium of Music and the University of Melbourne. On arriving in London, she, like her compatriot Nellie Melba, adopted a name honouring her homeland and as â€˜Florence Australâ€™ debuted in the role of BrÃ¼nnhilde in Wagnerâ€™s _Die WalkÃ¼re_ at Covent Garden in 1922. During the 1920s and 1930s she toured North America and Australia and made the first of many recordings. The quality and power of her voice lent itself to the Wagnerian roles that secured her reputation, but she also performed in operas by Verdi, Mozart and Puccini. By the end of the 1930s, Austral was increasingly afflicted with multiple sclerosis. With her husband, flautist John Amadio, she returned to Australia after the war and took up a teaching position at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music in Newcastle.",

                            "Russian-born George Lambert came to Australia as a teenager, by which time he demonstrated a prodigious talent in drawing. He worked as a jackeroo on his great-uncleâ€™s property near Gilgandra, New South Wales before being advised to go to art school. He won the Wynne Prize in 1899, and in 1900 he left for Europe having been awarded the NSW Society of Artistsâ€™ Travelling Scholarship. He remained abroad until 1921, studying and working in Paris and London and serving as an official war artist with the Australian Imperial Force.\\n\\n_Self portrait with gladioli_, arguably the most definitive of Lambertâ€™s several self portraits, was painted after he became the first Australian artist elected as an associate of the Royal Academy in London, and following his return to Australia. The artist stands beside a cut-crystal vase arranged with plumes of gladioli, wearing a dandyish corduroy cuffed smoking jacket. In a letter Lambert wrote to his wife Amy in 1921 he plays up to the perceived image of him as foppish aesthete: â€˜I am a luxury, a hot house rarity â€¦ Scoffed at for preciousness. Despised for resembling a chippendale chair in a country where timber is cheap.â€™ And yet, Lambert was a working artist â€“ and his hands, strong and indelicate, are those of a craftsman.",

                            "Self portrait with gladioli by George Lambert. This is a commanding oil painting on canvas and including the frame, 159cm high and 132cm wide. The elaborate gold frame has a double edge and is approximately 30cm wide with ornate textured, gold foliage decorating the corners and central sections of each side. \\n\\nGeorge is larger than life, from his upper thigh to the crown of his head, wearing a luxurious robe and assuming a flamboyant pose. Standing at ease, his back arched, with one hand on his hip and the other hand extended upwards in an affected gesture. \\n\\nGeorge stands in the centre of the composition, against a matt, deep purple background. His body is on an angle with his left upper arm obscured from view, and his face turned towards us. \\n\\nGeorgeâ€™s hairline is receding. His remaining hair is short and swept back behind his ears, revealing right ear. His hair is light brown, with blond and copper highlights. His pale, dome shaped forehead has a sheen across it. He has a slightly furrowed brow, between full eyebrows, drawn over hazel eyes hooded with heavy eyelids. He looks directly at us with a weary yet quizzical gaze. \\n\\nHis cheeks are flushed a rosy pink and his nose is long and straight with flared nostrils. He has a neat manicured moustache, the ends of which are waxed and turned upwards, extending just beyond the slightly upturned corners of his mouth. His pink, full lips are closed around a black pipe, which dangles from the left-hand side of his mouth. His well- groomed beard follows his jaw line, trimmed close to his cheeks and then from his chin it is longer, thicker and shaped to a blunt point.\\n\\nHe wears a sumptuous old gold velvet smoking jacket with wide, dark taupe corduroy lapels and cuffs, with deep pockets on either side in the front.\\n\\nThe jacket gapes at the front, revealing his slim chest. Around his neck, the stiff high collar of an ivory, cotton dress shirt over which is draped a long violet and white silk scarf and the hint of a dark taupe and gold ribbon.\\n\\nThe velvet fabric hangs in heavy folds around his slight frame, cinched in at the waist with a belt tied in a bow. The jacket is lined with mustard satin that is only visible inside the left sleeve opening. The ample sleeves of the jacket fall back to his wrists, flaunting french cuffs and cuff links. His left arm is held mid-air and crooked at the elbow, palm facing out, fingers stretched up and curled in. \\n\\nHis right hand is deliberately placed on his right hip, with thumb to the rear and fingers with swollen knuckles splayed. \\n\\nIn the lower right-hand corner is a glass vase with a curved handle containing four stems of gladioli of varying lengths and colours red, pink and creamy white. In the lower left-hand corner is the artistâ€™s signature, G. Lambert, Sydney 1922.",

                            "Melbourne-born artist Ivy Shore (1915â€“1999) was raised in Adelaide and moved to Sydney in 1938, marrying financier Ray Shore. In the late 1950s, she enrolled in painting classes with Graeme Inson, who trained her in the methods of his art teacher, Max Meldrum. On separating from her husband in 1960, she bought her own house in Woollahra, and two years later, Inson moved in. He painted several portraits of Shore, but thought this one best expressed the principles of tonal realism. Inson kept the work and exhibited it repeatedly to demonstrate his style of portraiture to would-be clients and sitters. Through the 1960s, in her own painting Shore moved away from the principles Inson had taught her and began to focus on entering the Portia Geach Memorial Award instead of the Archibald Prize. She won in 1979 with her portrait of trade unionist Della Elliott. Shore used her prize money to have a studio built above the garage of her house, so that she could paint away from Inson and his disapproval of her â€˜non-Meldrumiteâ€™ style. Shore continued to exhibit in the Portia Geach Award until 1992.",

                            "Tom Roberts had a profound influence on Australian art. An organiser of the 1899 _9 by 5 Impression Exhibition_ in Melbourne, he promoted the principles of Impressionism and painting en plein air (outdoors). He also advocated for quintessentially Australian subject matter, as seen in his famous landscape paintings such as _Shearing the rams_ and _A break away_. However, portraiture was also an important part of his practice. This portrait of lawyer and judge Sir Alexander Campbell Onslow (1842â€“1908), the third Chief Justice of Western Australia, is thought to be a study for a larger, more formal commissioned work that seems never to have eventuated. It was painted in 1896, the year in which Roberts commenced work on a series of informal portraits of significant figures in Australian society, exhibited as â€˜Familiar faces and figuresâ€™.",

                            "Irish portraitist Reginald Gray painted many celebrated subjects including Samuel Beckett, Francis Bacon, Helena Bonham Carter, Juliette Binoche, Yves Saint Laurent and the Prince of Brunei. He began this portrait soon after he met the Australian writer and critic Jill Neville (1932â€“1997) in Paris in 1967. They lost touch before it was completed, and he finished the canvas as a tribute to Neville when he heard the news of her death 30 years later. \\n\\nNeville left Sydney for London in the early 1950s, initially living on a Chelsea houseboat. When her brother Richard Neville arrived in London, she introduced him to people who helped launch the English incarnation of his magazine _Oz_, the first issues of which were published from her Bayswater home. In 1966 she published her first novel, _Fall-Gir_l, which drew on her tumultuous relationships with the poets Peter Porter and Robert Lowell. Moving to Paris the following year, she went on to write six more novels, the last three of which explored the experience of individuals torn between Europe and Australia. Through the 1980s and early 1990s she was a regular reviewer for the _Independent_, the _Times Literary Supplement_, the _Observer_, _London Magazine_ and the _Australian_.",

                            "Stylesetter and art collector Kathleen â€˜Kateâ€™ Hattam (1923â€“2004) was a significant early collector of Clifton Pughâ€™s work. London-born, she met her future husband Hal Hattam, an Australian obstetrician, in England during the Second World War. After returning to Melbourne, the Hattams established close friendships with a group of emerging artists who have since become household names. At Kateâ€™s behest, artists including John Perceval, Arthur Boyd and Leonard French designed wrapping paper and greeting cards for Georges department store in Melbourne, where she was advertising manager. The Hattam family homes in Canterbury and South Yarra housed a significant collection of works by artists in their circle and beyond. \\n\\nPugh was a close friend of the Hattams and they championed his work. They went regularly to his home, Dunmoochin, on weekends, and also saw the Pughs at Shoreham, where each family had a house. This portrait captures Hattamâ€™s style and determination in Pughâ€™s characteristic elongated forms and bold colour against an abstract background. The artist recalled that it was rare for him to make portraits in this period, â€˜but then of course, I knew Kate so well. It was a picture that I wanted to doâ€™.",

                            "Artist Jean Bellette (1908â€“1991) built her reputation on painting neoclassical figures in landscapes, for which she won the Sulman Prize twice, in 1942 and 1944. She also contributed illustrated articles to _Art in Australia_ and taught at the East Sydney Technical College. In 1954, Bellette and her husband, artist and art critic Paul Haefliger, bought a cottage in Hill End, New South Wales, where they hosted many of their friends including Russell Drysdale, Margaret Olley and John Olsen. From 1957 onwards the couple lived in Mallorca, Spain, where she painted some of her finest works. \\n\\nDuring the 1930s, artist, writer and critic Adrian Lawlor studied at George Bellâ€™s school in Melbourne and in 1938, alongside modernists including Bell, Noel Counihan and Albert Tucker, formed the Contemporary Art Society. In 1939, two years after Lawlor painted this portrait of Bellette, more than 200 of his paintings were destroyed in a bushfire at his Warrandyte home, and he stopped painting. Subsequently, he became a critic for newspapers and journals, and presented a regular art show on ABC radio.",

                            "We came back to Sydney just before war broke out and [were] very glad to be home at last; although the travelling had been magnificent, it did not give so much time for really trying to make worthwhile paintings, one was so involved in study always. A lot of other painters came back at the same time, so it was a very lively group, not by any means each one in agreement with the other, we had fantastic arguments about the why and wherefore of various theories. Everybody had to somehow earn their living, and it was rather a scramble but we did have a generous atmosphere amongst ourselves which perhaps doesnâ€™t exist in the same way today. When anybody did a good painting, whether you were a rival or not, or somebody was really not quite oneâ€™s friend, everybody went to look at the painting if everybody had come to the conclusion it was a very good painting. We regarded ourselves as a kind of brotherhood, sisterhood if you like, and watched each other with great attention and were glad when anybody got on better because it helped everybody else to get on better.\\n\\nOur friend Peter Bellew became art critic for the Sydney Morning Herald. I think then he had to do some naval work or other and could not go on with the art criticism so they asked my husband whether he would like to try his hand at writing art criticism for the paper. He immediately said, â€˜Oh, why donâ€™t you have my wife as art critic because she speaks the language and does writeâ€™, and the Herald said very charmingly and politely that they were not in the habit of employing women in this function as a critic, and couldnâ€™t contemplate the idea.",

                            "This confident and unflinching self portrait confirms accounts of Christine Audrey Pecketâ€™s strong will and her dedication in the face of considerable obstacles. Aged five when she contracted poliomyelitis, Pecket relied on braces and crutches, enduring years of painful orthopaedic treatments. Despite these challenges, Pecket was determined to become an artist. She completed a diploma at East Sydney Technical College, and her solo exhibition in 1937 included over 60 works. In a review of the exhibition in the _Sydney Morning Herald_, she said: â€˜Disabilities are supposed to take everything from life, to leave it hollow and empty. But they donâ€™t. They make you try all the harder. One makes up oneâ€™s mind to succeed despite the odds, and one does.â€™ After graduation Pecket established a studio in Castlereagh Street, Sydney, where she painted and offered tuition. Later she focused on pottery, producing a range of slip-cast decorative objects under the â€˜Christine Wareâ€™ label. In 1955 Pecket moved to Cammeray, where she built a studio and returned to painting, sculpting and teaching.",

                            "Dr Lowitja Oâ€™Donoghue AC CBE DSG (1932â€“2024), a Yankunytjatjara woman, dedicated her lifeâ€™s work to advancing the rights and wellbeing of Australiaâ€™s First Nations peoples. Born at Indulkana in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia, Oâ€™Donoghue was removed from her mother at the age of two and raised in a childrenâ€™s home. The first Aboriginal woman to complete nursing training at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, she travelled to remote communities, learning about her heritage through â€˜just doing what I could to heal peopleâ€™. Among her many achievements, she was Chair of the National Aboriginal Conference, Chair of the Aboriginal Development Commission and Chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, where she helped to draft the Mabo legislation. The Lowitja Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research was established in 2010, and in 2022 formed the Lowitja Oâ€™Donoghue Foundation to continue and preserve its patronâ€™s legacy. For her 2006 portrait by Robert Hannaford, Oâ€™Donoghue chose a red suit that she regularly wore for official occasions, along with jewellery proudly signifying her cultural heritage. Hannaford painted the portrait during several sessions at his studio in Adelaide, and says he aimed to capture his sitterâ€™s â€˜vast understanding and sympathyâ€™.",

But I quickly got to know him and respect him, and I knew that by the questioning and so on that he was really trying to find out more about me. So, Iâ€™m not sure that he knew much about [the] Stolen Generation. After I saw the portrait come out, I myself felt the portrait wasnâ€™t like me because Robert had told me very early in the piece that I wasnâ€™t to smile. He doesnâ€™t like smiling portraits. People who know me of course know that I do smile a lot.\\n\\nThe suit that I wore on the day, I think he was a bit surprised because it was really quite formal and itâ€™s a suit that I wear when I receive the many awards that Iâ€™ve received over the years. My family had no difficulty at all seeing me turn up in that same suit. And because it was a portrait, I thought, well, you know, Iâ€™m an Aboriginal woman and Iâ€™m going to wear the Aboriginal flag, and Iâ€™m going to wear everything red, black and yellow.\\n\\nIâ€™m much more proud of the fact that Iâ€™m a nurse and that I was able to use my nursing experience to actually travel to remote areas in my own, well in my own right, just doing what I could to heal people. I didnâ€™t know my people very well and so on, this is one way of getting to know them out on the APY lands. I have had a lot of senior jobs, met just so many people in high places, really. And I enjoyed seeing them but they werenâ€™t the most important things in my life. It was really about making a difference.",

                            "This portrait is of Lowitja O'Donoghue, Yankunjatjara woman and Indigenous rights campaigner. It was painted by Robert Hannaford in 2006 in oil on canvas. The work measures about 1.4 m tall by 1.4 m wide, set in its wide frame of dark wood. The portrait is painted realistically with loosely applied brushstrokes. Lowitja wears a bright red skirt-suit and is seated in front of a dark background.\\n\\nThe scene is lit from the top left. Lowitja is illuminated in a soft pool of light filling the top right and centre of the painting. Pale green-grey and blue-grey brush strokes at the top right curve around and down towards the bottom left, their direction changing, sweeping around and getting darker towards the lower edge of the canvas.\\n\\nLowitja sits on a dark wood chair in the centre of the image. The rounded corners of its back rise above each of her shoulders. Her head is tilted slightly down to her left with her chin angled up. Lowitjaâ€™s silvery hair is short, parted on the side, and styled in a wave over her forehead. Her skin is in warm honey tones and her cheeks are tinged pink. Lowitja has fine steeply-arched eyebrows above her dark eyes that gaze directly at us. Her nose is broad and deep grooves flow from it to the outer edges of her thin rosy lips. Her lips are closed and slightly downturned, creating soft jowels which frame her broad chin.\\n\\nIn the portrait Lowitja wears a loosley-fitted long jacket that runs down her lap to her knees. It has an Aboriginal Flag pin on the left lapel and is open, with three large round gold buttons gleaming brightly down its left side. A strand of black red and yellow beads and an oval shaped Aboriginal Flag pendant on a fine chain stand out against her black round-necked top.\\n\\nLowitjaâ€™s elbows rest lightly on the carved wooden arms of the chair and her hands lie with fingers extended in her lap. On the ring finger of her left hand she wears a wide yellow-gold band, while on her right a ring is set with a large black rectangular stone.\\n\\nLowitjaâ€™s red skirt extends over her knees and out of frame. The same red has been used by the artist to sign â€˜Hannaford 06â€™ on the bottom right of the canvas.\\n\\nAudio description written by Lucinda Shawcross and voiced by Amy Middleby",

                            "Grace Cossington Smith OBE is from the generation of women artists now largely credited with introducing modern art to Australia. Her painting _The sock knitter_ (1915), with its flattened picture plane, strong formal qualities and use of vivid colours, is considered the first post-impressionist painting exhibited in this country. During the 1920s Cossington Smith developed her distinctive mosaic-like style by which forms were translated into intricate, rhythmic squares and strokes of colour and light. In the same period she commenced her exhilarating series of paintings of the Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction. \\n\\nBy the time this 1948 self portrait was painted, Cossington Smith had moved from her garden studio at the family home in Sydneyâ€™s Turramurra to one inside the house, resulting in the shimmering paintings of interiors which are characteristic of her later work. Depicting herself in the prime of her long career, the short brushstrokes, laden with paint, build up a strong colour portrait and capture the dedication she felt towards her art in her intense focused gaze and the determined set of her lips.",

                            "My chief interest, I think, has always been colour, but not a flat crude colour, it must be colour within colour; it has to shine.\\n\\nI think my chief interest now is interiors. I used to be very fond of the bush but now I canâ€™t manage to go out in the bush.\\n\\nThe large painting which I have in the Wills art prize competition is an interior. Itâ€™s a room with a wardrobe and a bed and a carpet but the chief thing to me was the yellow walls, so that is why I call it _Interior in Yellow_. It was a very exciting thing to do. I wanted to express the forms in colour with the light because the whole thing is meant to express an interior with the light.\\n\\nI use squares in the way I paint, not from a conscious way but it came to me naturally because I feel in that way that light can be put into the colour. whereas just to put colour on to the surface in a flat way, I feel that it gives it a dead look.\\n\\nThe room is in my own home here and the sunlight did not come in in a definite way but the whole room seemed to be full of light, which is what I want to do more than the actual sunlight. I feel that even the shadows are a subdued light and they must have light in them as well as the light parts.",

                            "This self-portrait of the painter Grace Cossington Smith, was made in 1948, with oil on cardboard, and measures 57cm high and 48cm wide. The prominent frame is dark wood, and between it and the painting is a second, narrow, inner frame of bone coloured canvas.\\n\\nThe dynamism in this portrait comes from the way it has been painted - with small, squarish, paint-laden brush strokes in warm yellows and browns, that seem to flicker and move â€“ dancing across the surface of the canvas. In contrast, Grace appears rather quiet and unremarkable, looking out, through round rimmed glasses, and dressed in a collared shirt. \\n\\nGraceâ€™s head and upper torso dominate the portrait. Behind her, the top half of the painting shows a light filled, green and yellow dappled background, while the bottom half is mostly darker tones, and includes a warm, deep-brown coloured object â€“ possibly the back of a chair. \\n\\nGrace has cropped hair, parted at the centre, and tucked behind her ears. Though it is neat, there is the impression of a wavy texture - created through layered brush strokes in mottled copper-browns, yellow-greens and deep-blues. Graceâ€™s oval face is tilted slightly up, and the right side is angled to the viewer, with light falling on it. Her forehead is high, rounded and smooth. Graceâ€™s eyebrows are obscured by her slender, brown-framed, round-rimmed glasses. \\n\\nThrough the lenses, Graceâ€™s gaze is striking â€“ her eyes are brown and almond shaped, and their look is direct; unfaltering. Perhaps the intense stare is aimed at the viewer, or perhaps at herself, as she works on her portrait, scrutinising her reflection in a mirror.\\n\\nGrace has a straight nose. Her natural-pink lips are pursed, and set in a serious expression. \\n\\nA pink brush stroke defines the curve of Graceâ€™s small, round chin. Three brown flecks give shape to the right side of her jaw, and vertical, smudged dabs in yellow-brown and pink, allude to the slackening skin of the neck of a woman in her mid-fifties. \\n\\nThe collar of Graceâ€™s shirt fits close to her neck, and comes together in a â€˜vâ€™. On Graceâ€™s right side, where the light touches it, the front of her shirt is painted in whites, pale pinks and browns, while on her left side, deep reds and patches of dark blue-green indicate shadows. \\n\\nThe bottom edge of the portrait crops Grace off mid-chest. In the left corner, beneath the short sleeve of her shirt, is her bare right arm.\\n\\nIn front of Graceâ€™s left shoulder, in the lower right corner of the painting there are three flat, rectangular shaped objects layered against each other. The objectsâ€™ shapes and positions suggest they are the yellow backs of two cardboard canvasses leaning against a brown, timber easel.",

While still a student at the School of Fine Arts in Adelaide, Nora Heysen had work purchased by the state galleries of New South Wales and South Australia. She went to London in 1934, studying at the Central School of Art and the Byam Shaw School before returning to Australia and winning the 1938 Archibald Prize â€“ the first woman to do so. In 1943 she became the first woman appointed to work as an official war artist. While in New Guinea she met Dr Robert Black (1917â€“1988), who she married in Sydney in 1953. Professor of Tropical Medicine in the Commonwealth Institute of Health, University of Sydney from 1963 to 1982, his research and work with the World Health Organisation was instrumental in controlling malaria in the armed forces in Australia and in developing countries. This portrait was painted at their home in College Street, Sydney, and includes a view of the Port Jackson figs in Hyde Park, seen from their balcony.",

                            "This self portrait by artist, illustrator and cartoonist Percy Leason is characteristic of the Australian tonalist painting movement: a murky brown palette and a tonal stepping out of light and shade. Leason completed an apprenticeship as a lithographic artist in Melbourne, making illustrations for advertisements before turning to book illustration. He also attended night classes at the National Gallery School. After moving to Sydney in 1917, Leasonâ€™s paintings and etchings were purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales and he became a political cartoonist at the _Bulletin_. Perturbed by the â€˜new waveâ€™ of modernism sweeping Sydney, he returned to Melbourne in 1924, building a house in Eltham which became a hub for artists, writers and performers. Australiaâ€™s highest-paid cartoonist at that time, his political cartoons appeared in _Punch_, _Table Talk_ and the _Bulletin_. In 1938 Leason moved to the USA and settled in Staten Island, New York, where he established an art school, conducting art classes in realist tonal painting.",

                            "A painter, printmaker and sculptor, Rick Amor makes personal and emotionally charged works, often incorporating a haunting â€˜solitary watcherâ€™. Some of his paintings of suburban and inner Melbourne now number among the defining images of the city. In creating this portrait of author David Malouf AO (b. 1934), Amor says he aimed first, to produce a good likeness; and secondly, â€˜in a world full of enormous headsâ€™, a quiet picture of a diffident man of intellect. The modest scale of the portrait imparts a sense of intimacy and calm, offering a gentle portrayal of the sitter. Malouf is best known for his novels: _An imaginary life_ won the 1979 NSW Premierâ€™s Literary Award; _Fly away Peter_ was named the Age Book of the Year in 1982; _The great world_ won the Miles Franklin Award in 1990; _Remembering Babylon_ was shortlisted for the 1994 Booker Prize; and _The conversations at Curlow Creek_ was nominated for the Miles Franklin Award in 1997.",

                            "I think what Rick was looking for in the portrait was the person who is the writer. And the person who is the writer is not necessarily the person that presents themselves. So, he was looking behind the sociable gesture or the sociable person for, I think, the person who does the writing, who is often a quite secret self and mysterious and unknown even to the person who does the writing. That is, you know, the place the writing comes from is somewhere different from your social self.\\n\\nWhen youâ€™re a writer you have to discover how your own imagination works and how you can recreate on the page something that will stir the readerâ€™s imagination in the same way. Of course, because itâ€™s language thatâ€™s very, very much to do with rhythm and with cadence and things like that and I donâ€™t make a distinction between how important rhythm is in say poetry to how important it is in prose as well. And I think of almost everything I write, including the short stories or novels or even a piece of non-fictional prose, I think of that as being, when Iâ€™m writing it, as being something that will be read aloud, and read aloud in the readerâ€™s mind even if they donâ€™t think that thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re doing.\\n\\nI grew up in a generation where our visual imagination was absolutely stimulated and decided by film. And so almost always, I think, when Iâ€™m writing, I see whatâ€™s there as if it were either a still from a film or an unfolding piece of action in the film.",

                            "I think what Rick was looking for in the portrait was the person who is the writer, and the person who is the writer is not necessarily the person that presents themselves.\\n\\nWhen you are writing, you have to discover how your own imagination works and how you can recreate on the page something that will stir the reader's imagination in the same way. He chose to represent a person that he saw as being inward rather than expressing what's really going on there in some kind of outward or theatrical or flamboyant gesture.\\n\\nOf course, before the portrait was made, I knew Rick's work. I was little surprised that he was the person who wanted to do the portrait, because I didn't know the portraits very well. What I knew was his interest in spaces, so I was bit curious when he approached me about it. The work that I really knew his was much more abstract than that, not abstract in its texture but in its interest.\\n\\nMy chief memory of the sessions was really what were very interesting conversations, in which I just had to talk and he did the work while he talked. I understand that, because it's a way of making the conscious mind work in one way and the hand work in another. I understand that very well from what you do with writing.\\n\\nI didn't see the painting then until it was exhibited in Sydney which happened to be at Sherman's Gallery. I was surprised that it was smaller than I thought the picture had been that he was working on, and I was also very surprised by its quietness. Where it demands attention is that, if you are actually to see what's going on in it, you have to come quite close and you have to engage with it in a very quiet and personal way. That's the point at which you actually see that there's so much more going on, on that canvas.\\n\\nA sense of space is often something that is a cue to a feeling or to a perception that's they are somewhere buried and that you've got to allow to come up. The writer, for example, has to be unafraid of the emptiness of his mind, because out of that emptiness that something he doesn't yet know is going to come, so the space almost seems part of what is presented in the body and the face. There's that kind of emptiness in the background.\\n\\nIf you're looking for some of those clues that you get in conventional portraits of the social world or the social status or the interests of the sitter, those are deliberately taken away. He was looking behind the sociable gesture or the sociable person for, I think, the person who does the writing and he lets his inward vision work to create the portrait.",

Born at Cherbourg Aboriginal Reserve in Queensland, Blair began his career singing at local concerts while working on the cane fields. In March 1945 he sang on a radio talent quest, _Australiaâ€™s Amateur Hour_, gaining a record number of votes, and within months he was accepted by the Melbourne (Melba) Conservatorium of Music. He then studied at the Juilliard School in New York, performing in a benefit concert at the New York Town Hall in early 1951. Back in Australia, he appeared as a guest artist for the ABCâ€™s three-year Jubilee Tour of Australia and later taught at the Melba Conservatorium. Increasingly focused on First Nations rights, he served on the Aboriginesâ€™ Welfare Board in Victoria in the late 1950s, and was involved in the Aborigines Advancement League, the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the Commonwealth Aboriginal Arts Board. In 1973, he won praise for his performance in _Dalgerie_, the first ever opera staged at the Sydney Opera House.",

Heleâ€™s treatment of the paint, particularly to depict Buttfieldâ€™s luxurious fur coat and poised demeanour, combined with the warm palette, captures her strength but also reveals an alluring quality. \\n\\nThe daughter of car industry pioneer Sir Edward Holden, Buttfieldâ€™s interest in politics was encouraged by her father, a state parliamentarian, and family friend Robert Menzies. In 1954, she was endorsed as the Liberal Party candidate for Adelaide, unsuccessfully contesting the seat in the federal election that year. When a senate seat fell vacant in 1955, she was elected to parliament as a Liberal senator for South Australia, serving from 1955â€“65 and again from 1968â€“74, where she lobbied on issues such as equal pay for women. She was the first female senator to visit the Soviet Union and toured China alone in 1962. After her retirement she served on many boards and made philanthropic contributions to youth and the arts.",

                            "Conway Hart arrived in Melbourne in 1850 and worked there and in Geelong before relocating to Hobart in early 1855. An August 1856 review of his Liverpool Street â€˜Portrait Galleryâ€™ stated that â€˜the portraits issuing from this studio excel anything witnessed before in this colonyâ€™. Like many successful colonists in Hobart, William Robertson senior commissioned several local artists to record his family, including this portrait of his son William Robertson (1839â€“1892). Robertson senior had emigrated to Van Diemenâ€™s Land in 1824 and in the mid-1830s invested in a scheme to expand pastoral activities to Port Phillip. He eventually moved his family to an estate near Colac, called The Hill, building it into one of Victoriaâ€™s leading cattle studs. William Robertson junior, a lawyer and politician, inherited the Colac property on his fatherâ€™s death in 1874; two years later he retired as a barrister and with his three brothers focused on the management of the family properties. He was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly in the 1870s and 1880s.",

                            "Louis Kahanâ€™s distinguished career as an artist spanned much of the 20th century. Born in Vienna, Kahan settled in Melbourne in 1947 and soon established a reputation for his painted portraits. By the early 1960s he had become recognised for his expressive portrait drawings, in which the distinctive features and characters of his sitters were captured with energy and economy. \\n\\nThis painting of art critic, writer and producer Robert Hughes AO (1938â€“2012) as an intense intellectual seems to prefigure the reputation for hauteur and boorishness Hughes subsequently acquired. One of Australiaâ€™s famous expatriates of the 1960s, he settled in London in 1964, writing for _The Times_, _The Spectator_, _The Observer_ and _Oz_, and publishing his book _The Art of Australia_ (1966). Appointed art critic for _Time_ magazine, he moved to New York in 1970 and lived in the USA for the rest of his life. Hughes is perhaps best known for his television series _The Shock of the New_ (1980), which introduced modern art to a mass audience.",

                            "Artist Stella Bowen moved from Adelaide to London in 1913, where she enrolled at the Westminster School of Art and soon became part of a circle of artists, writers and intellectuals. She met the English novelist Ford Madox Ford in 1917 and their daughter Julia was born in 1920. Bowen essentially gave up painting, with her daughter (and Fordâ€™s career as a writer) becoming the focus. After the couple separated in 1928, Bowen became dependent on her painting for an income. She travelled to the USA in 1932, completing several portrait commissions before returning to Europe and eking out a living with painting, reviewing and teaching in England and France. \\n\\nThis self-reflective work, painted when Bowen was in her 40s, projects undemonstrative confidence. Bowenâ€™s palette is soft and light, finding the earthy and muted tones she had loved when she travelled to Italy in 1923 and encountered the work of 14th-century Italian artists such as Giotto. Her ongoing fascination with Giottoâ€™s technique is evident in the thin layering of pigment. The green blouse is so briefly articulated; the overall form, collar and loose ties drawn in with the lightest dry brush over pencil lines. Bowen uses a sketchy, painterly style with fine scratches adding texture and dimension to the work.",

                            "Painter and printmaker David Strachan is best known for his mining landscapes, figurative works and still lifes. He trained at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, the AcadÃ©mie de la Grand ChaumiÃ¨re in Paris and George Bellâ€™s school in Melbourne before moving to Sydney in 1941. There he studied at East Sydney Technical College, where he met Margaret Olley, who became a lifelong friend. Strachan was one of the group of artists who travelled regularly to the abandoned NSW mining town of Hill End, and during the war he worked as a camouflage painter at Bankstown aerodrome with other artists such as William Dobell. His first solo exhibition, held at the Macquarie Galleries in 1944, included this poetic self portrait, which demonstrates his recurring fascination with flowers and angelic figures emerging out of darkness. In the 1960s, following a decade living in Paris and London, Strachan taught at East Sydney Tech and exhibited regularly, winning the Wynne Prize for landscape painting in 1961 and 1964.",

                            "Artist, writer and teacher Herbert Badham specialised in figurative paintings of urban life. Having studied for many years at the Julian Ashton School during the 1920s and 1930s, he produced a body of work that typified the gentle, realist aspect of Sydney modernism of the prewar years. Head of the intermediate art department at East Sydney Technical College from 1938 to 1961, he published _Study of Australian Art_ in 1949 and _A Gallery of Australian Art_ in 1954. In this small-scale self portrait set in a domestic interior, Badham sits facing the viewer with a pipe held between his lips while he pulls on a brown leather glove. A mirror hanging on the wall behind him introduces his companion, possibly his wife Enid, who appeared in another self portrait from 1937.",

                            "With a brilliant note of crimson, Adelaide Perry accentuates the lips of her former student, artist, conservationist and educator Rachel Roxburgh (1915â€“1991). Having exhibited at the 1922 Salon in Paris while undertaking studies at the Royal Academy in London, Perry had returned to Sydney in 1925 where she opened her own art school and became a founding member of the Australian Academy of Art. Known for her modernist landscapes and prints, Perry also painted many portraits of her female friends. Here Roxburgh wears a soft cream blouse with mother of pearl buttons and delicate floral motif, which is set against the strong verticals of a striped wallpaper. Her gaze is steady, yet not quite looking at us. At the time, Roxburgh was exhibiting her work with the Contemporary Group, Society of Artists and at the Macquarie Galleries. During the Second World War she qualified as a nurse at Sydney Hospital, before spending a decade in London, studying at the Central and Hammersmith art schools. Also a conservationist and heritage campaigner, Roxburgh later served on the executive of the National Trust (NSW) and contributed to the identification and classification of colonial architectural heritage.",

                            "A portrait of the artist, educator and conservationist, Rachel Roxburgh by Adelaide Perry. \\n\\nA framed oil painting on canvas, created in 1939, it measures 77 cm high and 67 cm wide. \\n\\nThe frame is a dull gold with a pale grey wash painted over the gold in sections in clear brushstrokes. The corners are raised and decorated in a foliage design. \\n\\nThe portraitâ€™s strong, striped background in cool colours contrasts with a sensitive depiction of the figure of Rachel Roxburgh. Seated on a settee, rendered in warm peaches and creams Rachelâ€™s image is cropped at the bust, filling the majority of the canvas.\\n\\nThe background is a vertical repeating design of thick taupe, teal and almost-black lines. An unseen object casts a faint shadow behind her right shoulder. Just the curve of a reddish-brown high-backed settee is partially shown behind her left shoulder. \\n\\nHer brunette hair is pulled off her face, elegantly piled on her head in a loose rolled wave, revealing her ears. She has a high forehead with lightly arched brown brows and deep hooded round, light green eyes.\\n\\nShe gazes intently outwards over our right shoulder. Her complexion is creamy, with her nose and cheeks a blushing peach. Her full lips are coated in a vivid coral lipstick. Her chin and jawline are softly rounded and also flushed pink. The arch of her eyebrows and slight upturn of the upper lip makes her appear thoughtful.  \\n  \\nRachel wears a cream pussy-bow blouse with an understated white floral design and a line of greyish buttons. Puff sleeves stop midway down her upper arm, emphasising her broad shoulders. On the garment, taupe and dusky pink shadows emphasise the loosely draping neckline and the trail of buttons down her front. \\n\\nA signature in bright red is painted in the bottom right, A. E. Perry, 39.",

                            "Although Arthur Boyd AC OBE is widely recognised for his landscapes and mythical subjects, and produced relatively few portraits, he made a number of paintings of family and friends, all redolent of his interest in deep human truths. In the background of this portrait of Carl Cooper (1912â€“1966), under a lowering sky, appear motifs characteristic of Boydâ€™s work: a flying creature and denuded trees. This psychologically intense painting conveys Cooperâ€™s deep mental and physical discomfort.\\n\\nCooper studied at the East Sydney Technical College and the Royal College of Art in London. He contracted poliomyelitis in his twenties and lost the use of his legs. In hospital he met the artist John Perceval, who introduced him to the Boyd family. Arthur Merric Boyd and Perceval had opened the AMB pottery near the Boyd family home in Murrumbeena, just outside Melbourne, in the mid-1940s, where Cooper began making incised earthenware pieces. Arthur Boyd recollected Cooper as a â€˜dissatisfied, fierce, crushedâ€™ figure, a sentiment he has captured in this portrait. Cooper eventually set up his own studio, but illness forced him to cease production in 1963.",

                            "Sir William Dobell studied art in Sydney before leaving for Europe in 1929. On his return to Australia after a decade he managed to impress both conservative and modernist art factions with his powerful, expressive paintings. He won the Archibald Prize three times, although his first win, for his painting of Joshua Smith, was challenged by claims that it was a caricature, not a portrait. The court eventually found in Dobellâ€™s favour.\\n\\nA friend and patron of Dobell, Sir Charles Lloyd Jones â€“ the grandson of the original David Jones, who founded the department store in Sydney in 1838 â€“ commissioned the artist to paint several family portraits, including this one of his eldest son David Lloyd Jones (1931â€“1961). Charles Lloyd Jones was chairman of David Jones Ltd from 1920 until his death in 1958. David was 17 when his father began preparing him as his successor. In 1954, aged 23, he became the youngest director of David Jones in the firmâ€™s history. Following his fatherâ€™s death he became Deputy Chairman and joint Managing Director of David Jones Ltd; in 1960, he was appointed Chairman. A year later he died, aged 30, within weeks of being diagnosed with cancer.",

                            "Royal Academy-trained artist Reginald Jerrold-Nathan was an established portrait painter before moving from London to Sydney in 1924. In this portrait of his friend, feminist and activist Lady Jessie Street (1889â€“1970), Jerrold-Nathanâ€™s fondness for depicting women in rich fabrics, furs and jewels can be seen; Street wears a velvet brocade jacket and jade necklace, despite her preference for a suit and comfortable shoes. In Streetâ€™s posture and firm gaze, Jerrold-Nathan has suggested her warmth as well as her resolve and resilience. \\n\\nStreetâ€™s 50-year career encompassed achievements on landmark issues such as family planning, equal pay and equal employment. In the interwar years she advocated for unemployment relief, the plight of Jewish refugees and the rights of First Nations peoples. In 1945, she was the sole Australian woman delegate to the founding of the United Nations. Her husband, Sir Kenneth Street, was Chief Justice of NSW from 1950, and for much of the 1950s she worked for the World Peace Council in London.

                            "I donâ€™t think weâ€™ve got any high-ranking women in any trade union, which is a shocking thing. After all, the trade union movement is supposed to represent both the men and the women in jobs. There must be amongst their membership, the same number of intelligent women as there are intelligent men. And I would very much hope to see in the future â€“ I donâ€™t suppose itâ€™ll come in my lifetime â€“ that they have the proper distribution of places of influence between men and women both in the governing bodies of unions, and also, later on, when things gets more socialistic, in the governing body of the industries themselves.\\n\\nNow I say, â€˜get more socialisticâ€™, there because many years ago I became a socialist. I read quite a lot of books about politics and so on and so forth, and it seemed to me to be the system under which the individual, whether a man or a woman, had the greatest opportunity of developing their usefulness and status. You only have to look back in history in the days of serfdom and all the rest of it. Itâ€™s as theyâ€™ve gradually overcome the limitations that were placed on them by the social system, that not only women have advanced but society itself has advanced. And of course, if you come to think of it, men and women are both components of society and if you have a horse with a lame foot or a shackled foot itâ€™s not going to gallop was well as one that hasnâ€™t got, who hasnâ€™t got any shackles on. And itâ€™s the same with the human race â€“ if youâ€™re going to shackle the women, as they have been in the past and to a certain extent still are, youâ€™re going to hold up the progress of the whole of our society.",

                            "When Helena Rubinstein (1872â€“1965) sat for British artist Graham Sutherland, she wore a gown by fashion designer CristÃ³bal Balenciaga, which Sutherland thought made her look like an empress. To render the colour and texture exactly, he cut a sample of fabric from the hem of the dress. The artist made three paintings of her; she acquired this one for herself and displayed it at her home in New York City. \\n\\nRubinstein started one of the worldâ€™s first global cosmetic companies, Helena Rubinstein, in Melbourne in 1902, after moving to Australia from Poland in 1896. Her first beauty salon specialised in a product said to contain rare herbs from eastern Europe, but which was made with lanolin from local sheep fleeces, â€˜vegetable oil, mineral oil and waxâ€™. From 1908 she opened salons in London, Paris and New York. Other stand-alone and department store salons followed. Integral to Rubinsteinâ€™s success was her awareness that she was the most effective ambassador for the brand. Her wardrobe, consequently, included gowns by the most illustrious designers. In her 1964 memoir, Rubinstein described Sutherlandâ€™s portraits as â€˜incredibly bold, domineering interpretations of what I had never imagined I looked likeâ€™, but conceded that â€˜as paintings they were indeed masterpiecesâ€™.",

                            "This is an oil on canvas portrait of Helena Rubinstein â€“ entrepreneur and founder of her own global cosmetics corporation. \\n\\nThe gold-and-cream framed work, is approx. 2m high and 1m wide, showing a view of Helena from head to below her knees. Helena is seated, her head held high, a mature woman exuding glamour and style wearing a sumptuous, ruby-red gown juxtaposed against a dove grey background. \\n\\nHelena Rubensteinâ€™s body is turned slightly, her left side more prominently displayed and she gazes out of the portrait to her right, looking rather tense. Her mid-length black hair is pulled tightly back, her sleek up-do highlights her high forehead and clearly visible grey hairs just above her left ear. Her thick hair is tied at her nape, soft curls gather in a black ribbon hugging the back of her neck.\\n\\nFurrows mark the commencement of an arch to each small, well-kept eyebrow. There are creases in the soft skin around her dark eye on the left side of her face. Here, her complexion is smooth and liberally dusted with pink blusher. She has wide nostrils and a prominent nose casting a thin shadow onto her (barely visible) right cheek. \\n\\nHelenaâ€™s olive skin shows signs of age at the corners of her thin, ruby-red mouth and noticeably defined jowl. A patch of shadow accentuates the soft, vertical folds in the paper-thin skin of her neck. \\n\\nShe has large ears and creases nose to mouth-corners. She holds herself rigid, ill-at-ease, maintaining proud posture and staring beyond us. \\n\\nHer face is made up and black/brown lines outline neat eyebrows, her eyelids and eye lashes. Her nose and chin tilt upwards. Her thin lips are closed and brightly outlined in red. \\n\\nOn her left ear is a large tear-drop shaped earring encrusted with pearls and diamonds. A sumptuous 5-stringed pearl necklace caresses her neck and the lower strands rest on the material of her dress. \\n\\nTwo large oval shaped rings adorn both stiffly crossed hands resting on her lap. Her left hand holds a 5cm gold, leaf-shaped object.\\n\\nHelenaâ€™s rich, ruby-red brocade gown by designer Balenciago bears a detailed floral pattern in shades of gold, white, light blues and greens. The bodice has a high neckline, three-quarter sleeves and flairs out over the skirt at hip level. Helenaâ€™s full skirt drapes loosely around her hips and upper legs, occupying the whole lower quarter of the portrait.  \\n  \\nThe dressâ€™s floral pattern becomes less and less defined towards the bottom edge of the portrait, disseminating to smudged shades of paler reds, orange and pinks as it continues to flow from the seated woman out beyond the bottom edge of the picture frame.\\n\\nThe artist â€“ Graham Sutherland has signed his work in the bottom right corner of the canvas.",

                            "Artist Howard Arkley and musician and writer Nick Cave AO (b. 1957) moved in the same creative circles in Melbourne in the 1970s. Cave formed his first band, eventually named The Boys Next Door, when he was a student. After leaving school the band became embedded in Melbourneâ€™s post-punk and alternative music scenes, renaming themselves The Birthday Party when they relocated to London. Based on photos, posters and clippings, this portrait was made in Arkleyâ€™s Melbourne studio in 1999, when Cave was the frontman for Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. The result is a portrait that evokes the material culture of the underground music scene, as well as the emotional intensity of Caveâ€™s writing and music. Its pulsating colour coveys the noise and lurid stage lighting of the venues where Cave made his start. It is an unmistakeable example of Arkleyâ€™s work and a distillation of the many stylistic and technical threads that run through it â€“ from the abstract compositions of his early career to the airbrush paintings of suburban homes and interiors for which he is best known.",

                            "A portrait of the musician, Nick Cave, by Howard Arkley, created in 1999. Acrylic paint on stretched canvas, unframed, measuring 175cm high and 135cm wide.\\n\\nThe image undulates with flowing lines that define the contours of his face, creating organic shapes. It is painted in clashing colours that pulse alongside one another, creating a fluid yet graphic quality. The edges of these shapes are hazy having been outlined with an airbrush. The background is revealed in the lower left corner and is painted a matt teal.\\n\\nHis face fills the canvas and is cropped at the neck. His head is turned towards us with his left ear visible, the right ear remaining out of view. \\n\\nHis hair, cut off by the edge of the painting is disheveled and wavy. The tendrils of hair are reminiscent of seaweed and painted in thick locks of different shades of blue and purple, outlined in deep indigo. It tumbles down surrounding his long face, tucked behind his left ear and curling at the ends to rest around his neck. \\n\\nThe shape of his face is described in five solid colours that are painted in a combination of competing cool and warm tones. His forehead and cheekbone are the highest points, painted white, with the lower planes of his face shaded in purple and a deep fuchsia with peach and neon yellow in between. His left ear is painted in the same manner, highlighted in pops of the same colours. \\n\\nDeep-set eyes are shadowed in purple and fuchsia, exaggerating and defining the eye sockets. A crescent stroke of deep blue is painted beneath both eyes. The exception to the indistinct airbrushed lines is a source of light reflected in the iris of both eyes, detailed by sharp edged white marks. These hard edges draw attention, enhancing the intensity of his aloof gaze that conflicts with the brightness of the painting.\\n\\nHis nose sweeps down from his right eye in curling lines and shapes of peach, white and pink. A shadow beneath his nose connects to his top lip. His mouth is closed in a resting position with pouty pink lips. \\n\\nHis curved jawline casts a shadow onto his creamy white neck. The contrast of his stark neck against his vivid face give the impression he is wearing a mask, adding a sense of theatre and glamour to the work.",

The whole world stopped for Howard Arkley.\\n\\nWell, I think from Howardâ€™s exuberance and personality a lot of people got inspired. Howard grew up in suburbia. Howard was involved with suburbia. Howard lived in suburbia, Howardâ€™s studios later on were in suburbia, and Howard would have seen suburbia day-in day-out as being the major reality of Australia.\\n\\nI have only just started painting suburban paintings in a pixellated style. Iâ€™ve done a few suburban paintings in a sort of traditional classic style, but I havenâ€™t really shown them to anyone. We look at his work as being dominated by line, but one of the interesting things about that line is that itâ€™s actually not a line at all, itâ€™s a spray, and itâ€™s more like an atomised abstraction.\\n\\nWhen I look at that painting I see both Howard Arkley and Nick Cave, and also I do see an anonymous masklike figure that can represent a generation of that punk 80â€™s mentality. Itâ€™s a lot of attitude in that painting, and that attitude comes from both the sitter and the painter.",

                            "Ken Done AM was a successful advertising graphic designer before giving up work to paint full-time in 1980. He opened his first shop in Sydneyâ€™s The Rocks two years later, selling his stylised, colourful representations of Sydneyâ€™s beaches, harbour, animals and flowers on everything from T-shirts to bedlinen. Doneâ€™s art evolved in parallel with his merchandise, and he has featured in more than 100 solo exhibitions. Done has painted several portraits, including this one of Pritzker Prize-winning Australian architect Glenn Murcutt AO (b. 1936), who designed Doneâ€™s house in Mosman in 1990. Keen for the portrait to accord with the personal style of his khaki-clad sitter, the artist kept the work very simple. The details of Murcuttâ€™s face are reduced to lidless and browless eyes, nose and lips; the harbour is reflected in his signature half spectacles. Done says wryly that the top of his subjectâ€™s head reminds him of the curve of a typical Murcutt roof. Floating in the blue sky are decorative motifs that sit beneath the architectâ€™s name like golden medallions in the shape of the sun and moon.",

                            "For me in architecture nature has a beautiful story. You look at the strength of our flora but also look at the delicacy at the same time. So thereâ€™s a strength and a delicacy. I love the idea of the legibility of the strength. I love the delicacy of the edges. And so in my work, I like to articulate that which is structure, that which is skin, that which is edge. These are things that are in nature in this part of the world and I have endeavoured in my career to try and understand this landscape of ours and be able to integrate these elements not in a determined way but in a very relaxed way. So that there is the articulation of elements without it being such that you are forced to look at it. I donâ€™t like an architecture that is saying to me, Look at me, look at me, look at me. I want an architecture thatâ€™s quiet, that reveals itself quietly, and the more you start to see it, the more you start to understand it.\\n\\nThe roots of architecture remain relevant. If you go beyond the roots of architecture, about space, about order, about structure, about understanding nature and structure â€¦ If you go and just do something for the sake of it, for example, youâ€™ll hear students talking about, Oh I wanted to do this and I wanted to do that. Thatâ€™s delinquent. What does the brief call for? What does the site call for? What does the economics call for? What does the structure call for, what are the materials available? These are the things â€“ itâ€™s not what I want. Itâ€™s what these things are asking to be addressed.\\n\\nI am very happy at the age of over 80 now still practising like mad and still enjoying it as I did as a young architect.",

                            "My family lived in New Guinea, and we had to leave very quickly at the outbreak of the second world war - the Japanese were already bombing Port Moresby. And my father had invested in waterfront property around Sydney Harbour. It was so important to him to see the beauty of the landscape of Sydney Harbour. And as children we were taught to respect nature, but not just to respect it, to love it. When you look at nature, and for me in architecture, nature has a beautiful story. You look at the strength or our flora, but also look at the delicacy at the same time. So there is a strength and a delicacy.\\n\\nI have endeavoured in my career to try and understand this landscape of ours and be able to integrate these elements, not in a determined way, but in a very relaxed way. I want an architecture that is quiet, and the more you start to see it, the more you start to understand it.\\n\\nThe roots of architecture remain relevant. If you go beyond the roots of architecture, about space, about order, about structure, about understanding nature and structure. So there is cultural history, there is typology, there is morphology, there is materiality, then there is the understanding of the topography. So your going to get buildings going up a hill like this in a higher density area, or moving like this down a hill. These are the sort of things that you are dealing with. And in portraiture there has got to be that centre of interest, a balance. A balance that has got to be light, a quality of light, depending upon whether there is required transparency or solidity. These are the sort of things we as architects work in a certain way. Painters like Done work in another way.\\n\\nKen Done has known me for a long time, and he observes the minimal nature of a form and tries in a very economic way to describe that form in a single line. For me that is very much the way I work, because I am also looking at a very economic way of developing spaces.\\n\\nFor the 45 years I have been in practice, it has been a sole practice without staff.Â  I have recognised that if I want the standard and the level that I want to achieve, then I can do it rather quickly. I don't want to have to deal with personality clashes in practices. I don't want to have to deal with having to chase money. I don't want to have to deal with all those other dreadful aspects. I realised that I could get through an enormous amount if I was dedicated. If the work is bad it is my responsibility, if it comes off well, thank goodness, it is very pleasing. And so I was minimising the risk of doing terrible things. I am very happy at the age of over 80 now, still practicing like mad, and still enjoying it as I did as a young architect.",

                            "- I like to make pictures. I've made a few sculptures, I've made a little bit of pottery, but basically I'm a painter. I'm not complaining, but I've had to overcome a lot of early success in the sense that the early things that people saw were very commercial things. I was 40 when I had my first exhibition. It's quite old, really. But, that's just the way it was for me.\\n\\nIf you like visual things, you know, that's what you like, you like all kinds of things and the only criteria should be, was it any good? You know, do you like it? I am very Sydney. I live beside Sydney Harbour which is a fantastic place to be. I kayak on the harbour, I feed the fish, I don't like to catch them anymore. I feed them, in fact, if anybody comes down here and they say, is there any fish around? I say, oh, no, there's no fish around here. No fish around here. But of course there are, top of the tide, there's eight big bream, I almost know them by name, come around each morning. There's parts of the harbour close by here, where we live, that hasn't changed forever. No houses, look exactly the same as when aboriginal people lived here or even later when Captain Cook came through. That's one of the great things about Sydney, I think, is that they've still preserved that natural landscape in some parts. Such a beautiful place. Almost inevitably you'll make pictures that try to be beautiful. You can't be as beautiful as itself, you can never be as beautiful as nature, you can not. But all you can do is to use that environment to lead you to make a painting that somehow might have the feeling of it.\\n\\nIt's a complicated picture and it clearly set out to show that there's a kind of public face that I have. That's most of the time smiling and most of the time optimistic. But there's another face, maybe another even two faces within there that I hope shows a sadder side or a different kind of sensitivity. Glenn designed a house for us. We've known him a long time, he's a lovely man. And I did make a small drawing, but I wanted to make the painting as simple and as elegant as one of his buildings. I love the fact that in the portrait gallery, you've sometimes shown them both together and it just shows his elegant simplicity against the kind of complication of my self portrait which, you know, I would say straight to the psychiatrist, looking at that painting.",

                            "Artist Charles Blackman OBE is perhaps best known for his series of paintings, prints and drawings incorporating characters and motifs from _Alice in Wonderland_. The figure of Alice was inspired by his wife, poet, writer and philanthropist Barbara Blackman AO (1928â€“2024). Just 15 when the ABC Weekly published one of her poems, Barbara became a member of Brisbaneâ€™s literary circle, joining the Barjai writersâ€™ collective where she met the poet Judith Wright (1915â€“2000), who she is depicted with here. Wright had been experiencing hearing loss since her midtwenties, while Barbara had begun to lose her sight and was declared blind by the age of 22. Barbara later wrote: â€˜She of the faraway voice and I of the faraway face did not find our lacks obstructive to the deepening roots of friendship.â€™ This double portrait dates from a period in Charles Blackmanâ€™s career when he had to economise on materials, and is executed in thin layers of oil paint, leaving the paper bare on the faces and skin. Barbara, in profile at the right-hand side of the composition, recalled that the hat she is shown wearing belonged to Wright. Her hand is spread protectively over her friendâ€™s ear.",

                                "It was in many ways a very unlikely marriage, for a person near-blind or going blind to marry someone whose whole world was a visual world and who was so creative in that visual world. But somehow what his creations came out of â€“ a sort of a living or understanding of poetry â€“ was something that always bound us and still binds us together. But at that time when I recognised Charles as potentially a very great painter and a great creator, I relinquished my strong intentions of being a writer and although I went on writing diaries and sometimes poems and more and more I became a very prolific letter-writer as I gathered more and more interesting people as friends and we became more and more separated by distance, my writing changed course, as in fact my life had changed course to become devoted to Charlesâ€™ optimal putting forward of himself as a painter.\\n\\nYou know, when we married I said, â€˜Well if youâ€™re going to be a painter, youâ€™re going to paint, youâ€™re not going to go out and get a job doing something or another,â€™ so he stayed home and painted. And by this time my eyesight had failed almost altogether and I was on a blind pension, so we had that as a basis to live on. And the only thing I could really do was to work as an artistâ€™s model, as a nude model, which in fact I quite enjoyed because I was picking up a lot of information about painting. Itâ€™s quite an elegant job in its way, being a model, because one can decide oneâ€™s own poses and itâ€™s a very private occupation. One can have oneâ€™s own thoughts and one has the satisfaction of knowing oneâ€™s doing a job well.",

                                "The portrait shows Judith Wright; poet, literary critic, editor, and fiction writer, with her friend Barbara Blackman; poet, writer, and philanthropist. The portrait is oriented horizontally, and measures approximately 115cm tall by 150cm wide including its unusual 10 cm frame. This is a complex work of bright colours, unusual shapes and bold textures\\n\\nThe wooden frame is like a series of concentric frames within frames, of varying widths and colours, painted to resemble different metals. On the outermost edge of the frame antique gold-leaf that has darkened and rubbed off in patches. Inside this, a wide band, painted green like the patina on weathered copper. The next band is narrower, the distressed, gold-leaf pattern is repeated. The band of frame closest to the painting is very thin and gleams pink like polished copper.\\n\\nThe background of the portrait is sky-blue. Judith and Barbaraâ€™s heads and torsos fill most of the space. The womenâ€™s faces are in profile, Judith on the left, Barbara on the right. The friends are connected by their gaze as they look at each other, their arms which reach across, and their upper bodies that seem to merge towards the bottom of the portrait. \\n\\nThe figures are not â€˜life likeâ€™. Judith and Barbaraâ€™s silhouetted profiles are simplified and exaggerated in an almost cartoon like way. This simplicity, the defined line between their forms, together with the blue background gives the women the quality of collage paper cut-outs.\\n\\nA limited colour palette of blue, red, yellow, white, and black has been chosen, and is blended in places to create green, purple, lighter and darker shades., Paint has been applied unevenly, with some thick streaks of colour, some areas washed with diluted colour, and other patches of the brown paper left bare.\\n\\nJudith is slightly shorter. Her face turns towards her friend. Judithâ€™s silhouette is simplified and geometric. A tall rectangle with triangular nose jutting out. She has a cropped red fringe, her eye, which slants down at the outer edge and seems to look up towards her friend, is a red outline and smudges of blue on the eyelids and iris. Judithâ€™s cheek is a pink blur and the rest of her skin is the warm beige of the paper. Her cheek has been accentuated by a patch of translucent white. Judithâ€™s lips have a purple-grey hue, and turn down, following the same angle as her eye. The rest of her hair - in blue, green, and red - falls straight down, ending in a blunt line level with her chin. Her hair is irregular vertical dashes, except at the ends, which are round dabs. Barbaraâ€™s large hand protectively cups the back of Judithâ€™s head with her splayed fingers.\\n\\nJudithâ€™s torso faces forward. She is wearing a V-neck, sleeveless garment in blue-grey, on it, thick brush strokes roughly repeat itâ€™s shape getting smaller and smaller. Judithâ€™s left hand is emerging to clasp Barbaraâ€™s left shoulder. \\n\\nBetween the two figures the women seem to merge; at Judithâ€™s forehead and Barbaraâ€™s hat brim; where Barbaraâ€™s arm extends out and across to her friend, and at the bottom where their bodies blend together, shoulder to breast. Blue space between them is emphasised by darker shading around the womenâ€™s profiles.\\n\\nBarbara Blackman wears a hat with a low crown and wide brim, it casts a shadow over her brow. Barbaraâ€™s hair falls straight then flicks out slightly where it ends in line with her bottom lip. The shape of her hair is outlined in feathery black- blue brush strokes and filled in with soft, vertical smudges of deep-blue, rust-red, pale-blue and yellow. \\n\\nThe women are both in profile, Barbaraâ€™s head is wider at her forehead than her chin. Her broad nose extends down in a vertical line from her hat brim, her chin receding. Her eye, which meets Judithâ€™s, has its upper eyelid delineated in black; a dark black and blue iris, a thick blue smudge for the lower lid.

Her lips are two lines of rich red that turn up gently at the edge.\\n\\nBarbara wears a light grey, round-necked, long sleeved garment.

                            "Painter and printmaker David Strachan studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, the AcadÃ©mie de la Grand ChaumiÃ¨re in Paris, and at George Bellâ€™s school in Melbourne. Known for his starkly elegant landscapes, figurative works and still lifes, Strachan spent much of his working life in Europe, establishing a business in Paris that published etchings and lithographs by leading artists. Returning to Australia in 1960, he taught printmaking at East Sydney Technical College and won the Wynne Prize in 1961 and 1964. Strachanâ€™s portrait of Kenneth Rowell AM (1920â€“1999) positions the sitter against a yellow background, bathed in golden light. An artist and theatre designer, Melbourne-born Rowell began designing backdrops and costumes during the early 1940s, earning his first professional commission in 1947. He moved to London in 1950, subsequently working between the United Kingdom and Australia over the next four decades on more than 140 ballet, opera and theatre productions. At the same time, he developed a considerable reputation as an artist, producing expressionist paintings, mixed media works and sculpture inspired by the Australian landscape.",

                            "Early on, at the beginning of my career, I really wasnâ€™t interested in painting at all. Quite simply I was stagestruck and for a long time thatâ€™s really all I wanted to do, I just wanted to work in the theatre, I was mad about the theatre. That seemed enough for a few years, or perhaps for ten years, and then I became terribly conscious of the fact that I was working in a medium that you can never be wholly in charge of as a designer or a producer or a choreographer; youâ€™re one of a number of collaborators working together on a production. And I became more and more interested in the idea of painting because that seemed to me to be something where I could be in charge of a medium and express myself in a way that, much as I love working in the theatre, I would never have that final control about what the statement was. So I started to try and paint and I worked terribly hard. I took myself out of the theatre because I could see that the only way of developing a technique and trying to find a direction as a painter was really to get right out of the theatre for a few years. I did that, and people in the English theatre thought I was mad, but I felt it was something I absolutely had to do.\\n\\nThe paintings I did for the first few years were really not good at all. But I worked very hard, I developed a technique. I simply work in the theatre when Iâ€™m offered work that I want to do and when Iâ€™m not doing that, Iâ€™m up in the studio painting for all Iâ€™m worth.\\n\\nI know that this work I do as a painter nourishes all my theatre work, the colours even that Iâ€™ve used in the _Sleeping Beauty_ which are very â€“ particularly in the prologue and scenes like that â€“ absolutely strong, chromatic colours I know I donâ€™t see in other theatre. I can only use these because of all Iâ€™ve learned as a painter. Anyway, the thing is that both forms of activity now are absolutely necessary to me. People donâ€™t particularly want you to work in two different media but itâ€™s something that I absolutely need.",

                            "Louise Hearmanâ€™s paintings display her command of light and shadow, and often express a sense of transience. In her portrait of violinist, conductor and composer Richard Tognetti AO (b. 1965), her subject appears to float in an abstract field of colour. As Hearman noted of the portrait: â€˜How do you condense a brilliant frenetic being, who unfolds in time, into a single image that exists in the present? Richard is a field of energy and I have tried to nail down particles that look like they belong to him.â€™ Tognetti trained with famed violinists William Primrose and Alice Waten in Australia before undertaking further studies with Igor Ozim at the Bern Conservatory in Switzerland, where he was awarded the Tschumi Prize for outstanding graduate soloist. He returned home in 1989 to lead the Australian Chamber Orchestra and was appointed the Artistic Director and Lead Violin later that year. As director or soloist, Tognetti has appeared with many of the worldâ€™s leading orchestras, and has co-composed scores for feature films, notably Peter Weirâ€™s 2003 _Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World_ (for which he also coached Russell Crowe for his onscreen violin playing).",

                            "Neale Daniher AO (b. 1961), former Australian rules footballer and coach, grew up in Ungarie, New South Wales, and was signed to play for Essendon in the VFL in 1979. After ten injury-plagued seasons he retired from playing to become an assistant coach. He was appointed senior coach of the Melbourne Demons in 1998, guiding the club to the Grand Final against Essendon in 2000. He retired from coaching in 2007. Diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) in 2013, Daniher co-founded the organisation FightMND 'to take the fight right up to it'. He has since become the face of The Big Freeze, a fundraising event held annually when Melbourne play Collingwood at the MCG. Daniher was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2021 for his work with FightMND, which to date has raised over $50 million for research into treatments for the disease.\\n\\nMichael Peck formed his idea for this portrait after reading Daniher's memoir, in which he calls MND 'The Beast': 'an ugly piece of gear, hairy and dark, like a huge hybrid of a blowfly and a moth'. Peck depicted Daniher wearing a FightMND beanie, and Daniher wanted the portrait to show his arms, as they are where his condition is most evident. 'It was not comfortable for Neale to sit like this,' Peck says, 'but he was determined to capture the right image. This alone is testament to his strength and determination.'",

                            "- Neale's a Melbourne icon. I guess his career in football was legendary. And then, I guess the things he's done for the research and raising funds to fight motor neurone disease has been incredible. I think he took his profile and used that as a way to be able to do something really, really outstanding. Normally, if I'm painting a portrait, normally I meet and have a conversation and sort of think about that conversation and try and research the person a little bit before I try to really settle with what the concept's gonna be. When I first met Neale, I was able to go to his house and meet with his wife, Jan, and himself. He refers to motor neurone disease as the beast. You know, he refers to it as this ugly, terrible thing. You know, I think he, the way he explains it, it's halfway between a blowfly and a moth, and he said that that's the ugliest thing that he can possibly think of. I thought the idea of actually trying to portray that through trying to create visually what that looked like would be an important part of the painting. At the start, I said, \"Do you want your arms to be in the painting?\" And he said they have to be in the painting because they show the disease. In the image, he's sitting with his arms crossed in front of him, and for him to have his arms like that, Jan would put them up onto the plinth that we had in front of him. Yeah, he really wanted that because this painting had to be about his fight with motor neurone disease. And, although his arms are like that, he wanted them there, but he wanted to really be able to sit upright, look directly at the camera. And there's a really, something about his focus in the painting in those initial photographs was just dead on. It was sort of like, I'm gonna take this on. And yeah, I thought that was quite powerful. I've always made art. My mum always had art materials around the house. She'd go off and do art classes and bring home these, you know, the life drawings and the still lifes, and things that she was working on, and because the materials were there, and I'd always look at it and go, oh, I love that paper. I love that, you know, the chalk or the charcoal that she's working with, and I'd sort of just pick them up and start drawing. But no one ever sort of said, oh, you should do this. It was just something that I did. And I would sit there and I'd draw for hours and just love it. And that love of art has just always continued from an early age, you know, to now. It's gonna be there for the rest of my life, I think. I always wanna make sure that the sitter, it's gonna be an accurate depiction of who they are, and that I'm not saying something that's not true. And then, normally, I would work out, like, we'd do a photo shoot. I'd work from a series of images and actually create kind of like an aggregate of those images. I work from that, and then once I'm happy with that image, when it starts to feel right, that's when I start painting, and I go from that image. And I normally, I stick pretty closely to what that image is. And then, as I'm going, I might fine tune in the paint, you know, the contrast between light and dark or whether something needs to have less detail or more detail, you know. A lot of that comes out in the paints. I mean, my paintings end up looking a lot like photographs, but they need to be a heightened version of that. They can't just be a photograph. And also that's to do with my relationship with the painting. I need to be making decisions as I go so that I can love that process of paint. I've been interested in realism for forever. I mean, I wouldn't know to call it that when I was a kid, but, you know, the idea of taking something and trying to focus on the detail and pull things out, which make it, you know, which start to make the painting really, or the drawing, really stand out has always been something that I've loved. You know, when I was a kid, I used to draw the mountains and draw things from postcards or find things in the \"National Geographic\" and draw them. And then, as I started to realise that, you know, the images in the artworks can start to convey meaning, and you can tell the story and the narrative, I guess I started to really think about what I was putting into the images, how I would juxtapose one thing against another and it could start to tell a story. And also, that viewers could interpret those images in different ways, whether it was a way that I wanted them to read it, or whether it was a way that they could interpret it. So I always thought if someone can interpret an image differently than the way that I intend it to be, I always think that's a really nice thing to happen.",

--> 00:04:45.120\\nabout what I was putting into the images,\\n\\n106\\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.370\\nhow I would juxtapose one thing against another\\n\\n107\\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.100\\nand it could start to tell a story.\\n\\n108\\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.320\\nAnd also, that viewers could interpret\\n\\n109\\n00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.970\\nthose images in different

                            "Malaysia-born, Melbourne-based Weng-Ho Chong is an artist, designer, writer and poet, and design director of independent publisher Text Publishing. In 2023 Chong released his own book _Portraits_, with 300 drawings and paintings of culture makers including his friend, author Michelle de Kretser (b. 1957). Born in Sri Lanka, de Kretser began her career as an editor for Lonely Planet before turning to fiction. Her fourth novel, _Questions of Travel_ (2012) won a string of awards including the Miles Franklin Literary Award. De Kretser took out the Miles Franklin again in 2018 for _The Life to Come_, joining a select group of authors to win the prestigious award more than once. For this portrait, Chong included symbolic references to de Kretserâ€™s life and work, noting: â€˜The non-naturalistic compositional device, the fusion of abstraction and figuration, are nods to the post-modernist mode (evident in de Kretserâ€™s writing). The bookstack names writers who have affected her, including Patrick White, who takes his place as a tutelary spirit, top left. The dog shape below quotes Deborah Williamsâ€™ etching used on the original cover of de Kretserâ€™s _The Lost Dog_.â€™",

                            "Michelle de Kretser, Geography and History 2013 by Weng-Ho Chong is a tall rectangular mixed media acrylic painting on linen measuring one hundred and ninety-eight point five centimetres by one hundred and one point five centimetres. It's a portrait of Michelle de Kretser, author, who was born in Sri Lanka and emigrated to Australia when she was fourteen.\\n\\nMichelle's figure occupies the lower quadrant of the painting from the crown of her head, to below her knees, standing amidst various layers of abstract and realistic elements. The predominant background colour is citrus yellow with an undercoat of pale grey that is visible in parts. This flat painted background is interspersed with pinkish white panels, which are outlined and streaked in red orange and grey, bright emerald green horizontal and vertical lines divide the composition, and at the same time function as shelves and frames.\\n\\nIn the top left framed on three sides by green lines is a small portrait of the right of Patrick White as an old man. He has a severe expression on his craggy face, with mouth turned down and deep-set eyes glaring into the distance\\n\\nThe image is smudged and blurred like a charcoal sketch or an old photograph.\\n\\nOn the right, from the top to halfway down is a black silhouette of a palm tree, large jagged fronds form an uneven cartwheel shape which has been stencilled due to its fuzzy edges. A round white circle, which is either a moon or a bleached-out sun, shimmers through its branches. An overlay of fine green horizontal lines gives the impression that this scene is being partly viewed through an open venetian blind. On the left half way down a green horizontal line serves as a shelf for a stack of books of russet brown, royal blue and emerald green.\\n\\nNames printed on the spines read from the top down: E. Bishop; Chekov; White; Hazzard; de Kretser; Crompton. Below this is a small image on a screen have an open laptop. Close up it's a photograph of three people adrift in a choppy sea. They appear to be in distress, one in a yellow life jacket has the eyes closed, while the other two, one in an orange life jacket are holding on to each other and looking toward something.\\n\\nIn the lower left corner again stencilled in black as a silhouette of a partially visible dog, three legs a tail and perhaps a nose which has been cropped by a diagonal green line.\\n\\nIn the foreground on the right, Michelle is portrayed as almost life size and is framed on all sides by green lines including a diagonal green line that cuts across a figure below her hips. She is slight in build and stands with their right hand on her waist and her left upper arm obscured from view, facing to her left. Her short dark hair is parted on one side and pulled back into a spiky top not at the back of her head, with strands of hair falling over a forehead and temple. Her complexion is a warm peachy tan, and she has thick dark eyelashes and peaked eyebrows.\\n\\nHer eyes are downcast and her red brown lips a slightly parted, and her left hand is held up near a chin with fingers pinched together, giving the impression she's deep in thought.\\n\\nSilver rings adorn the third finger of her left hand. Michelle wears a white smock dress with short sleeves. The dress has a low flat collar and deep neckline and is done up with large round buttons down the front. Her hand on her waist pulls the fabric inward and creates folds running down to a deep gaping pocket on the side facing outwards. The dress comes to above the knee and bunches in the hem over the slim legs in dark brown leggings. Behind her legs there is a section of vertical deep blue wavy lines, reminiscent of rippling water.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Sally Dawson and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

                            "Peter Porter OAM (1929â€“2010), poet and critic, moved from Brisbane to London in 1951 at age 22. His work as an advertising copywriter influenced his early poetry, lucidly evoking the culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s. British poet Stephen Spender described Porter's mind as 'immensely fertile, lively, informed, honest and penetrating'. Porter's first collection of poems, _Once Bitten, Twice Bitten_, was published in Britain in 1961. The death of his wife in 1974 gave rise to the poetry collection _The Cost of Seriousness_ (1978). Porter's straddling of Australian and English culture remained central to his work, evoking urban and natural worlds. In 1990 Porter was awarded the Gold Medal of Australian Literature, and in 2002, the Queenâ€™s Gold Medal for Poetry.\\n\\nBest known for his landscapes, Tony Clark's work features conceptual, punk and pop qualities, as evidenced by the reduced palette of blue and pink in this portrait of Porter. The blue of Porter's floating head references Clark's preoccupation with the classicism of Josiah Wedgwood's Jasperware.",

                            "I usually write with fair facility, that is to say, it goes straight down, but I do a considerable amount of revision afterwards. However, the thing which is most interesting to me about the process of writing is what particularly moves you to write on a, say, a theme or a particular purpose. Well, with me itâ€™s rather like something sticking into me, something will get into my mind, and since I observe this much of a method that I have a set of notebooks which I work in, Iâ€™m usually working in, say, four notebooks at once and approaching from one end and from the other end, moving towards the middle, so that I have sort of places where I am working, like a workshop, like a sculptor might have his workshop where he has still got a piece, say, unfinished which he is working on. I have poems which are in unfinished states, which I keep going back to, and every time I get an idea for a poem I just put it in a margin and return to it. The one thing I do believe in is often choosing deliberately a particular external form before you actually choose your poem, though over the years Iâ€™ve tended to write more free verse poems, but I still like returning to poems in set forms and recently Iâ€™ve been writing a whole batch of sonnets.\\n\\nI also try to use different forms and to attempt things which I havenâ€™t done before, but mostly itâ€™s ideas, I suppose. Iâ€™m probably an impure poet, I believe in impure poetry, Iâ€™m not interested in lyrical qualities for themselves. What interests me in poetry is the confrontation of certain sorts of language, and therefore I like to be able to use many different styles, many different ways of doing things. I neither like to be particularly modern nor particularly traditional. In my view, the best poets are those who, starting from a traditional basis, widen the language by their own imagination.",

                            "Leo Schofield AM (b. 1935) has been a significant figure in Australiaâ€™s cultural life for decades. With a background in advertising and journalism, and a reputation as an uncompromising food critic (he established the Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide in 1984) he was the director of the Melbourne Festival from 1994 to 1996 and the Sydney Festival from 1997 to 2001. In the latter role, he was credited with making the annual showcase for music, dance, theatre, art and outdoor events more diverse, accessible and financially viable. From 1996 to 2000 he was the inaugural chairman of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra; in 2001 he directed the Olympic Arts Festival; and in 2002-2003 he directed the Sydney New Yearâ€™s Eve celebrations. A prominent commentator on museums and heritage issues, he painstakingly restored Sydneyâ€™s historic Bronte House during his tenancy there, and later revivified a historic house in Kempton, Tasmania. \\n\\nBrent Harris is a Melbourne-based painter and printmaker. In some of Harrisâ€™s abstract work, inaugural National Portrait Gallery Director Andrew Sayers noticed circular forms that were faintly suggestive of portraiture. Having been persuaded to undertake the commission, which came as a considerable surprise, Harris finished two different paintings of Schofield, and invited the Gallery to choose between them. In one, Schofield was pictured under a flowering wisteria. In the other â€“ this one â€“ the oval frame around Schofieldâ€™s sparely rendered, yet unmistakable face seemed to reflect his interest in colonial art.",

                            "Major changemakers in Australian fashion, designers Anna Plunkett and Luke Sales founded Romance Was Born in 2005. Their extravagant vision is achieved through exquisite craftmanship, vibrant prints and glimmering embellishments, often produced in collaboration with Australian artists such as Ken Done, Del Kathryn Barton and Jenny Kee. The first Australian label to be included in one of New Yorkâ€™s Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute exhibitions, Romance Was Born have dressed high-profile people including BjÃ¶rk, Miley Cyrus, Caroline Kennedy and Cate Blanchett.\\n\\nThis portrait defies the limits of a singular photographic moment. Artist Samuel Hodge, a long-time collaborator of the pair, mined his personal archive to create this dual portrait that celebrates the 20-year anniversary of the brand. Deftly combining hundreds of photographs of the designers and their collections â€“ from candid moments to backstage preparation and official campaigns â€“ Hodgeâ€™s portrait is both intimate and expansive. Paying tribute to the dynamism, playfulness, vitality and chaos of creative practice, each photograph amassed in this work offers us a glimpse into the world of Romance Was Born but also Plunkett and Sales as people. From afar, these image fragments appear like luminous gemstones â€“ a nod to the splendid, riotous colour that defines Romance Was Bornâ€™s designs.",

                            "Atong Atem is a South Sudanese contemporary artist, born in Ethiopia, who lives and works in Naarm/Melbourne. Working primarily in photography, video and textiles, Atem explores migrant narratives and postcolonial practices in the African diaspora, the relationship between public and private spaces, and the exploration of home and identity through portraiture.\\n\\nAtemâ€™s family emigrated to NSWâ€™s Central Coast from South Sudan in 1997 when she was six years old. Living in Melbourne since 2014, Atemâ€™s work speaks to her sense of belonging and connection to her community in Australia and beyond.\\n\\nIn her portraits, in which she often depicts herself, Atem pushes against the impact of ethnographic photography and the images that defined representation from the 19th century onwards. Instead, Atong looks to the studio portraiture of mid-20th-century African photographers such as Malick SidibÃ© and Seydou KeÃ¯ta, for whom the medium provided a powerful means of resistance.\\n\\nReferencing these photographersâ€™ dynamic and vibrant compositions, as well as South Sudanese Dinka culture, Atem extends a lineage of photographic work that celebrated their subjects and returned agency to them. As she has said, â€˜Iâ€™m interested in the moment in history when black people took the camera and chose to photograph ourselves for ourselvesâ€™.",

I work mostly with photography and video and tend to focus on portraiture.\\n\\nThe particular work that's here at the National Portrait Gallery, I'm wearing a lime green suit with a hat that's hiding my face a little bit and I'm sitting with a wide-legged stance, hands between my legs, staring quite sternly towards the camera. The series was really about me exploring presentation, especially when it comes to traditional photography on the African continent, that studio photography history, and how for so many people having the opportunity to be photographed was often a point of celebration or a significant moment, which meant that the way that people dressed and presented themselves to be photographed was quite formal, and if not formal, it was at least a moment to like truly express yourself and to present yourself in a way that is important. It was definitely intentional to make this particular work at that point in my life. And by that point I mean like post becoming a mother and having this new social identity and also in many ways having a new physical identity in the world and in the way that that body is interpreted, that body is sort of dictated.\\n\\nI've done a lot of photographs that look at that feminine performance of properness or perfection or costume, and this was an opportunity to do a masculine investigation. So I was looking at my uncles, my siblings, my dad and other male figures, as well as men who are in parliament, in government, and looking at the way that they've reinterpreted colonial Western standards of proper presentation for men and masculinity.",

                            "Nic Walkerâ€™s portraiture practice spans photography, moving image, installation and digital storytelling. Working with Tracey Holmes (b. 1966) and Stan Grant (b. 1963), Walker set out to create a portrait of the couple that would â€˜document their story of love and connection, culture and placeâ€™. \\n\\nStan Grant, Wiradjuri/Kamilaroi journalist, presenter, filmmaker and author, and his partner Tracey Holmes, a sports broadcaster and journalist, are depicted wrapped in fur pelts on Country. Infused with golden light, the pair are grounded on the Yarrangobilly River at a meeting place for the Ngunnawal and Wiradjuri peoples. Itâ€™s a place where Grantâ€™s heritage connects with Holmesâ€™ links to her Chinese ancestors, who settled in the district in the 19th century. As Grant revealed when the work was first displayed: â€˜Where we are is as important, if not more important, than who we are â€¦ Itâ€™s not just a love story between us, itâ€™s a love story of Country, and what Country means to so many people.â€™",

                            "David McAllister AC (b. 1963) and Noonuccal Nuugi man Wesley Enoch AM (b. 1969) have been together since 2007, but spent over a decade living in separate cities. When this photograph was taken, McAllister was the Australian Balletâ€™s artistic director in Melbourne and Enoch was the director of the Sydney Festival. They maintained a policy of never going more than three weeks without seeing each other â€“ somewhere. Peter Brew-Bevan wanted his portrait of them to capture this together-but-apart aspect of their relationship, while at the same time conveying â€˜their very strong bond and love for each otherâ€™. This is suggested by their poses and body language: seated together but looking away from each other and connected only through their hands. The esky in which McAllister appears to be icing his foot symbolises his â€˜hard physical commitment and dedication to danceâ€™, while Wesleyâ€™s T-shirt is a statement of his uncompromising advocacy for First Nations culture and creativity. McAllister left the Australian Ballet in late 2020 after almost 40 years with the company, while the 2021 Sydney Festival marked the end of Enochâ€™s tenure as festival director. â€˜I have Wesley by my side,â€™ McAllister wrote at the time, â€˜and Iâ€™m looking forward to us becoming old men together.â€™",

                            "I was one of those weird kids that just always wanted to dance. My family, you know, are fantastic; they're wonderful people. Dad was an accountant, Mum was my mum and I have brothers and sisters that there's no artistic sort of dance background in our family at all. So, I was this sort of mutant child who, you know, used to dance around the house all the time and I used to dance in front of the TV when the TV was off so I could see myself, you know, moving around. And whenever there was a family gathering, I was always putting on a show and annoying the hell out of everyone. So, I guess it was in my DNA and I didn't really have a plan B. Iâ€™d started training when I was seven. I didn't realize that all the other boys at school wouldn't think it was quite as cool as what I did. So, that was, a life journey. But yeah, I just love to dance. And I guess ballet, because I saw some ballet on TV, which was Rudolf Nureyev doing Don Quixote with the Australian Ballet. And I went, Oh, that's the sort of dance I want to do. And then I went to a ballet school and 10 years later I was in Melbourne at the Australian Ballet School. And two years later I joined the company.\\n\\nI've got to say the first time I saw that portrait, I was just in awe really. I'd seen all of the preparatory work that Peter had done through his journals and diaries and things, and he talked a lot about it. So, I guess I knew that the dance element would be as it was, and it was incredibly beautiful. But I had no idea of what I'd look like. And it was really, really amazing. He caught a moment that sort of not, I guess what people would think necessarily is a former dancer and, a, you know, artistic director, because we tend to be on, you know, sort of like â€˜Welcome to the balletâ€™. And it was sort of more of a pensive moment. And I really liked that â€™cos, you know, I feel like it's the side of me that sometimes people don't get to see. And so it's beautiful that it's the side that he's shown.",

                            "- I've gotta say, the first time I saw that portrait, I was just in awe, really. He caught a moment that's sort of not, I guess, what people would think necessarily as a former dancer and artistic director because we tend to be on. And it was sort of more of a pensive moment, and I really liked that 'cause I feel like it's this side of me that sometimes people don't get to see. I guess I've done a lot of portrait photographs in my life. Peter was amazing because he made it so comfortable like I didn't even really notice that he was taking the photos. We were just talking, and it almost felt like it wasn't a photo session except for the fact that I had really good make-up on, and someone had done my hair really nicely, so... And I think what was really nice is 'cause I was involved a little bit in helping them make the shapes, I mean we did lots and lots and lots of moving photographs to make the piece around me. And so I was sort of involved in that 'cause I couldn't help myself but go, \"Why don't you try this, \"and why don't you throw that leg up?\" So that was sort of fun. I was one of those weird kids that just always wanted to dance. And my family, you know, fantastic, very wonderful people. Mum and Dad, Dad was an accountant, Mum was my mum. And I have brothers and sisters that there's no artistic sort of dance background in our family at all. So I was sort of this mutant child who used to dance around the house all the time, and I used to dance in front of the TV when the TV was off, so I could see myself moving around. I didn't really have a plan B. I started training when I was seven. I saw some ballet on TV, which was Rudolf Nureyev doing Don Quixote with the Australian Ballet, and I went, \"Oh, that's the sort of dance I wanna do.\" It's not until you step off the stage that you realise how amazing it is because, you know, the curtain goes up, and even if you feel like you haven't done your best, there is this sense of great appreciation. And it really humbles you that people can react to you in that way. We have such a privilege to do what we do, and then to have the extra acknowledgement, I guess, of an audience to be so generous with their response is quite amazing. So it is something that you never forget, and it's addictive, I've gotta say. Something that your sort of miss when you stop dancing, you know? When I finish my day at the office now and get up from my desk, there's no one applauding anymore. It's like, but I feel lucky that I had that experience. I had a number of career-ending injuries, which luckily I managed to get through. When I was 26, I blew a disc in my back. And after nine months of really slow rehab and therapy and getting myself back into dancing again, I danced for another 11 years. So it was an extraordinary experience. And then the next time I had a big period like that was when I tore my cruciate ligament in my left knee. I think those injuries really taught me a lot about myself and my endurance, and I guess my passion for dancing. But it also set up the career that I now have. So when I was off, I would do things around the ballet company. I'd go to sponsorship functions, and patron functions, and be around the administration. So it sort of began my passion, I guess, for the other side of the organisation, the non-performance side. And now, as artistic director, I think I did my apprenticeship through those injuries. Kids loved to dance. You know, you go to a pre-primary class and you put music on and they all start dancing. And then somehow throughout school-age and teenagers we sort of lose that. You know, we've told to sit down and not move, and anyone that just spontaneously dances, it's sort of seen as being a bit weird. But I think anything that brings dance out of people is really fantastic, and I love that. When you go and see a performance, it's not just what the artists do on stage, it's how you interpret it, so it's interactive. And it can be very seductive, and it's very physical, but it's also very emotional, and, I think, quite visceral that you actually have this opportunity to see people without words telling complex stories.",

00:01:05.717\\n\"Why don't you try this,\\n\\n25\\n00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:07.624\\n\"and why don't you throw that leg up?\"\\n\\n26\\n00:01:07.624 --> 00:01:09.624\\nSo that was sort of fun.\\n\\n27\\n00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:13.175\\nI was one of those weird kids\\n\\n28\\n00:01:13.175 --> 00:01:15.540\\nthat just always wanted to dance.\\n\\n29\\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.707\\nAnd my family, you know, fantastic, very wonderful people.\\n\\n30\\n00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:24.748\\nMum and Dad, Dad was an accountant, Mum was my mum.\\n\\n31\\n00:01:24.748 --> 00:01:26.837\\nAnd I have brothers and sisters that there's\\n\\n32\\n00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:31.130\\nno artistic sort of dance background in our family at all.\\n\\n33\\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.913\\nSo I was sort of this mutant child\\n\\n34\\n00:01:32.913 --> 00:01:35.242\\nwho used to dance around the house all the time,\\n\\n35\\n00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:38.600\\nand I used to dance in front of the TV when the TV was off,\\n\\n36\\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.982\\nso I could see myself moving around.\\n\\n37\\n00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:43.222\\nI didn't really have a plan B.\\n\\n38\\n00:01:43.222 --> 00:01:45.669\\nI started training when I was seven.\\n\\n39\\n00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:48.349\\nI saw some ballet on TV, which was Rudolf Nureyev\\n\\n40\\n00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.596\\ndoing Don Quixote with the Australian Ballet,\\n\\n41\\n00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:54.763\\nand I went, \"Oh, that's the sort of dance I wanna do.\"\\n\\n42\\n00:01:55.738 --> 00:01:57.878\\nIt's not until you step off the stage\\n\\n43\\n00:01:57.878 --> 00:01:59.879\\nthat you realise how amazing it is\\n\\n44\\n00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:01.500\\nbecause, you know, the curtain goes up,\\n\\n45\\n00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.944\\nand even if you feel like you haven't done your best,\\n\\n46\\n00:02:05.944 --> 00:02:09.040\\nthere is this sense of great appreciation.\\n\\n47\\n00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.940\\nAnd it really humbles you\\n\\n48\\n00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.278\\nthat people can react to you in that way.\\n\\n49\\n00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:16.240\\nWe have such a privilege to do what we do,\\n\\n50\\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.989\\nand then to have the extra acknowledgement, I guess,\\n\\n51\\n00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.230\\nof an audience to be so generous\\n\\n52\\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.810\\nwith their response is quite amazing.\\n\\n53\\n00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.560\\nSo it is something that you never forget,\\n\\n54\\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.309\\nand it's addictive, I've gotta say.\\n\\n55\\n00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:31.480\\nSomething that your sort of miss\\n\\n56\\n00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.918\\nwhen you stop dancing, you know?\\n\\n57\\n00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:36.410\\nWhen I finish my day at the office now\\n\\n58\\n00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.601\\nand get up from my desk, there's no one applauding anymore.\\n\\n59\\n00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:43.384\\nIt's like, but I feel lucky that I had that experience.\\n\\n60\\n00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:46.217 line:15% \\n(symphonic music)\\n\\n61\\n00:02:48.482 --> 00:02:51.269 line:15% \\nI had a number of career-ending injuries,\\n\\n62\\n00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.429\\nwhich luckily I managed to get through.\\n\\n63\\n00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.186 line:15% \\nWhen I was 26, I blew a disc in my back.\\n\\n64\\n00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:59.386 line:15% \\nAnd after nine months of really slow rehab and therapy\\n\\n65\\n00:02:59.386 --> 00:03:02.456\\nand getting myself back into dancing again,\\n\\n66\\n00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:03.986\\nI danced for another 11 years.\\n\\n67\\n00:03:03.986 --> 00:03:06.635\\nSo it was an extraordinary experience.\\n\\n68\\n00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:09.626\\nAnd then the next time I had a big period like that was\\n\\n69\\n00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.773\\nwhen I tore my cruciate ligament in my left knee.\\n\\n70\\n00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:15.256\\nI think those injuries really taught me a lot\\n\\n71\\n00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:18.058\\nabout myself and my endurance,\\n\\n72\\n00:03:18.058 --> 00:03:21.285\\nand I guess my passion for dancing.\\n\\n73\\n00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:24.051\\nBut it also set up the career that I now have.\\n\\n74\\n00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:25.751\\nSo when I was off, I would\\n\\n75\\n00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:27.947\\ndo things around the ballet company.\\n\\n76\\n00:03:27.947 --> 00:03:30.879\\nI'd go to sponsorship functions, and patron functions,\\n\\n77\\n00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.253\\nand be around the administration.\\n\\n78\\n00:03:34.253 --> 00:03:36.930\\nSo it sort of began my passion, I guess,\\n\\n79\\n00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.834\\nfor the other side of the organisation,\\n\\n80\\n00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:40.104\\nthe non-performance side.\\n\\n81\\n00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:41.862\\nAnd now, as artistic director,\\n\\n82\\n00:03:41.862 --> 00:03:46.029\\nI think I did my apprenticeship through those injuries.\\n\\n83\\n00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:48.642\\nKids loved to dance.\\n\\n84\\n00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:52.493\\nYou know, you go to a pre-primary class\\n\\n85\\n00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:54.922\\nand you put music on and they all start dancing.\\n\\n86\\n00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:58.089\\nAnd then somehow throughout school-age\\n\\n87\\n00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:01.202\\nand teenagers we sort of lose that.\\n\\n88\\n00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:03.222\\nYou know, we've told to sit down and not move,\\n\\n89\\n00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:06.254\\nand anyone that just spontaneously dances,\\n\\n90\\n00:04:06.254 --> 00:04:09.459\\nit's sort of seen as being a bit weird.\\n\\n91\\n00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.322 line:15% \\nBut I think anything that brings dance\\n\\n92\\n00:04:12.322 --> 00:04:16.373 line:15% \\nout of people is really fantastic, and I love that.\\n\\n93\\n00:04:16.373 --> 00:04:17.922\\nWhen you go and see a performance,\\n\\n94\\n00:04:17.922 --> 00:04:20.202\\nit's not just what the artists do on stage,\\n\\n95\\n00:04:20.202 --> 00:04:23.143\\nit's how you interpret it, so it's interactive.\\n\\n96\\n00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:27.310\\nAnd it can be very seductive, and it's very physical,\\n\\n97\\n00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:32.704\\nbut it's also very emotional, and, I think, quite visceral\\n\\n98\\n00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:36.613\\nthat you actually have this opportunity to see\\n\\n99\\n00:04:36.613 --> 00:04:40.363\\npeople without words telling complex stories.\\n\\n",

                            "Photographer Rennie Ellis took this relaxed portrait of AC/DC lead singer Ronald â€˜Bonâ€™ Scott (1946â€“1980) and guitarist Angus Young (b. 1955) backstage at Symphony Hall in Atlanta, Georgia, USA on AC/DCâ€™s 1978 international tour. Australiaâ€™s most successful band ever, AC/DC was signed to an international deal in 1975 but American success did not come until â€˜Highway to Hellâ€™ reached number 17 on the US charts in 1979. Scott told photographer Rennie Ellis in 1978 that he could see no end to the â€˜rollicking adventureâ€™, but two years later Scottâ€™s hard-partying lifestyle caught up with him â€“ officially he died of acute alcohol poisoning. His grave in Fremantle is the most-visited grave in Australia. In 2004, UK magazine _Classic Rock_ rated Scott as number one in a list of the 100 Greatest Frontmen. Significantly, however, and largely thanks to Angus Youngâ€™s star status, the band weathered the loss of Scott and his replacement with Brian Johnston. AC/DCâ€™s _Back in Black_, issued five months after Scottâ€™s death, is said to be the second-highest-selling album of all time worldwide.",

In this photograph, the artist appears with his first wife, Joy Hester (1920â€“1960). Like Tucker, Hester had a vigorous and deeply felt approach to making art. They were both part of the group of artists and thinkers centred around Heide, the home of arts patrons John and Sunday Reed on the outskirts of Melbourne. During her lifetime, Hesterâ€™s work was overshadowed by those of her male contemporaries, but it is now widely acknowledged, especially her drawings, which are characterised by their intense emotion and spare, simple gestures. Hesterâ€™s life was beset by sadness. Diagnosed with Hodgkinâ€™s disease at the age of 27, she left Tucker for a fellow artist, Gray Smith. Despite her prognosis, she continued to work through the 13 years until her death at the age of 40.",

                            "The question of why I paint is always pretty ambiguous. I think itâ€™s answering an inner compulsion, because if I didnâ€™t find this particular form of activity â€“ to me itâ€™s one that is defining things to myself and defining myself â€“ Iâ€™m not quite sure what would happen to me if I didnâ€™t answer this kind of inner compulsion. And I suppose it relates to oneâ€™s attitude to life. I think that, despite all the negative and destructive powers that are constantly at work with us, that one is constantly striving to affirm life, to be in love with it, and these are the tokens of affection on our way, as it were.\\n\\nThe question of why I paint the particular things I do is also pretty ambiguous. I think I would say that Iâ€™m trying to exorcise my own particular devils, and I suppose some of them get into the painting. I hope they do, thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m trying to put them, and get rid of them.\\n\\nBut once out, of course, one can then feel this kind of relaxation, the affirmation flows in, and the devils in the painting can sometimes turn into angels.\\n\\nI suppose in the act of work that it is essentially a struggle to escape the enmeshment of oneâ€™s ego, and in the attempt to struggle free one seems externally, to the external world, to be a very egocentric person, because youâ€™re following a necessary compulsion without which one loses oneâ€™s own balance and direction in life; and in the act of working one is defining these shapes, ejecting them as it were, and getting rid of them; and this process of ejectment is one there which is defining and clarifying oneâ€™s own particular kind of energy which you are attempting to flow out into life.",

While studying law at the University of Tasmania he led a successful campaign to reclaim Trukaniniâ€™s remains from the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in Hobart, to rightfully return her back to Country. Guboo Ted Thomas, a Yuin activist, musician and sacred site knowledge holder, contributed to the land rights movement in the 1970s. He lobbied for the return of title deeds to his people and led campaigns against the environmental destruction of Biamanga (Mumbulla Mountain). Both men held an unwavering commitment to campaigning for Aboriginal rights at every level, dedicating their lives to First Nations activism.",

Both were unswerving in their lifelong commitment to advancing the rights of First Nations people. Quandamooka woman and esteemed poet Noonuccal was a leading voice in the charge for nationwide recognition of Australiaâ€™s First Nations people, including the campaign for the 1967 Referendum for constitutional change and co-founding the National Tribal Council. An early career in nursing ultimately led Yankunjatjara woman Oâ€™Donoghue into First Nations advocacy and public administration. She worked with the Australian government on Native Title, was the inaugural chair of both the National Aboriginal Conference and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and helped draft the Mabo legislation. In her powerful Australia Day Address on 24 January 2000, Oâ€™Donoghue said â€˜my dearest hope is that I may be able to contribute to positive changeâ€™. Murri photographer Mervyn Bishop took this double portrait at the National Aboriginal Conference in Canberra in April 1978, as part of his groundbreaking work for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.",

                            "I would say that the majority of the Australian people voted Yes in favour of the Aboriginal people merely to clear their guilty conscience. Itâ€™s easy to put a mark on a ballot paper, and I must say this definitely, that there was a small minority group of sincere Australian people but I would say 75 [per cent] of those who voted Yes did it to clear their guilty conscience.\\n\\nIncidentally, itâ€™s interesting to understand why those terrible discriminative laws were put into the books. In the first place, our civic fathers, or the white manâ€™s civic fathers of long ago, during the â€˜soothing of the dying pillowâ€™ era, the politicians, or the statesmen of that time, were writing over to Queen Victoria saying, â€˜The Aborigine is dying out.â€™ And true, he was â€“ they were poisoning him with strychnine in the waterholes and they were shooting him, and they were doing all sorts of things. And the Aborigine dropped from 300,000 strong to 80,000 in a very short period of time. So it was quite natural for them to say the Aborigine was a dying race.\\n\\nNow it was during this period of time that the Constitution was being fixed, and as they thought we were a dying race, to save themselves a lot of bother they said, â€˜Well we will not count the Aborigines and we do not have to make laws for the Aborigines, because theyâ€™re going to die out anywayâ€™. And this is the reason today why Aboriginals have not had any education, any decent housing, any facilities that the white Australian enjoys today. Itâ€™s because of that stupid business of thinking the Aboriginals were going to die out.\\n\\nMind you, the Aboriginals are a determined lot, and theyâ€™re quite ungrateful. They didnâ€™t die, they lived on and are still living on; in spite of the many attempts to commit genocide and assassinate us all, we are still here. I think weâ€™ll last the white man out, truly.",

                            "In 1965 I think it was, we were invited to go in and talk to the then prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies. There was a deputation from all over Australia of Aboriginal spokesmen and women and we did go in. Sir Robert Menzies had told the public and the politicians, the people of the House, that he would not have a referendum in his lifetime as prime minister. Heâ€™d been badly beaten on the referendum before where he had appealed to the people to outlaw Communism and when the people said â€˜No outlawing of the Communist Partyâ€™, Sir Robert Menzies refused then to have anything to do with referendums in his lifetime as prime minister.\\n\\nWe lobbied the House of Parliament and itâ€™s to their discredit, really, that when we asked them to bring out the laws concerning the Aboriginal people that there was no laws, no books on the Aboriginal people in their archives or libraries, and they had to quickly have them printed, so that the politicians could read what it was, for and against the Aborigines. There was one, however, on the national â€“ the Canberra law book saying that if Aboriginals go into Canberra, any Justice of the Peace could declare them illegal immigrants into Canberra and they could be chased out of Canberra. This still applied to us, incidentally, at this period of time. And we always made a joke of it when we went to Canberra, you know, â€˜If you get into trouble, you know the law on the book. If a JP says Get Out, make sure you get your blanket,â€™ because the law still said that before sending them out of Canberra, they must first issue them with one government blanket. So we were determined weâ€™d get our government blanket if ever they threw us out.  \\nWe told everyone this and we made it a laughingstock â€“ Canberra a laughingstock â€“ to such an extent that the first thing Sir Robert Menzies did was delete that off the Canberra constitution. So itâ€™s no longer there.",

But I quickly got to know him and respect him, and I knew that by the questioning and so on that he was really trying to find out more about me. So, Iâ€™m not sure that he knew much about [the] Stolen Generation. After I saw the portrait come out, I myself felt the portrait wasnâ€™t like me because Robert had told me very early in the piece that I wasnâ€™t to smile. He doesnâ€™t like smiling portraits. People who know me of course know that I do smile a lot.\\n\\nThe suit that I wore on the day, I think he was a bit surprised because it was really quite formal and itâ€™s a suit that I wear when I receive the many awards that Iâ€™ve received over the years. My family had no difficulty at all seeing me turn up in that same suit. And because it was a portrait, I thought, well, you know, Iâ€™m an Aboriginal woman and Iâ€™m going to wear the Aboriginal flag, and Iâ€™m going to wear everything red, black and yellow.\\n\\nIâ€™m much more proud of the fact that Iâ€™m a nurse and that I was able to use my nursing experience to actually travel to remote areas in my own, well in my own right, just doing what I could to heal people. I didnâ€™t know my people very well and so on, this is one way of getting to know them out on the APY lands. I have had a lot of senior jobs, met just so many people in high places, really. And I enjoyed seeing them but they werenâ€™t the most important things in my life. It was really about making a difference.",

It was taken by Mervyn Bishop. It is a gelatin silver photograph on paper and measures approximately 30 centimetres high by 30 centimetres wide.\\n\\nThe photograph shows Oodgeroo and Lowitja smiling broadly, standing side by side in front of an intricately patterned wallpaper. \\n\\nIn this black and white image the background wallpaper has a light-toned pattern of vertical stripes and floral paisley designs.\\n\\nLowitja is on the left, taller than Oodgeroo, with her face positioned almost straight towards us and her body angling slightly in towards Oodgeroo.\\n\\nLowitjaâ€™s hair is dark and shiny with a few threads of grey. It is parted at the side, with short soft waves cropped close, framing her face. Her hair stops at her chin, kicking out at the ends. She has gently curving light brows above dark eyes, looking out towards Oodgeroo beyond the right of the photograph. She has a small, rounded nose and her cheeks are bunched up from her smile. Lowitja has a big grin showing the top row of her teeth.\\n\\nShe wears a blouse with a high, ruffled collar that appears white in the image. Below her chin, centred in her collar is a small brooch. The blouse has long puffed sleeves, with the same ruffles on the cuffs as on the collar. Lowitjaâ€™s arms hang relaxed beside her, hands loosely closed. Sheâ€™s wearing a straight skirt, its fabric covered in a dense geometric pattern.\\n\\nOodgeroo stands close to Lowitja on the right. Her face is positioned towards the camera. Her body is angled towards Lowitja. She has short dark hair greying at the temples, curling up and back off her face. Her light-toned eyes look directly towards us through large, slim-framed glasses. Oodgeroo has a small nose. Her cheeks are rounded and slightly dimpled from her wide smile. Her lips are parted revealing the top row of her teeth.\\n\\nOodgeroo is wearing a loose-fitting top that looks white in the black and white photograph. It has a round collar, long sleeves, and a trim of white fringe along the lower edge. The position and gesture of Oodgerooâ€™s arms and hands mimic Lowitjaâ€™s; arms by her sides and fingers gently closed. Beneath her top she has on a straight skirt from a fabric with a slight sheen.\\n\\n**Audio description script written and voiced by Lucinda Shawcross**",

                            "Senior Anmatyerre woman and culture leader Emily Kame/ Kam Kngwarreye (c. 1910â€“1996) is celebrated as one of the most significant contemporary artists of the 20th century. Kngwarreye described her artworks as representations of the â€˜whole lotâ€™, a visual telling of her Country and Culture spanning dreamings, story, song, mapping, animals, bush foods and plants. She began painting on canvas late in life, and in just eight years she is estimated to have produced over 3000 works.\\n\\nDescribed as inseparable, Emily and Lily Sandover Kngwarreye (c. 1937â€“2002) were sisters (married to brothers), friends and fellow artists, and a source of companionship and support to one another throughout their lives. Seated behind Emily, Lily is embedded in the world of the painting, as an integral part of Emilyâ€™s identity. Giving a sense of both space and proximity, the women are in an orbit of their own making, two individuals within the same life story.\\n\\nPainter Jenny Sages sketched Emily and Lily while visiting Alhalkere Country in Central Australia, before developing this painting in her studio on Birrabirragal/Gadigal Country in Sydney.",

                            "The portrait is of Anmatyerre woman, Emily Kame Kngwarreye, one of Australiaâ€™s most significant contemporary artists, with her friend Lily. The painting was made by Jenny Sages in 1993, oil on canvas, and measures 2.16m tall by 1.85m wide, including its frame. The frame itself is discrete and simple, made from blond wood, and measuring about 2cm thick. \\n\\nThe portrait depicts Emily, close up, sitting cross legged, grounded on the earth, in the right foreground, and Lily, also sitting, some distance behind Emily, about half way up, and on the left edge of the picture. The focus and detail is on Emily, while Lily and the background landscape are less distinct. The warm orange-browns, yellows and whites, painted in loose, delicate brush strokes, shimmer and shine, capturing the heat of the day. \\n\\nThe background of the painting is flat and sparse, with no defined horizon, only a gentle gradient from lighter tones smudging together at the top, to darker shades in more defined strokes nearer the bottom. \\n\\nLily is shown at the very far left edge of the painting, her right side partially cropped. Her hair is a tangled mass of dark curls framing her round, dark skinned, face. Her face is angled slightly up to her left, as if she is turning towards Emily. Lilyâ€™s eyes seem to be on her friend and a smile plays over her closed lips. Lily wears a t-shirt, coloured in deep green-browns, with dashes of yellow where the light hits it. Her arms are loose with her hands resting, fingers just touching, in her lap. Lily is wearing a blue-green skirt and her bare legs are crossed.\\n\\nOn the ground between Lily and Emily is a pale grey-blue mass of lines which looks like the ashes of a small fire. \\n\\nThe portrait of Emily dominates the painting. Emily faces you directly, her head positioned straight on. Around her head, the brush strokes change from following the horizontal direction of the land in the background of the painting, to following the oval shape of her face, forming a sort of halo in whites and pale yellows. Emilyâ€™s white hair is cropped close to her skull, and her dark skin can be seen through it. Her forehead is high and elaborately furrowed â€“ the furrows having their nexus at, and are most prominent where her brows, eyes, and nose meet. Emilyâ€™s eyes are dark crevices, the irises barely visible, surrounded by wrinkled skin. Her nose is large and smooth, with wide nostrils, and her ears are long and lie flat against her head. Emilyâ€™s cheeks are bunched up and deep lines run beneath them, between her nose and mouth. Emilyâ€™s lips are closed, with the lower slightly fuller than the upper - they are difficult to read, perhaps the glimmer of a smile is passing over them, or they may be set in resignation. Beneath the lips she has a small round chin, around this, her skin is loose and falls into the shadows of her creased neck. \\n\\nWound about Emilyâ€™s neck and tied loosely at her front, is a scarf, painted in fine brush strokes of pale yellows, orange-ochres and greens. Her top too, is made from many colours, - haphazard strokes in orange and yellow are layered and criss-cross each other in rich texture over her broad, rounded, and relaxed shoulders. These warm colours give over to lilac, mint-green, and black brush strokes, weaving together, and defining the volume and contours of her chest. \\n\\nEmilyâ€™s elbows rest comfortably on the thighs of her crossed legs. Her bare forearms are covered in thick veins, her large, wrinkled hands come together at her shins, the left sitting lightly, partially over the right. Light falls on the hands, highlighting their creased skin, emphasising them. Emilyâ€™s skirt covers her crossed legs, and is white, with patches of bright orange-red and the suggestion of a floral pattern in greens and browns. Part of her left foot, in a white shoe, pokes out from under her right knee. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

                            "Western Aranda artist Vincent Namatjira OAM is known for his witty, lively and memorable portraits. His paintings often challenge the intersections of Culture, Country, leadership, wealth, power, satire and influence. Namatjira combines political critique with deeply personal histories, which unfold in scenes of vibrant colour and bold brushwork. \\n\\nIn this portrait Vincent represents himself alongside his great-grandfather Albert Namatjira (1902â€“1959) (Western Arrernte/Aranda/Arrarnta), a celebrated artist of layered, detailed and masterful watercolours of Country. Vincent attests to the skill and astute attention Albert embedded in his works, identifying the ways he â€˜was able to capture the unique light and the beauty of his Countryâ€™. _Albert and Vincent_ is a portrait that honours lineage and is a portal across time. By including his great-grandfather alongside his own self portrait, Vincent allows the two artists to converge in time and space â€“ theirs is a shared legacy of family, artistic practice and connection through Country, ever-present and continuous.",

Their playful and performative portraits evoke glamour, queerness, magic and androgynous freedom. \\n\\nThe self portraits _Smalltown Boy (Surfers Paradise)_ and _Smalltown Boy (Perth)_ are from a series in which the artists recreated retro postcards as tributes to their shared experiences of growing up queer in suburban Australia, and to imaginatively enact what it might have been like if they met each other as teenagers. Self-described as a â€˜dreaming of each otherâ€™, the portraits imagine a multiverse where past and present collide, where they are both adults and their younger selves. The two are â€˜joined by a sequin string heartâ€™ that bridges the 4000-kilometre distance that separated them for so long.",

                            "- It was so successful, we just got asked to do lots of things together and we didn't even call ourselves The Huxleys. People would say, \"Oh, the Huxleys are here. Who are these, Huxleys?\" So everything just happened. It wasn't really planned.\\n\\n- When we started making art, no art places took us seriously. We tried to show in galleries to represent us and tried to get the art community behind us and no one was interested. And we were just like, \"We love doing this enough that we're just going to put it out into the world.\" And we kept making things on our own, funding our own projects, doing it because we loved it. And eventually people catch up with you and you know, a lot of people ask us, \"Do you make your own things?\" And we're like, \"Where else would we find these?\" And I think by the fact that you're not trained, or neither of us are trained is a good thing because it allows you to dream bigger. Otherwise you might say, \"That can't be created.\"\\n\\n- You're not confined by any rules and you make things that other people will be like, \"Oh, you can't do that.\" And you just find a way, so you just do it. And I've had fashion designers look at my work and go, \"How did you do this,\" or, \"How do you get into it?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, this way and that way.\" But you just don't have any rules in your head.\\n\\n- Garrett and I decided to make a series of work called \"Postcards from the Edge.\" And these are postcards from the areas and the places that we grew up in. So Garrett is from the Gold Coast and I am from Perth. And we went on this journey where we tried to find and source postcards from the area and the places that exactly places that we were in as children.\\n\\n- Yeah, and by taking yourself back to that time as you are now, I felt the same as, you know, when I was 12 in that situation even though I wasn't you know, painted in green, glitter, and had wigs. I felt like that. And I completely felt like that so it was nice, you know, bringing those two worlds together.\\n\\n- And one thing that we did that was nice with the postcards is this two postcards called \"Small Town Boy: Perth\" and \"Small Town Boy: Gold Coast.\" Where we actually meet and we're joined by a sequin string of heart between us. And it was our idea that wouldn't it been wonderful if we had actually met from those places. And it's a way of us coming together. We did a thing together maybe five years ago, it was called \"People of Letters.\" We wrote letters from the time when we were struggling, growing up in these places to each other, like dreaming of each other. And it was so beautiful because it was just like the idea that you could have someone that would make you feel okay for who you were at that time. Like, if I had met Garrett when I was in school, I think my life would've been a lot easier. And that was something that, yeah.\\n\\n- And it's been nice since we've met each other and being together, we go back to Perth and the Gold Coast. And in a place that you used to get yelled at for being gay, being called poof, or whatever. You know, people are like, \"I like your outfit.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, this is nice.\" You know, things are changing which is really beautiful.\\n\\n- The idea of masking is fascinating to me because it creates this almost anonymous, we could be anyone or anything underneath that mask. And it gives this sense of freedom. For me I love the idea that it takes away, you know, wearing costumes that hide your identity. It takes away gender and it takes away race and class and all these things that were divided and put into binaries. And once you become this creation, it's so freeing and I couldn't get up and perform as well, obviously, it would be terrifying. But when I'm at an amazing costume and makeup and wigs, it creates this diversion that allows me to be the most fantastical escapist version of myself possible. It gives me the confidence.\\n\\n- Yeah, I think wearing the mask came from not wanting to be seen first, so hiding behind the mask. 'Cause I grew up very shy and still am quite shy and introverted. And I find it more interesting to look at as well. I find something like that more interesting. But you develop something in you, you find a power or something that isn't you. It's a freedom, you escape from all these constraints on yourself. So there is something really liberating about performing not as yourself, but as these characters that you've created in a way, but it's still you, you know.\\n\\n- In costume, generally it always interested me. Even like, people, military, or any kind of costume, you're putting on something to go out in the world and do a role and do something that you maybe not when you're at home.\\n\\n- Well, what's interesting, when we make our costumes, we don't know who's going to pop out in a way. And it's just so interesting, like you think, \"Oh my God, I can't believe I'm this frantic character inside this costume. Didn't expect this.\" And yeah, the latest ones we know something's going to happen. We put the latest costumes on and we're like, \"Oh, this is slow.\" You know, there's a slow kind of graceful people that are happening at the moment. It's really exciting.\\n\\n- We call it from page to stage. We love the drawings that we do when we come up with an idea. So basically, I mean neither us are very good drawers. I'm particularly bad, but they're like childlike drawings of either like a photographic scene or a costume. And it's amazing when you take that childlike drawing and then bring it into a reality. I love that transformation. And the costumes often end up looking like me.\\n\\n- They look like, the pictures.\\n\\n- The pictures, but like a heightened glamorous version. I love seeing the contrast between those two things and they're your dream and then the reality made. Yeah, I think that is one of the great thrills for me seeing it when it comes to life. Yeah.\\n\\n- And in between that there's a lot of frustration, tears. And, \"This isn't going to work.\"\\n\\n- Yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot of failures, trial and error, you know.",

00:02:51.370\\ngrowing up in these places to each other,\\n\\n59\\n00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.060\\nlike dreaming of each other.\\n\\n60\\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.040\\nAnd it was so beautiful because it was just like the idea\\n\\n61\\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.047\\nthat you could have someone that would make you feel okay\\n\\n62\\n00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:02.653\\nfor who you were at that time.\\n\\n63\\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.590\\nLike, if I had met Garrett when I was in school,\\n\\n64\\n00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.290\\nI think my life would've been a lot easier.\\n\\n65\\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.900\\nAnd that was something that, yeah.\\n\\n66\\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.660\\n<v ->And it's been nice since we've met each other</v>\\n\\n67\\n00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.780\\nand being together, we go back to Perth and the Gold Coast.\\n\\n68\\n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.050\\nAnd in a place that you used to get yelled at for being gay,\\n\\n69\\n00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.200\\nbeing called poof, or whatever.\\n\\n70\\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.490\\nYou know, people are like, \"I like your outfit.\"\\n\\n71\\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.060\\nAnd I'm like, \"Okay, this is nice.\"\\n\\n72\\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.860\\nYou know, things are changing which is really beautiful.\\n\\n73\\n00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:35.310\\n(bright upbeat music)\\n\\n74\\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.700\\n<v ->The idea of masking is fascinating to me</v>\\n\\n75\\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.530\\nbecause it creates this almost anonymous,\\n\\n76\\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.240\\nwe could be anyone or anything underneath that mask.\\n\\n77\\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.210\\nAnd it gives this sense of freedom.\\n\\n78\\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.570\\nFor me I love the idea that it takes away, you know,\\n\\n79\\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.180\\nwearing costumes that hide your identity.\\n\\n80\\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.910\\nIt takes away gender and it takes away race and class\\n\\n81\\n00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.570\\nand all these things that were divided\\n\\n82\\n00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.400\\nand put into binaries.\\n\\n83\\n00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.330\\nAnd once you become this creation, it's so freeing\\n\\n84\\n00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.670\\nand I couldn't get up and perform as well, obviously,\\n\\n85\\n00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.280\\nit would be terrifying.\\n\\n86\\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.280\\nBut when I'm at an amazing costume and makeup and wigs,\\n\\n87\\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.460\\nit creates this diversion that allows me\\n\\n88\\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.230\\nto be the most fantastical escapist version\\n\\n89\\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.050\\nof myself possible.\\n\\n90\\n00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.284\\nIt gives me the confidence.\\n\\n91\\n00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:29.290\\n<v ->Yeah, I think wearing the mask came from not wanting</v>\\n\\n92\\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.160\\nto be seen first, so hiding behind the mask.\\n\\n93\\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.990\\n'Cause I grew up very shy and still am\\n\\n94\\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.440\\nquite shy and introverted.\\n\\n95\\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.460\\nAnd I find it more interesting to look at as well.\\n\\n96\\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.940\\nI find something like that more interesting.\\n\\n97\\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.530\\nBut you develop something in you, you find a power\\n\\n98\\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.300\\nor something that isn't you.\\n\\n99\\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.870\\nIt's a freedom, you escape from all these constraints\\n\\n100\\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.150\\non yourself.\\n\\n101\\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.490\\nSo there is something really liberating about performing\\n\\n102\\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.110\\nnot as yourself, but as these characters that you've created\\n\\n103\\n00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.267\\nin a way, but it's still you, you know. (laughs)\\n\\n104\\n00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:07.413\\n<v ->In costume, generally it always interested me.</v>\\n\\n105\\n00:05:07.413 --> 00:05:11.520\\nEven like, people, military, or any kind of costume,\\n\\n106\\n00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.936\\nyou're putting on something to go out in the world\\n\\n107\\n00:05:13.936 --> 00:05:18.060\\nand do a role and do something that you maybe not\\n\\n108\\n00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.470\\nwhen you're at home.\\n\\n109\\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.780\\n<v ->Well, what's interesting, when we make our costumes,</v>\\n\\n110\\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.300\\nwe don't know who's going to pop out in a way.\\n\\n111\\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.660\\nAnd it's just so interesting, like you think, \"Oh my God,\\n\\n112\\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.060\\nI can't believe I'm this frantic character inside\\n\\n113\\n00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.980\\nthis costume.\\n\\n114\\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.410\\nDidn't expect this.\"\\n\\n115\\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.810\\nAnd yeah, the latest ones we know something's\\n\\n116\\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.643\\ngoing to happen.\\n\\n117\\n00:05:35.643 --> 00:05:38.057\\nWe put the latest costumes on and we're like,\\n\\n118\\n00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:39.454\\n\"Oh, this is slow.\"\\n\\n119\\n00:05:39.454 --> 00:05:42.140\\nYou know, there's a slow kind of graceful people\\n\\n120\\n00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.718\\nthat are happening at the moment.\\n\\n121\\n00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.230\\nIt's really exciting.\\n\\n122\\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.019\\n<v ->We call it from page to stage.</v>\\n\\n123\\n00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.852\\n(Garrett laughs)\\n\\n124\\n00:05:49.852 --> 00:05:54.100\\nWe love the drawings that we do when we come up\\n\\n125\\n00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.310\\nwith an idea.\\n\\n126\\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.120\\nSo basically, I mean neither us are very good drawers.\\n\\n127\\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.380\\nI'm particularly bad, but they're like childlike drawings\\n\\n128\\n00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.290\\nof either like a photographic scene or a costume.\\n\\n129\\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.290\\nAnd it's amazing when you take that childlike drawing\\n\\n130\\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.283\\nand then bring it into a reality.\\n\\n131\\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.700\\nI love that transformation.\\n\\n132\\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.680\\nAnd the costumes often end up looking like me.\\n\\n133\\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.065\\n<v ->They look like, the pictures.</v>\\n\\n134\\n00:06:22.065 --> 00:06:24.230\\n<v ->(laughs) The pictures, but like</v>\\n\\n135\\n00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.857\\na heightened glamorous version.\\n\\n136\\n00:06:25.857 --> 00:06:28.200\\n(Garrett laughs)\\n\\n137\\n00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.460\\nI love seeing the contrast between those two things\\n\\n138\\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.473\\nand they're your dream and then the reality made.\\n\\n139\\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.529\\nYeah, I think that is one of the great thrills for me\\n\\n140\\n00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.373\\nseeing it when it comes to life.\\n\\n141\\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.663\\nYeah.\\n\\n142\\n00:06:43.663 --> 00:06:46.020\\n<v ->And in between that there's a lot of frustration, tears.</v>\\n\\n143\\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.200\\nAnd, \"This isn't going to work.\"\\n\\n144\\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.033\\n<v ->Yeah, there's a lot.</v>\\n\\n145\\n00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:51.333\\nThere's a lot of failures, trial and error, you know.\\n\\n146\\n00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:54.212\\n(both laughs)\\n\\n147\\n00:06:54.212 --> 00:06:57.379 line:15% \\n(gentle bright music)\\n\\n148\\n00:07:13.573 --> 00:07:16.323\\n(car doors thud)\\n\\n",

Their playful and performative portraits evoke glamour, queerness, magic and androgynous freedom. \\n\\nThe self portraits _Smalltown Boy (Surfers Paradise)_ and _Smalltown Boy (Perth)_ are from a series in which the artists recreated retro postcards as tributes to their shared experiences of growing up queer in suburban Australia, and to imaginatively enact what it might have been like if they met each other as teenagers. Self-described as a â€˜dreaming of each otherâ€™, the portraits imagine a multiverse where past and present collide, where they are both adults and their younger selves. The two are â€˜joined by a sequin string heartâ€™ that bridges the 4000-kilometre distance that separated them for so long.",

                            "- It was so successful, we just got asked to do lots of things together and we didn't even call ourselves The Huxleys. People would say, \"Oh, the Huxleys are here. Who are these, Huxleys?\" So everything just happened. It wasn't really planned.\\n\\n- When we started making art, no art places took us seriously. We tried to show in galleries to represent us and tried to get the art community behind us and no one was interested. And we were just like, \"We love doing this enough that we're just going to put it out into the world.\" And we kept making things on our own, funding our own projects, doing it because we loved it. And eventually people catch up with you and you know, a lot of people ask us, \"Do you make your own things?\" And we're like, \"Where else would we find these?\" And I think by the fact that you're not trained, or neither of us are trained is a good thing because it allows you to dream bigger. Otherwise you might say, \"That can't be created.\"\\n\\n- You're not confined by any rules and you make things that other people will be like, \"Oh, you can't do that.\" And you just find a way, so you just do it. And I've had fashion designers look at my work and go, \"How did you do this,\" or, \"How do you get into it?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, this way and that way.\" But you just don't have any rules in your head.\\n\\n- Garrett and I decided to make a series of work called \"Postcards from the Edge.\" And these are postcards from the areas and the places that we grew up in. So Garrett is from the Gold Coast and I am from Perth. And we went on this journey where we tried to find and source postcards from the area and the places that exactly places that we were in as children.\\n\\n- Yeah, and by taking yourself back to that time as you are now, I felt the same as, you know, when I was 12 in that situation even though I wasn't you know, painted in green, glitter, and had wigs. I felt like that. And I completely felt like that so it was nice, you know, bringing those two worlds together.\\n\\n- And one thing that we did that was nice with the postcards is this two postcards called \"Small Town Boy: Perth\" and \"Small Town Boy: Gold Coast.\" Where we actually meet and we're joined by a sequin string of heart between us. And it was our idea that wouldn't it been wonderful if we had actually met from those places. And it's a way of us coming together. We did a thing together maybe five years ago, it was called \"People of Letters.\" We wrote letters from the time when we were struggling, growing up in these places to each other, like dreaming of each other. And it was so beautiful because it was just like the idea that you could have someone that would make you feel okay for who you were at that time. Like, if I had met Garrett when I was in school, I think my life would've been a lot easier. And that was something that, yeah.\\n\\n- And it's been nice since we've met each other and being together, we go back to Perth and the Gold Coast. And in a place that you used to get yelled at for being gay, being called poof, or whatever. You know, people are like, \"I like your outfit.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, this is nice.\" You know, things are changing which is really beautiful.\\n\\n- The idea of masking is fascinating to me because it creates this almost anonymous, we could be anyone or anything underneath that mask. And it gives this sense of freedom. For me I love the idea that it takes away, you know, wearing costumes that hide your identity. It takes away gender and it takes away race and class and all these things that were divided and put into binaries. And once you become this creation, it's so freeing and I couldn't get up and perform as well, obviously, it would be terrifying. But when I'm at an amazing costume and makeup and wigs, it creates this diversion that allows me to be the most fantastical escapist version of myself possible. It gives me the confidence.\\n\\n- Yeah, I think wearing the mask came from not wanting to be seen first, so hiding behind the mask. 'Cause I grew up very shy and still am quite shy and introverted. And I find it more interesting to look at as well. I find something like that more interesting. But you develop something in you, you find a power or something that isn't you. It's a freedom, you escape from all these constraints on yourself. So there is something really liberating about performing not as yourself, but as these characters that you've created in a way, but it's still you, you know.\\n\\n- In costume, generally it always interested me. Even like, people, military, or any kind of costume, you're putting on something to go out in the world and do a role and do something that you maybe not when you're at home.\\n\\n- Well, what's interesting, when we make our costumes, we don't know who's going to pop out in a way. And it's just so interesting, like you think, \"Oh my God, I can't believe I'm this frantic character inside this costume. Didn't expect this.\" And yeah, the latest ones we know something's going to happen. We put the latest costumes on and we're like, \"Oh, this is slow.\" You know, there's a slow kind of graceful people that are happening at the moment. It's really exciting.\\n\\n- We call it from page to stage. We love the drawings that we do when we come up with an idea. So basically, I mean neither us are very good drawers. I'm particularly bad, but they're like childlike drawings of either like a photographic scene or a costume. And it's amazing when you take that childlike drawing and then bring it into a reality. I love that transformation. And the costumes often end up looking like me.\\n\\n- They look like, the pictures.\\n\\n- The pictures, but like a heightened glamorous version. I love seeing the contrast between those two things and they're your dream and then the reality made. Yeah, I think that is one of the great thrills for me seeing it when it comes to life. Yeah.\\n\\n- And in between that there's a lot of frustration, tears. And, \"This isn't going to work.\"\\n\\n- Yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot of failures, trial and error, you know.",

are postcards from the areas and the places\\n\\n35\\n00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.620\\nthat we grew up in.\\n\\n36\\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.910\\nSo Garrett is from the Gold Coast and I am from Perth.\\n\\n37\\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.550\\nAnd we went on this journey where we tried to find\\n\\n38\\n00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.840\\nand source postcards from the area and the places\\n\\n39\\n00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.580\\nthat exactly places that we were in as children.\\n\\n40\\n00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.790\\n<v ->Yeah, and by taking yourself back to that time</v>\\n\\n41\\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.360\\nas you are now, I felt the same as, you know,\\n\\n42\\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.490\\nwhen I was 12 in that situation even though I wasn't\\n\\n43\\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.930\\nyou know, painted in green, glitter, and had wigs.\\n\\n44\\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.247\\nI felt like that.\\n\\n45\\n00:02:06.247 --> 00:02:10.600\\nAnd I completely felt like that so it was nice, you know,\\n\\n46\\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.030\\nbringing those two worlds together.\\n\\n47\\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.880\\n<v ->And one thing that we did that was nice with the postcards</v>\\n\\n48\\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.220\\nis this two postcards called \"Small Town Boy: Perth\"\\n\\n49\\n00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.080\\nand \"Small Town Boy: Gold Coast.\"\\n\\n50\\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.630\\nWhere we actually meet and we're joined\\n\\n51\\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.750\\nby a sequin string of heart between us.\\n\\n52\\n00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.580\\nAnd it was our idea that wouldn't it been wonderful\\n\\n53\\n00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.260\\nif we had actually met from those places.\\n\\n54\\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.743\\nAnd it's a way of us coming together.\\n\\n55\\n00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.840\\nWe did a thing together maybe five years ago,\\n\\n56\\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.310\\nit was called \"People of Letters.\"\\n\\n57\\n00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.210\\nWe wrote letters from the time when we were struggling,\\n\\n58\\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.370\\ngrowing up in these places to each other,\\n\\n59\\n00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.060\\nlike dreaming of each other.\\n\\n60\\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.040\\nAnd it was so beautiful because it was just like the idea\\n\\n61\\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.047\\nthat you could have someone that would make you feel okay\\n\\n62\\n00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:02.653\\nfor who you were at that time.\\n\\n63\\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.590\\nLike, if I had met Garrett when I was in school,\\n\\n64\\n00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.290\\nI think my life would've been a lot easier.\\n\\n65\\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.900\\nAnd that was something that, yeah.\\n\\n66\\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.660\\n<v ->And it's been nice since we've met each other</v>\\n\\n67\\n00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.780\\nand being together, we go back to Perth and the Gold Coast.\\n\\n68\\n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.050\\nAnd in a place that you used to get yelled at for being gay,\\n\\n69\\n00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.200\\nbeing called poof, or whatever.\\n\\n70\\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.490\\nYou know, people are like, \"I like your outfit.\"\\n\\n71\\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.060\\nAnd I'm like, \"Okay, this is nice.\"\\n\\n72\\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.860\\nYou know, things are changing which is really beautiful.\\n\\n73\\n00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:35.310\\n(bright upbeat music)\\n\\n74\\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.700\\n<v ->The idea of masking is fascinating to me</v>\\n\\n75\\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.530\\nbecause it creates this almost anonymous,\\n\\n76\\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.240\\nwe could be anyone or anything underneath that mask.\\n\\n77\\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.210\\nAnd it gives this sense of freedom.\\n\\n78\\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.570\\nFor me I love the idea that it takes away, you know,\\n\\n79\\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.180\\nwearing costumes that hide your identity.\\n\\n80\\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.910\\nIt takes away gender and it takes away race and class\\n\\n81\\n00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.570\\nand all these things that were divided\\n\\n82\\n00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.400\\nand put into binaries.\\n\\n83\\n00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.330\\nAnd once you become this creation, it's so freeing\\n\\n84\\n00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.670\\nand I couldn't get up and perform as well, obviously,\\n\\n85\\n00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.280\\nit would be terrifying.\\n\\n86\\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.280\\nBut when I'm at an amazing costume and makeup and wigs,\\n\\n87\\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.460\\nit creates this diversion that allows me\\n\\n88\\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.230\\nto be the most fantastical escapist version\\n\\n89\\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.050\\nof myself possible.\\n\\n90\\n00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.284\\nIt gives me the confidence.\\n\\n91\\n00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:29.290\\n<v ->Yeah, I think wearing the mask came from not wanting</v>\\n\\n92\\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.160\\nto be seen first, so hiding behind the mask.\\n\\n93\\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.990\\n'Cause I grew up very shy and still am\\n\\n94\\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.440\\nquite shy and introverted.\\n\\n95\\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.460\\nAnd I find it more interesting to look at as well.\\n\\n96\\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.940\\nI find something like that more interesting.\\n\\n97\\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.530\\nBut you develop something in you, you find a power\\n\\n98\\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.300\\nor something that isn't you.\\n\\n99\\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.870\\nIt's a freedom, you escape from all these constraints\\n\\n100\\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.150\\non yourself.\\n\\n101\\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.490\\nSo there is something really liberating about performing\\n\\n102\\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.110\\nnot as yourself, but as these characters that you've created\\n\\n103\\n00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.267\\nin a way, but it's still you, you know.

                            "Multidisciplinary creative researcher Brenda L Croft is from the Gurindji/Malngin/Mudburra Peoples from the Victoria River region in the Northern Territory, with Anglo-Australian/German/Irish/Chinese/Scottish heritage. Croftâ€™s tintype photographs enlist a 19th-century photographic technique to reclaim ownership over representation. Often photographing extraordinary people within her network, Croft invites the subject to stare directly into the camera, and in turn meet the viewerâ€™s gaze. This eye contact is an act of empowerment and self-determination by the subject that becomes a form of encounter, pulling the viewer into the image. \\n\\nThis photograph is a tender self portrait of artist and child that bears witness to the closeness between the pair. Across generations the two care for one another with respect for the bloodlines of inherited lineage. Christopher embraces Brenda in a moment of connection. Creating a link with his arms that hold her in an infinite loop, the two are bonded as one in body and spirit. Speaking of her relationship with Christopher, Croft says: â€˜It is a gift to share Christopherâ€™s life and I learn from him every day â€“ blood/memory. Marntaj.â€™",

Burney was the first First Nations person to be admitted to New South Wales Parliament and the first First Nations woman to serve in the House of Representatives. Burney is resolute in her commitment to the prevention of domestic violence and family violence. \\n\\nBurney and Riley were close friends, and he lived with Burney in Leichardt when Binni was young. Rileyâ€™s tender portrait shows the bond between mother and child. As Burney later recalled: â€˜Looking at those pictures has taken me back to the early 80s when we were all so young, and really had no sense of the enormous lives that some of us would have â€¦ Michael had an enormous influence on both my children. He was their uncle, and a connection between Michael and my children is very strong, so itâ€™s a very, very special photograph. And I remember Michael getting us to pose for that photograph. And I had no idea that it would become such an enduring image of the beauty that he could make.â€™",

                            "Linda and Binni by Wiradjuri/Kamileroi artist Michael Riley is from the series Michael Riley Portraits 1984 to 1990. It is a black and white photograph taken in 1984 and printed in 2013. An inkjet print on paper, it measures 43.1 centimetres high and 54 centimetres wide.  \\nLinda is educator, activist and politician Linda Burney, a Wiradjuri woman, with her young son Binni. It is an intimate head and shoulders portrait of a young mother holding her baby against her body. Binni nestles into his motherâ€™s left shoulder as she faces forward. Binniâ€™s back is to us as Linda supports his neck and head with her slender left hand.\\n\\nGentle diffused light washes over the portrait from her left casting the right-hand side of Lindaâ€™s head and face into deep shadow. The contrast of light and shade emphasizes the physical connection between mother and baby.\\n\\nLinda has a downward tilt to her head. She has short, slightly wavy, thick dark hair with a right-hand part. She has fine dark eyebrows over downcast eyes with shadowed lids and long lashes. She has faint lines either side of her nose and her lips are slightly upturned with a hint of a smile.\\n\\nLindaâ€™s chin rests against Binniâ€™s left shoulder and his dimpled bent left elbow peaks beneath her chin. Lindaâ€™s right shoulder fades into the dark background.  \\nThere is a sense of stillness and calm. \\n\\n**Audio description script written and vocied by Krysia Kitch**",

                            "<span>Linda Burney:</span>\\n\\n<span>Looking at those pictures has taken me back to the early 80s when we were all so young, and really had no sense of the enormous lives that some of us would have. You know, it was a very different place for Aboriginal people in the 80s, but it was also a time when things were really starting to happen. I think what those photographs really demonstrate to me is a radical re-look at the way that Aboriginal people were being represented.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>I also look at every individual in the series â€“ all of them that I know, some of them that I am still very much in contact with â€“ and just think there was an alignment of the stars to bring us all together.</span>\\n\\n<span>Michael had an enormous influence on both my children. He was their uncle, and a connection between Michael and my children is very strong, so it's a very, very special photograph. And I remember Michael getting us to pose for that photograph. And I had no idea that it would become such an enduring image of the beauty that he could make.</span>\\n\\n<span>Brenda Croft:</span>\\n\\n<span>The image that day that he did with me and Dad... I can still remember that Dad's shirt had a big coffee stain on it, where he'd tipped his coffee on him. It didn't take very long. He just came in, took photographs. And I just, I love that image. You know, we used to go along to all the exhibitions that were on, around the traps. And Dad was there because he was friends with Ace, and Dad's, not bragging, but he was just really proud. And he was going 'Oh, you know, you've got to come to Michael's opening tomorrow night because you'll see an image ofÂ me and Brenda in it. Then Dad sort of wanders off somewhere and Michael's [under his breath] \"Brenda, Brenda, come 'ere, come 'ere\" and I went over and said \"What, what\" and he said 'I haven't printed it. What'll I do?\" And I just said, you know, \"Well if you want to make an old man happy, you'd better print it. So we did. We spent the entire night printing it in Sandy Edwards' studio, printing it by hand. So we framed it and and â€“ lucky for him â€“ Dad bought it at the opening.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>Darrell Sibosado:</span>\\n\\n<span>I actually love that image. For me, personally, it's one of the best photos I've seen of myself. It's the image that reflects me from that time, makes me think about it, you know, who I was at that time.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>So that day, I remember it was a bit organised. I kept saying yesterday I remember how disorganised Michael seemed. But this was a bit of a plan. But anyway, it was on the first floor, and we were in there, and it was quite simple. There was just him with a camera. He was so comfortable to be around. You know, even though he was quiet and everything, you knew it was a good quiet. It wasn't a quiet where he's thinking you're an idiot or anything like that. You know he's not thinking bad thoughts. And I just trusted him to do whatever he wants. So I just sat there and he took the photo and that's what came out.</span>",

The series presents a glimpse of the Sudanese-Australian model and her family at home in Adelaide. Adut was born in South Sudan and spent the first several years of her life in the UNâ€™s Kakuma refugee camp in north-west Kenya after her family fled from civil war. They later came to Australia and settled in Adelaide in 2008. Adutâ€™s break-out modelling assignment came at the age of 16, when she walked the runway for Yves Saint Laurent at Paris Fashion Week 2016. In 2017, she became only the second woman of colour to model bridal gowns for Chanel. The following year she featured in the Pirelli calendar and made 33 appearances at Paris Fashion Week. Adut was selected by the Duchess of Sussex to feature in British _Vogueâ€™s_ â€˜Forces for Changeâ€™ edition in 2019, which profiled her activism on humanitarian issues, notably the rights of asylum seekers, and racial and gender equality.",

                            "A life like sculpture of Tasmanian Palawa leader, Trucaninny, by Benjamin Law, made in 1836. The three dimensional, cast plaster bust is slightly smaller than lifesize. Approx 60 cm high, 40 cm wide and 25 cm deep, Trucaninnyâ€™s bust depicts her head and torso and ends, cropped at her upper arm. The bust is painted jet black, which has a low sheen and is mounted on a cast plaster stand, or socle, which is also black. The simple squat cylindrical stand has a curvaceous form â€“ rounded collar, narrower stem and wider base. \\n\\nHer hair is short with tight curls. Her head is tilted slightly downwards. Her solemn face is broad with strong features. She has a short forehead, strong brow and deep-set eyes. Her gaze is intense. Her prominent cheekbones, either side of her broad nose, give her cheeks a rounded appearance in contrast to the deep-set eyes. She has a full mouth, with an emphasis on the cleft running between her nose and upper lip. She holds her mouth closed, and this, together with her fixed gaze, gives Trucaninny a quiet fortitude. Her square chin is asymmetrical, with an indent slightly left-of-centre. \\n\\nAround her neck, Trucaninny wears a necklace of tiny conical maireener shells laced together. The necklace lies flat against her skin with the narrow ends of the shells pointing outwards. The long strand is wound around her neck twice, resting on her collarbone and lower in the centre of her chest. \\n\\nTrucaninnyâ€™s shoulders are rolled forwards slightly, matching the downward tilt of her head and the direction of her gaze. From her right shoulder, draped low across her chest and under her left arm she wears an animal skin. The skin, irregular in shape, is twisted around itself, gaping to reveal her right breast and nipple. The drapes and folds show both sides of the animal skin â€“ the thick furred texture in contrast with the smooth underside. A triangle of fur hangs long over her right breast and past the end of the bust.",

                            "American opera singer, Henry Squires (1825â€“1907), performed in Australia and New Zealand throughout the 1860s as part of William Saurin Lysterâ€™s Grand Opera Company. Known for his 'legitimate head tones and skilfully managed falsetto notes', Squires appeared in over 1300 performances during his eight year stay, the majority of which he performed in leading roles with his future wife, prima donna di forza, Lucy Escott. Born in 1825 in Bennington, Vermont, Squires trained as a professional singer under the instruction of church organist and early in his career appeared in New York with divas such as the 'Swedish Nightingale', Jenny Lind, and renowned soprano, Lucy Escott. In 1852, he went on to perform in Italy, becoming known as the 'first American singer to have achieved a career on an Italian stage' and later sang with J. H Tully's National English Opera company. Arriving in Australia in 1861, he debuted alongside Escott Lucia di Lammermoor at the Theatre Royal in Melbourne. Lyster's company proved popular with audiences, performing six nights a week with a repertoire of operas in Italian, German and English. Possessing 'handsome stage presence and a beautiful bel canto voice', Squires was an immediate favourite with Melbourne audiences and, along with Escott, was said to have rivalled Nellie Melba in making opera a form of mass entertainment in Australia. Though audiences called for Squires to 'infuse more animation into his acting', he possessed a 'beautiful mezza voce' and was considered as 'great a draw as the prima donna'. After nearly twenty years of working together, Squires and Escott married in May 1870 and retired to Paris. Squires returned to the USA following Escott's death and died in Iowa in January 1907.\\n\\nEdwin Dalton (active 1853â€“1865), artist and photographer, arrived in Victoria in the early 1850s having exhibited on occasion with the Royal Academy since 1818. In London, he had trained and worked with painter Sir William Ross, whose artistâ€“sister Magdalena Dalton married. In Melbourne, he established himself as a portrait painter, exhibiting with the Victoria Fine Arts' Society in 1853 and in the Melbourne Exhibition in 1854. He added photography to his repertoire after moving to Sydney where, in 1858, he opened his 'Royal Photographic Establishment' at 400 George Street.

                            "Lucy Escott (1828â€“1895), soprano, spent several years in Australia during the 1860s as a member of William Saurin Lyster's touring opera company. Born Lucy Evans Grant in Springfield, Massachusetts, Escott is said to have shown promise from an early age, such that she was sent abroad for tuition with an Italian professore. â€˜After acquiring experience and confidence in the various opera houses of Italyâ€™, Escott went to London and thence on to engagements in â€˜the principal cities of the United Kingdom.â€™ Following an American tour she and the Vermont-born tenor Henry Squires were signed by Lyster for a jaunt around the Australian colonies which kicked off in Melbourne in March 1861 and ended up lasting eight years. Lyster's company became a favourite with audiences, the singers performing six nights a week in a repertoire of operas in Italian, German and English. Escott was the company's prima donna and headline act, touted as 'a vocalist and actress of the very first order of merit, possessing a voice and a power of execution equal to that of the most celebrated artistes.â€™ She and Squires married after leaving Australia and retired to an abode in Paris, where Escott is said to have â€˜devoted herself to the study of painting and sculpture with as much energy as she had previously infused into her operatic work.â€™ She died in Paris following a bout of pneumonia and â€˜by her own desireâ€™ was cremated at PÃ©re Lachaise.\\n\\nEdwin Dalton (active 1853â€“1865), artist and photographer, arrived in Victoria in the early 1850s having exhibited on occasion with the Royal Academy since 1818. In London, he had trained and worked with painter Sir William Ross, whose artistâ€“sister Magdalena Dalton married. In Melbourne, he established himself as a portrait painter, exhibiting with the Victoria Fine Artsâ€™ Society in 1853 and in the Melbourne Exhibition in 1854. He added photography to his repertoire after moving to Sydney where, in 1858, he opened his â€˜Royal Photographic Establishmentâ€™ at 400 George Street. By 1861 he was offering â€˜photographic portraiture in all the modern branches â€“ crayon, ivory, glass and paper â€“ artistically coloured by E. Dalton, formerly painter and instructor to the Queenâ€™. Daltonâ€™s cartes de visite of Henry Squires and Lucy Escott were among the many portraits of local and international personages advertised as being available from Sydney stationer J.R. Clarke in December 1862 for two shillings each (or 21 shillings per dozen).

                            "Thomas Sutcliffe Mort (1816â€“1878) was one of nineteenth- century Sydneyâ€™s most prominent businessmen. Born in Lancashire and raised in Manchester, Mort emigrated to New South Wales in 1838, believing that the colony presented â€˜a better opening for his industrious habits and his business abilities than there was in the land of his birthâ€™. Within five years he had started his own business as an auctioneer of wool and other commodities â€“ a profession for which his â€˜suavity of demeanour, and imperturbable good temper, rendered him eminently fitâ€™. By 1850, he was the premier auctioneer in Sydney and had interests in insurance, agriculture, railway and mining ventures, among others. But he is perhaps most remembered for other initiatives, such as the dairy farms he operated on the estate he acquired at Bodalla in 1860; and the dry dock he helped to establish at Balmain in 1855, which he progressed from shipbuilding to locomotive production and general engineering. He also funded experiments in freezing and refrigeration technology, forming the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company in 1875. Mort donated some of his substantial wealth to community causes, contributing to the building of Sydneyâ€™s St Andrewâ€™s Cathedral and the Universityâ€™s St Paulâ€™s College. Following his death in May 1878, the city marked its esteem for him with a statue in Macquarie Place and Balmainâ€™s Mort Bay was named in his honour.\\n\\nTheresa Shepheard Mort (nÃ©e Laidley, 1820â€“1869) was eight years old when she came to Sydney, her father, James Laidley (1786â€“1835) having been appointed to the position of deputy commissary general. The eldest of eight children, she was educated at home and received art lessons from Conrad Martens and the ex-convict portraitist, Charles Rodius. Theresa was around twenty-one when she married Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, and twenty-three when her first child, James Laidley Mort, was born. Theresa had eight more children over the next seventeen years; seven of them survived to adulthood. She spent much of her married life at Greenoaks, the Darling Point home established by Mort in 1843. Theresa has been described as a devoted wife and mother and Thomas was devastated by her death from cancer at the age of forty-nine. Mort, however, later remarried, and was to have two more sons before he died.",

                            "A portrait of businessman Thomas Sutcliffe Mort and his wife Theresa, by an unknown artist, created in 1847. Daguerreotype photograph mounted in a copper coloured frame inside a protective case, measuring 8 cm in height and 7 cm wide. \\n\\nThis photograph has a mirror-like finish, the image is a range of grey shades. At certain angles the image disappears turning into a solid silver background. On moving, the image reveals itself again. Theresa is seated on the left, with Thomas on the right, against a blank wall with a square wooden table placed between them. An upturned top hat and a book are positioned on the table. \\n\\nTheresa has a severe middle part in her hair. Coiled ringlets frame her face and brush against her shoulders. She has an oval-shaped face with a serious expression, with lowered eyebrows over almond-shaped eyes, a broad nose and full closed lips. Her left arm leans upon the table, fingers curled over to rest against her chin. She wears a lace-collared, long velvet cloak over a full-length long-sleeved dress, with a silk-like sheen, which ends in a deep ruffle. A straw bonnet decorated with velvet bands and a bow lies on her lap. \\n\\nThomas has luscious thick wavy hair, swept over in a right-side part and curling around his ears. He also has a serious expression, deep set and heavy-lidded eyes set over a large straight nose and unsmiling lips. His right forearm rests on the book placed on the table, fingers hanging off the edge, with a ring on his little finger. His left arm rests against his thigh. He wears a high-collared shirt with necktie. A dark double-breasted jacket is buttoned closed, ending mid-thigh. Light trousers cover his legs. His right leg is bent at the knee with his left stretching out in a more relaxed pose. \\n\\nThere are some marks on the surface of the photograph particularly on the bottom edge, slightly distorting the image.",

                            "John (c. 1846â€“1867) (left) and Thomas Clarke (c. 1840â€“1867), bushrangers, grew up near Braidwood and from a young age were schooled in nefarious activities including horse-theft. John was 17 when he first went to prison and Thomas was purported to have ridden with the infamous Ben Hall. In October 1865, Thomas escaped from gaol while awaiting trial for armed robbery; thereafter, aided by various mates, he embarked on a string of depredations around Braidwood, Araluen and further south. In April 1866, at Nerrigundah, the gang engaged in a hold-up that left a policeman dead. Thomas was outlawed in May, by which time John had joined him. Reports described them as â€˜well-mounted, and armed to the teethâ€™. In September 1866 colonial secretary Henry Parkes sent four special constables to Braidwood â€˜for the express purpose of hunting down the desperate maraudersâ€™. In January 1867, the four were murdered in an ambush at Jinden. The Clarkes were blamed immediately and the authorities offered rewards of Â£1000 each, alive or dead. Aided by an effective bush telegraph system, the brothers evaded capture until April 1867, when they were tracked to a hideout near Araluen, apprehended, and taken to Braidwood Gaol. There, an as yet unidentified photographer took portraits that were sold by a Goulburn bookseller for two shillings and sixpence each. The brothers were later tried in Sydney before Sir Alfred Stephen, who in sentencing them to death noted the more than 60 offences, excluding murders, of which they were suspected.",

                            "Rosina Carandini (1844â€“1932) was one of the five daughters of Jerome Carandini, Marquis of Sarzano (1803â€“1870), an Italian political exile, and his wife Marie (nÃ©e Burgess, 1826â€“1894), better known as the esteemed singer â€˜Madame Carandiniâ€™. Born in Hobart, Rosina and her sister Fannie (1850â€“1904) began their singing training early, their fatherâ€™s straitened circumstances and their motherâ€™s dominance and ambition determining that they would have careers on the musical stage. The sisters performed alongside their mother in the 1860s as the â€˜Carandini Family Troupeâ€™, touring widely and earning the warm approbation of audiences. One report of a performance in Bendigo in 1869 noted the â€˜power, sweetness, and purityâ€™ of Fannieâ€™s voice and stated that the sisters â€˜were very successful in a number of duetsâ€™. Their rendition of â€˜Beware! Beware! I trust her notâ€™, according to the report, â€˜proved very laughter provoking, and had to be repeated in answer to an enthusiastic encoreâ€™. Rosina also performed as a principal soloist on several occasions, winning much respect and admiration. When Prince Alfred visited Melbourne in 1868 he was so impressed with Rosina that he promised to make it possible for her to study in Europe. The opportunity, however, was one of many that she declined so as not to transgress notions of acceptable behaviour for married women. She later worked as a music teacher and on her death in 1932 was remembered as the leading Australian soprano of her era. \\n\\nPhotographer Charles Hewitt was working in Melbourne by 1860 and was one of the founding members of the Photographic Society of Victoria. Initially he was in business with Charles Nettleton, but by 1866, when examples of his work were included in the Melbourne Intercolonial Exhibition, he was working independently. He occupied a studio at 95 Swanston Street from 1867, in which year the â€˜Misses Carandiniâ€™ performed in Melbourne several times, including in the â€˜Charitable Music Festivalâ€™ at the Exhibition Building in April. Hewittâ€™s portraits of the sisters would in all likelihood have been created to coincide with one such performance. Rosina is depicted in a day dress with deepened waistline, full-length sleeves and high neckline, while Fannie wears an off-the-shoulder, bell-shaped dress, more suited to evening attire. Their full skirts are worn over a cage crinoline with a boned corset tightened over a chemise in typical mid-nineteenth century fashion. They wear their hair with a central part and swept back from the face to form a chignon. Both are adorned with braided hair chains, worn with sisterly sentiment, complimenting the lace trimmings on their frocks, decorative belts and ornamented surrounds.",

                            "Fannie Carandini (1850â€“1904) was one of the five daughters of Jerome Carandini, Marquis of Sarzano (1803â€“1870), an Italian political exile, and his wife Marie (nÃ©e Burgess, 1826â€“1894), better known as the esteemed singer â€˜Madame Carandiniâ€™. Born in Hobart, Fannie and her oldest sister Rosina (1844â€“1932) began their singing training early, their fatherâ€™s straitened circumstances and their motherâ€™s dominance and ambition determining that they would have careers on the musical stage. The sisters performed alongside their mother in the 1860s as the â€˜Carandini Family Troupeâ€™, touring widely and earning the warm approbation of audiences. One report of a performance in Bendigo in 1869 noted the â€˜power, sweetness, and purityâ€™ of Fannieâ€™s voice and stated that the sisters â€˜were very successful in a number of duetsâ€™. Their rendition of â€˜Beware! Beware! I trust her notâ€™, according to the report, â€˜proved very laughter provoking, and had to be repeated in answer to an enthusiastic encoreâ€™. Rosina also performed as a principal soloist on several occasions, winning much respect and admiration. When Prince Alfred visited Melbourne in 1868 he was so impressed with Rosina that he promised to make it possible for her to study in Europe. The opportunity, however, was one of many that she declined so as not to transgress notions of acceptable behaviour for married women. Fannie married in India in 1875 and eventually moved to England. Darwinâ€™s Fannie Bay and its namesake suburb are held to be named after her, having been surveyed in 1868 by men whoâ€™d heard her sing in Adelaide a few weeks earlier.\\n\\nPhotographer Charles Hewitt was working in Melbourne by 1860 and was one of the founding members of the Photographic Society of Victoria. Initially he was in business with Charles Nettleton, but by 1866, when examples of his work were included in the Melbourne Intercolonial Exhibition, he was working independently. He occupied a studio at 95 Swanston Street from 1867, in which year the â€˜Misses Carandiniâ€™ performed in Melbourne several times, including in the â€˜Charitable Music Festivalâ€™ at the Exhibition Building in April. Hewittâ€™s portraits of the sisters would in all likelihood have been created to coincide with one such performance. Rosina is depicted in a day dress with deepened waistline, full-length sleeves and high neckline, while Fannie wears an off-the-shoulder, bell-shaped dress, more suited to evening attire. Their full skirts are worn over a cage crinoline with a boned corset tightened over a chemise in typical mid-nineteenth century fashion. They wear their hair with a central part and swept back from the face to form a chignon. Both are adorned with braided hair chains, worn with sisterly sentiment, complimenting the lace trimmings on their frocks, decorative belts and ornamented surrounds.",

                            "William Yang is a pre-eminent Australian photographer known for his intensely sustained body of work that examines cultural and sexual identity, and unflinchingly documents his own lived experience with curiosity, sensitivity and humour. _Miscellaneous Obsessions #1, Bondi_ â€“ a scene in which Yang, reading and seated on a heavily patterned floral couch, seems oblivious to the unnamed, satyr-like naked man draped provocatively behind him â€“ is part of a broader archive of images that capture the Sydney LGBTQIA+ community, from the early days of the gay liberation movement in the 1970s to the present day. An expression of queer joy, the work is both performative and candid, and, as in so much of Yangâ€™s work, its power can be found in its directness. This is both a staged moment and a quiet everyday one.",

                            "I had to come to terms with being Chinese, being gay, and just feeling comfortable as a human being. There are lots of people who aren't comfortable about that, still. And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. That's been my philosophy. I never consciously came out as a gay man, I was swept out by events at the time. And that was exactly what happened to me in the 70s. I was in the closet when I was in Brisbane, I came to Sydney in 1969. People were starting to come out in the early 70s, and suddenly there was this whole connection of gay people with each other, and it was really quite exciting. I also then became a photographer in Sydney as well.\\n\\nGenerally, my style of photography is I'm just photographing what's around me in my everyday life. At the time, I was living at Martin Sharp's mansion in Bellevue Hill and Peter Allen came to visit him. Peter was in town and he'd heard that this was a place that he should visit. He'd never met Martin before. And so he just came, to visit. I'd met Peter a few times before, just around the traps. I wouldn't say I got to know him well, but well enough to get that snap of him. So I was brushing shoulders with celebrities at that time. And I met Mel Gibson at one of the parties. And he asked me if I'd take a photograph of him because he needed a card. His parents, they used to answer all his fan mail and they needed a card to say \"best wishes from Mel\" or something, and answer their question. So he got me to do it. And so that's how I took those photographs of Mel. Patrick White never wanted to be interviewed, he never wanted to be photographed. But in this particular case, with the portrait that's in the gallery, Brett Whitely wanted to paint his portrait, I think for the Archibald. And Brett asked me, if I could photograph him so he could get a set of photographs of him. There was a rumour going around that I was the only person who Patrick would allow to photograph him, which wasn't true. But anyway, I never ever quashed the rumour, 'cuz it was all to my advantage. And so I took a very good set of photographs for Brett, and they were taken at Kate Fitzpatrick's place in Kings Cross, where she had a lunch to introduce Patrick to Brett.\\n\\nProbably the 80s was my most productive time and all those photographs came out, because I was brushing shoulders with celebrities. But after that period, say at the end of the 80s, I started to do self-portraits. I suppose it's was the evolution of my own story when I kind of claim my own story. And the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields, in the place where my uncle had been shot, William Fang Yuen, had been shot and I'd located that in my research of the event and I found the place. So I stood there in the cane fields and I somehow knew that this was an important event, because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event, which happened 72 years ago. But here I was, kind of retelling the story. And that was a very important thing, moment in my life. So I did that. One of the first ones in this cluster that I've got is called \"Self Portrait #2\" it came after the one of standing in the cane fields. But when I was about six years old, I'll tell you this story because almost in every interview I've ever done I've always told this story. It's become as John McDonald, the critic said, \"It's become my incantation.\"\\n\\nWhen I was six years old, one of the kids at school called me \"Ching Chong Chinaman, born in a jar, christened in a teapot. Ha, ha, ha.\" I had no idea what he was talking about, although I knew from his expression he was being horrible to me. So I went home to my mother and I said to her, \"Mom, I'm not Chinese, am I?\" And she said, \"Yes, you are.\" Her tone was hard, and it shocked me. And I knew in that moment, that being Chinese was like a terrible curse. And I could not rely on my mother for help. Or my brother, who was four years older than me, very much more experienced in the world. He chimed in, \"And you'd better get used to it.\" I claim my heritage in the 80s, because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged. I'm very happy that that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so, I feel that I'm living my art as well as my life. And so that's very satisfying for me.\\n\\nThen I'd done performance pieces, telling the personal story and realising that many of the images had stories. I realised that the handwriting makes my work more unique - my very handwriting. And so I've chosen more recently photographs that have got a story, which I can write on. And so that's usually a bit of a preference for me when choosing a photograph.",

--> 00:02:29.460\\nto say \"best wishes from Mel\" or something,\\n\\n38\\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.570\\nand answer their question.\\n\\n39\\n00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.910\\nSo he got me to do it.\\n\\n40\\n00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.183\\nAnd so that's how I took those photographs of Mel.\\n\\n41\\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.240\\nPatrick White never wanted to be interviewed,\\n\\n42\\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.493\\nhe never wanted to be photographed.\\n\\n43\\n00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.900\\nBut in this particular case, with the portrait\\n\\n44\\n00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.490\\nthat's in the gallery, Brett Whitely wanted to\\n\\n45\\n00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.673\\npaint his portrait, I think for the Archibald.\\n\\n46\\n00:02:58.103 --> 00:03:02.370\\nAnd Brett asked me, if I could photograph him\\n\\n47\\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.983\\nso he could get a set of photographs of him.\\n\\n48\\n00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.280\\nThere was a rumour going around that I was the\\n\\n49\\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.480\\nonly person who Patrick would allow to photograph him,\\n\\n50\\n00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.070\\nwhich wasn't true.\\n\\n51\\n00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.830\\nBut anyway, I never ever quashed the rumour,\\n\\n52\\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.140\\n'cuz it was all to my advantage.\\n\\n53\\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.720\\nAnd so I took a very good set of photographs\\n\\n54\\n00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.040\\nfor Brett, and they were taken at Kate Fitzpatrick's place\\n\\n55\\n00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.370\\nin Kings Cross, where she had a lunch to introduce\\n\\n56\\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.663\\nPatrick to Brett.\\n\\n57\\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.580\\nProbably the 80s was my most productive time\\n\\n58\\n00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.810\\nand all those photographs came out, because I was\\n\\n59\\n00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.960\\nbrushing shoulders with celebrities.\\n\\n60\\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.960\\nBut after that period, say at the end of the 80s,\\n\\n61\\n00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.750\\nI started to do self-portraits.\\n\\n62\\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.400\\nI suppose it's was the evolution of my own story\\n\\n63\\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.400\\nwhen I kind of claim my own story.\\n\\n64\\n00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.540\\nAnd the very first self-portrait was me\\n\\n65\\n00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.160\\nstanding in the cane fields, in the place where my uncle had\\n\\n66\\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.120\\nbeen shot, William Fang Yuen, had been shot and\\n\\n67\\n00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.810\\nI'd located that in my research of the event\\n\\n68\\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.130\\nand I found the place.\\n\\n69\\n00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.490\\nSo I stood there in the cane fields and\\n\\n70\\n00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.360\\nI somehow knew that this was an important event,\\n\\n71\\n00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.360\\nbecause the past and the present had somehow come together\\n\\n72\\n00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.630\\nin this event, which happened 72 years ago.\\n\\n73\\n00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.263\\nBut here I was, kind of retelling the story.\\n\\n74\\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.570\\nAnd that was a very important thing, moment in my life.\\n\\n75\\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.653\\nSo I did that.\\n\\n76\\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.410\\nOne of the first ones in this cluster that I've got\\n\\n77\\n00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.820\\nis called \"Self Portrait #2\" it came after the one of\\n\\n78\\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.563\\nstanding in the cane fields.\\n\\n79\\n00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.790\\nBut when I was about six years old, I'll tell you this story\\n\\n80\\n00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.900\\nbecause almost in every interview I've ever done\\n\\n81\\n00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.573\\nI've always told this story.\\n\\n82\\n00:05:09.573 --> 00:05:13.147\\nIt's become as John McDonald, the critic said,\\n\\n83\\n00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:16.047\\n\"It's become my incantation.\"\\n\\n84\\n00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.130\\nWhen I was six years old, one of the kids at school\\n\\n85\\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.277\\ncalled me \"Ching Chong Chinaman, born in a jar,\\n\\n86\\n00:05:24.277 --> 00:05:27.717\\nchristened in a teapot. Ha, ha, ha.\"\\n\\n87\\n00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.880\\nI had no idea what he was talking about, although I knew\\n\\n88\\n00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.480\\nfrom his expression he was being horrible to me.\\n\\n89\\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.027\\nSo I went home to my mother and I said to her,\\n\\n90\\n00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:43.290\\n\"Mom, I'm not Chinese, am I?\"\\n\\n91\\n00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.767\\nAnd she said, \"Yes, you are.\"\\n\\n92\\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.210\\nHer tone was hard, and it shocked me.\\n\\n93\\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.910\\nAnd I knew in that moment, that being Chinese was\\n\\n94\\n00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.340\\nlike a terrible curse.\\n\\n95\\n00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.700\\nAnd I could not rely on my mother for help.\\n\\n96\\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.420\\nOr my brother, who was four years older than me,\\n\\n97\\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.630\\nvery much more experienced in the world.\\n\\n98\\n00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.167\\nhe chimed in, \"And you'd better get used to it.\"\\n\\n99\\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.230\\nI claim my heritage in the 80s, because the Chinese part\\n\\n100\\n00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.713\\nof me was always denied and unacknowledged.\\n\\n101\\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.960\\nI'm very happy that that has happened because\\n\\n102\\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.520\\nmy life and my art have kind of joined together.\\n\\n103\\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.520\\nAnd so, I feel that I'm living my art as well as my life.\\n\\n104\\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.413\\nAnd so that's very satisfying for me.\\n\\n105\\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.720\\nThen I'd done performance pieces, telling the personal story\\n\\n106\\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.653\\nand realising that many of the images had stories.\\n\\n107\\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.670\\nI realised that the handwriting makes\\n\\n108\\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.160\\nmy work more unique.\\n\\n109\\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.310\\n- my very handwriting.\\n\\n110\\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.190\\nAnd so I've chosen more recently\\n\\n111\\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.430\\nphotographs that have got a story, which I can write on.\\n\\n112\\n00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.410\\nAnd so that's usually a bit of a preference for me\\n\\n113\\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.243\\nwhen choosing a photograph.\\n\\n114\\n00:07:16.254 --> 00:07:18.837 line:15% \\n(gentle music)\\n\\n",

                            "Set in the Wellington Botanic Gardens in Aotearoa/New Zealand, _Pollinator_ 2020 is a sensory, breathy encounter between Melbourne-based artist Laura Duffy and the â€˜naturalâ€™ world. Duffyâ€™s work often focuses on the perceived binaries of the â€˜naturalâ€™ versus the â€˜unnaturalâ€™ and how these terms have been weaponised against the queer community.\\n\\nFilmed in closeup by the artist herself, _Pollinator_ is a performance-based video in which fluid camera angles capture Duffy hovering above an array of heady blooms including lavender, rose and camellia. As the camera pans in and out, Duffy whispers the word â€˜homoâ€™ to the foliage, reclaiming the word and opening it up to interpretation. The disorienting contrast between the repetition of the derogatory term and the joyful flowers and bright colour reflects the artistâ€™s attempt to position herself in the world around her.",

Born in Brisbane, Darling studied science at the University of Queensland and undertook postgraduate study in the Medical School of Monash University. Though she worked as a scientist, her interests encompass a variety of social and cultural concerns, including art, music and health. Darling had long admired the work of photographer Anne Zahalka before she was commissioned to make this portrait. Fittingly, Zahalka photographed Darling in the Gallery, next to a bouquet of brightly coloured Australian natives in magenta, yellow and cream.",

It is a colour, photographic transparency presented in a backlit light box, with a glossy black frame, measuring 119cm tall by 82cm wide.\\n\\nAn elegant woman in her middle years in a knee-length apricot dress, heels and gold accessories. Marilyn Darling stands slightly left of centre, in the foreground, front on. The sunshine streaming in behind her creating a halo in her short, wavy, platinum blond hair.\\n\\nMarilynâ€™s face is tanned, her grey-blue eyes look straight towards us. Her vibrant coral coloured lips are upturned in a closed-mouth smile. Â¬\\n\\nShe wears gold hoop earrings, and a chunky bone and gold necklace made up of curving segments linked together, and it rests in a tight, flat ring on her collar bone. The necklace is framed by the collar of her apricot dress. Just beneath the collar, on the right, glints a small gold pin.\\n\\nMarilynâ€™s bare arms are folded across her waist. On her left hand is a gold and diamond ring, and on her wrist, a slim gold watch. Her short nails are painted the same coral as her lips. \\n\\nMarilynâ€™s dress is knee-length and her slender legs are golden. She centres her weight on her left leg, while her right leg extends out slightly to the side, both feet facing forward. She wears cream, peep-toe high-heels, and her toenails are lacquered with coral polish.\\n\\nDiagonal shadows are cast by her legs, across the foyer floor, veering to the right lower corner of the portrait. \\n\\nOn Marilyn Darlingâ€™s right, inside the gallery doors is a substantial bouquet of brightly coloured Australian native flowers, in magenta, yellow and cream amidst grey-green foliage. The flowers spring from a stainless-steel cylindrical vessel, resting on a waist high, rectangular concrete plinth. \\n\\nFurther on, there is an abundance of architectural detail, she stands just inside the doors. Triangular, pale timber at ceiling height, a line of round air conditioning vents above head height, and thin wooden vertical struts running down over glass to meet the foyer floor. The floor is pale grey stone, glistening with reflected light. \\n\\nBeyond the doors, the forecourt is flooded with bright white sunshine, and on our left is a large, bright orange sculpture. Past the sculpture is blurred greenery. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Rory Walker**",

                            "When the subject came up of a portrait of me Iâ€™d certainly had enough time to think about it, look at other portraits, but in fact I hadnâ€™t really given any thought to what I really would want. I was always thinking about other portraits.\\n\\nAnne Zahalka, Iâ€™d really admired her work, and it was Andrew who really suggested her strongly. Iâ€™d no idea what an enormous amount of equipment she would have to bring with her from Sydney. They drove, she brought a couple of assistants, and they took an enormous amount of time setting up. And then they said, well, â€œstep in for the shotâ€. But like an hour and a half later, they were still taking photographs, so as a control freak it was fantastic because there were sheets of proofs, absolutely masses. And as always, the best ones are right at the end. And I think that's often true of photography.\\n\\nIâ€™d wanted it to be really showing the building in some way, because Iâ€™d endowed the flowers, as something Iâ€™d always wanted to do, because I think museums that have got a large floral arrangement as you walk in just look fantastic. And then there was whatâ€™s of course called the orange blob, was something else that weâ€™d given. It was just a great experience. I loved every minute of it.Â Â ",

                            "The protea flower is often seen as a symbol of strength and transformation, making it a powerful allegory of hope, growth and resilience. Michael Zavrosâ€™ inclusion of the flower in his portrait of Australiaâ€™s 25th Governor-General, The Hon Dame Quentin Bryce AD CVO (b. 1942) is deeply intentional. The flower has personal significance for Bryce as it is the emblem of the Special Taskforce on Domestic and Family Violence in Queensland, which she chaired from 2014â€“15. The presence of this bloom is a poignant connection to the work Bryce was doing at that time. As she reveals, the â€˜beautiful flowers we used as a symbol for the work I was doing in domestic violence â€¦ it has a concept of justice or strength about it.â€™ These proteas could be interpreted as symbolic of the characteristics of Bryce â€“ her strong character and the experience and wisdom she has demonstrated throughout her career. Like the portraitâ€™s subject, these flowers are not to be trifled with; their appearance conveys consistency, dependability â€“ they command our attention and respect.",

                            "When I was about 16 I was pretty clear about what I wanted to do; it was a pretty bold, enormous ambition to change the world. I saw law as a way to go about it. There certainly were some knockbacks that I had. I mostly kept them to myself because, you know, we were brought up to be pretty stoic in a way, my generation. Little girls were to be seen and not heard, so you sort of took those knockbacks on the chin a bit. But amongst them were people whom I remember with respect and a deep affection, who were great supporters, who encouraged me and anything Iâ€™ve ever achieved in my life has been with wonderful support and encouragement.\\n\\nBut I have to say, Iâ€™m also very conscious of women who donâ€™t have the supports and the opportunities and the encouragement that they need. And very often they are women living on the edges of our society in many ways. My mantra for a long time has been â€˜You can have it all but not all at the same timeâ€™. I think thatâ€™s quite an important thing for women to remember when they are taking on all the responsibilities that they have and the hard road to fulfilling their ambitions, their hopes and their dreams.\\n\\nSo, I am very keen to do anything I can to support and encourage them quietly in the background. Thatâ€™s what I like to focus on now, is this passing on to younger women the sort of help and guidance and encouragement particularly that was given to me by older women.",

                            "This is a landscape portrait 112cm high by 152cm wide. In the immediate foreground against a stark, white background there are three elements to the composition; the surface of a wooden table, a glass vase with flowers and a life size figure of Quentin Bryce cropped to below her hip. The simple, almost forensic, style of the work gives a crisp, light focus to a portrait of a dignified, older woman.\\n\\nQuentin Bryceâ€™s slim figure stands in front of a long, narrow, antique table. Its polished brown surface stretches almost the full width of the portrait. Its legs are spiral-turned. A tall crystal cut glass vase supports three king proteas, each with foliage. The longest of the woody stems leans up and out to the left towards the edge of the table, another stem leans out in the same direction, its flowerhead turned so the bright pink tips of the outer petals circle the central pale pink dome of the flower. A third, shorter protea faces upwards, its small, closed head a soft pale pink. \\n\\nWater in the vase distorts the shapes of the proteasâ€™ stiff brown stems. To the left of the vase, a fallen leaf creates a shadow as it touches the tableâ€™s surface, like the arch of a spoon. \\n\\nQuentin Bryce stands with the vase behind her right elbow. She is turned slightly to the left, looking back at us with a penetrating gaze. Her immaculate, thick, ash blonde hair is parted just off -centre and falls around her ears, cut so it tapers at her nape. \\n\\nQuentin has a high forehead and regular features; her clear, sun-kissed complexion is highlighted by light foundation. Her skin shows signs of age, particularly the furrowed lines between her thin eyebrows; around her eyes, cheeks, chin and neck. She wears large, round, gold and pearl earrings that draw attention to her eyes and lips. Her sparkling blue eyes and bright red lipstick emphasis the directness of her smile. \\n\\nQuentin is dressed in a long-sleeved, two-piece, butter-coloured linen suit with a generous, dove shaped collar. The wide collar is secured at her nape by one of three large cloth- covered buttons. She wears a small gold bar brooch below her left lapel. Her arms are folded, her left hand cradled in the crook of her right arm and her left hand gently holds her right elbow. \\n\\nShe has freckles and veins close to the surface of the thin skin on the backs of her hands. Both hands have silver rings and on her right wrist she wears a polished silver bangle. \\n\\nThe linen jacket finishes at her hips, her matching tailored skirt has light creases indicative of sitting.\\n\\n  \\n**Audio description written by Annette Twyman and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

                            "- When I was about 16, I was pretty clear about what I wanted to do, it was a pretty bold, enormous ambition; 'to change the world'. The altruism that one has at that age, I see it in young ones that I talk to now. I'd always had in the back of my mind doing law, but you know, when I was talking about it at 16 in my last year at school, people said to me, women don't do that, you can't do that. Anyway, in my third year, I changed into arts law. So I am often asked the question about what motivated me to make the choices that I did. It was very much about the times and the opportunities, the advantages of having parents who were committed to our having careers, having independence as well as a family life. I am very conscious of the debt of gratitude I owe to my parents, really for their focus on our education. How lucky we were as a family of girls in the 40's to have a mother and father whose top priority was giving us the best education they possibly could. And I had some role models. I remember I used to have this photograph of one of the first women judges in England, Rose Heilbron. It was all sort of cut out and stuck up, sticky taped in my school Bible. I remember the first girl I knew to go to University and to do science, that was a big thing. Most women were in a very narrow range of occupations and you became conscious of that, leaving school looking at what girls were going to do.\\n\\nThe beautiful flowers were used as a symbol for the work I was doing in domestic violence. We used the protea in different ways and it has a concept of justice and strength about it. It's a great privilege to be painted by a portrait painter like Michael Zavros. A bit scary too. He's a person who I've known for a long time. I went to some of his very earliest exhibitions. We didn't talk about the portrait a lot. I really thought I should just leave that to him. We talked a lot while he was doing sketches. But not so much about how he was going to do it or what it might look like but became obvious as I was sitting and standing but not the emphasis or the interpretation that it would present. This is a \"pinch me\" moment for me talking about these things that are so close to my heart but in the context of a portrait, my portrait, hanging in the National Portrait Gallery. The magic of portraiture or portrait painting that some how fascinates us all.\\n\\nAnything I've ever achieved in my life has been with wonderful support and encouragement. I'm always conscious of the enormous debt that I owe to women who worked in solidarity to open up opportunities for me, for my generation in education in particular. Women indeed do have an enormous role in the economic life of their country and all women need independence. That's why the Women's Movement has been so powerful and so important, women supporting each other. Men have to be in that too, this is about family life. That is at the heart, the very heart, of our society. I feel very deeply about equality and opportunity in a true sense.",

taped in my school Bible.\\n\\n32\\n00:01:51.354 --> 00:01:52.872\\n(laughs)\\n\\n33\\n00:01:52.872 --> 00:01:57.039\\nI remember the first girl I knew to go to University\\n\\n34\\n00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:01.131\\nand to do science, that was a big thing.\\n\\n35\\n00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:05.653\\nMost women were in a very narrow range of occupations\\n\\n36\\n00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:09.460\\nand you became conscious of that, leaving school\\n\\n37\\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.710\\nlooking at what girls were going to do.\\n\\n38\\n00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.300\\nThe beautiful flowers were used as a symbol\\n\\n39\\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300\\nfor the work I was doing\\n\\n40\\n00:02:22.983 --> 00:02:25.335\\nin domestic violence.\\n\\n41\\n00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:28.668\\nWe used the

him.\\n\\n51\\n00:02:57.724 --> 00:03:01.062\\nWe talked a lot while he was doing sketches.\\n\\n52\\n00:03:01.062 --> 00:03:05.663\\nBut not so much about how he was going to do it or\\n\\n53\\n00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:09.468\\nwhat it might look like but became obvious as I was\\n\\n54\\n00:03:09.468 --> 00:03:13.137\\nsitting and standing but not the emphasis

To commemorate her coronation a pink rose named â€˜Queen Elizabethâ€™ was bred by the American rose grower Dr Walter Lammerts, which has since been used to cultivate 30 additional varieties. Fifty years later, on the occasion of Her Majestyâ€™s 2002 Golden Jubilee, flowers once again became an important symbol for the monarch, seen here in the bold backdrop featured in Melbourne-born Polly Borlandâ€™s iconic photographic portrait. This time, the flowers were poppies, immortalised in Finnish brand Marimekkoâ€™s iconic Unikko wallpaper design, created by Maija Isola in 1964. One of the few photographers commissioned to take a portrait for the Jubilee, Borland was allowed five minutes for the shoot, which started as soon as the Queen was in front of the camera. â€˜All of a sudden, I see this woman, whoâ€™s a lot more petite than Iâ€™d imagined, a lot more beautiful than Iâ€™d imagined, a lot richer than Iâ€™d imagined,â€™ Borland says. â€˜I couldnâ€™t talk, I couldnâ€™t remember anything.â€™",

I couldn't talk, I couldn't remember anything, you know I went into this kind of other zone, and completely overwhelmed that all of a sudden the Queen is there who is differentiated by blood. You know, more than just fame, but this woman has a bloodline that is different. And even though I'm not a royalist I was like â€˜Oh my godâ€™. Finally when I found my voice I just started babbling on but she was in a hurry. She was late. She had to go and host a lunch and I'd been told she doesn't really like being photographed. So she just wanted to get it over and done with. And sheâ€™s in front of the camera and Iâ€™m still talking. And then all of a sudden, the minder calls, â€˜two minutesâ€™. And I hadn't taken one roll of film. So he completely stitched me up. And then I just went into total panic. Took one roll. And at one point, I needed her to step to the left and I couldn't think of left. So I was down on my knee, hands and knees, trying to grab her ankles. Luckily, my husband stepped in and said, â€˜No, ma'am, Polly means step to the leftâ€™, grabbed me and got me back behind the camera. I mean, the whole thing was just a total kind of joke. And then she sees the floral background and she goes, â€˜Oh, I like thatâ€™. And also the ring flash was super bright. So by the time she left, she said, â€˜Oh, I think you've blinded meâ€™. And it's a miracle that I got two good photos, a miracle. And that really was the end of my portrait career. Interestingly, even though it was sort of like, probably the pinnacle â€“ I was commissioned by the palace, she's probably one of the most famous women in the world â€“ it kind of was almost like, well, I've done that. And I don't really need to keep doing it.",

                            "This portrait _Her Majesty, The Queen, Elizabeth II (Blue)_ is a photograph created by Polly Borland in 2001. The image is a type C photograph on paper and measures approximately 60 cm high by 50 cm wide. It is surrounded by a wide white mount and narrow light wood frame and is glazed. Queen Elizabeth is at the centre of the image. She wears a bright-blue suit and stands against a flat backdrop with a striking pattern of large flowers.\\n\\nThe background is a Marimekko print of simplified flowers in blues and purples on a white ground. Each flower has rounded petals, a pale centre and a smaller black oval at its heart.\\n\\nQueen Elizabeth stands front on looking at us. Her hair gleams silver and is combed neatly straight up, curving either side of her forehead in soft curls to just behind her ears. She wears round white pearl earrings.\\n\\nQueen Elizabethâ€™s skin is creamy smooth, marked by fine lines across her forehead and around her eyes. Her eyebrows are full, light, and travel down, defining the outer edges of her eyes. A dusting of pale shimmering eyeshadow brightens her eyelids.\\n\\nQueen Elizabethâ€™s eyes are sapphire blue. Her nose is straight, two creases run from her nostrils beneath full cheeks to the outer corners of her mouth. Her lips are painted a bright coral pink and are slightly parted, showing the top row of her teeth.\\n\\nThree strands of matching pearls adorn her neck, resting against the silky blue fabric of her top. A star-shaped brooch, covered in brilliant white diamonds, is pinned to the left shoulder of her suit jacket. Her jacket has notched lapels and is single breasted, fastened together by 3 large round dark-blue pearlescent buttons. It has long sleeves and reaches to hip level. The colour is the same intense electric-blue with a soft sheen as her clothing beneath. However an intricate checkerboard pattern is woven into the fabric.\\n\\nQueen Elizabethâ€™s arms are pulled close to her sides. Over her left forearm hangs the black patent leather strap of her handbag and on her wrist is a watch with a gold link band and slim round face. Queen Elizabeth holds her hands in front, the right clasping the left. The skin on her hands is warmer in tone than that of her face and neck. The backs of her hands are marked by age and her unvarnished nails are cut short.\\n\\nThe portrait is cropped at the lower edge just beneath Queen Elizabethâ€™s hands with only a narrow ribbon of her skirt and handbag included. \\n\\nLucinda Shawcross September 2022",

                                "- Everyone wants to know the story about the Queen. So the story about the Queen is, I'd been told that I was only going to get five minutes, because they were giving all these younger, untried photographers a shot at taking photos of the Queen. The remit was, we only got five minutes. And I had said, right from the beginning, could I bring in my own backdrops? And they'd said yes. So I took in the gold sparkly background, which I'd seen the fabric in an Anne Summers shop window. And then a friend of mine, Martin Grant, the fashion designer, had suggested the famous Marimekko fabric. We go in, we've got a truck, we've got all this equipment. And we set up two cameras, two backdrops, one in front of the other. The minder came in and I was given this protocol. I could curtsy see when she walked in, but I didn't have to. I could bow when she walked in, but I didn't have to. And I should call her ma'am. Spam, ham was how I was to remember ma'am, because I said, \"No, surely it's 'marm'.\" \"No, it's ma'am.\" So I went, okay. And then they said, \"And you need to talk her through what you're going to do.\" I went, okay. And I said to him, \"When are you going to start counting the five minutes?\" \"When she gets in front of the camera.\" I go, okay. So she walks in. All of a sudden I see this woman, who's a lot more petite than I'd imagined, a lot more beautiful than I'd imagined, a lot richer than I'd imagined, a lot, looking very glamorous. And all of a sudden I completely, I couldn't talk, I couldn't remember anything. I went into auto, but the problem was, I'd been given so many options of what that autopilot might look like. And I hadn't picked, thought any of them through, or which one I was.. so I was lost in this sea of choices and quick thinking that, but I couldn't think. And completely overwhelmed that all of a sudden, there's this, the Queenie's there. I went and shook her hand. I then stepped back. And rather than curtsying, I did what I call the Australian squat, which was, I just bent my knees. So I looked like a total idiot at this point. I introduced everyone, I got that bit right. And then I went into this, finally when I found my voice, I'm just babbling on. But she was in a hurry, she had been, she was late. She had to go and host a lunch. She just wanted to get that. And I'd been told she doesn't really like being photographed. So she just wanted to get it over and done with. Well, I talked, and I talked, and I talked, and she's moving closer to the point of where she needs to be. And she's in front of the camera, and I'm still talking. And then all of a sudden, the minder calls, \"Two minutes!\" And I hadn't taken one roll of film. So he completely stitched me up. Rather than saying, I'm going to start counting now, because he'd said to me, but I hadn't taken any pictures. Because he'd also told me that I had to tell her what I was going to do. So I had three minutes. And then I just went into total panic. Took one roll. The camera was even off kilter, like it was a mess. And at one point I needed to step to the left, and I couldn't think of left. So I was down on my hands and knees trying to grab her ankles. Luckily my husband stepped in and said, \"No, ma'am,Â Polly means stepÂ to the left\", grabbed me, and got me back behind the camera. The whole thing was just a total joke. One roll, and I thought , I better go to the other, he called four minutes or something and I'm like, oh my God. So then we do the next set up, and then she sees the floral background. She's fine with the sparkly gold, because it was golden jubilee. And she goes, ooh, like that. And also the ring flash was super bright, so by the time she left, she said, \"Oh, I think you've blinded me.\" And she walked out the door. Apparently Prince Phillip had been in there the whole time. I didn't even see him. That's how disassociated from the experience I was. And it's a miracle that I got two good photos, miracle. And that really was the end of my portrait career. Interestingly, even though it was probably the pinnacle, it was almost like, well, I've done that, and I don't really need to keep doing that. So yeah, that's the story of the Queen. And luckily, I got two pictures out of it. So that's good, yeah.",

about the Queen is,\\n\\n3\\n00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.570\\nI'd been told that I was only going to get five minutes,\\n\\n4\\n00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.081\\nbecause they were giving all these younger,\\n\\n5\\n00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:18.081\\nuntried photographers a shot at taking photos of the Queen.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:20.600\\nThe remit was, we only got five minutes.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.150\\nAnd I had said, right from the beginning,\\n\\n8\\n00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.800\\ncould I bring in my own backdrops?\\n\\n9\\n00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.960\\nAnd they'd said yes.\\n\\n10\\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.090\\nSo I took in the gold sparkly background,\\n\\n11\\n00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.760\\nwhich I'd seen the fabric in an Anne Summers shop window.\\n\\n12\\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.010\\nAnd then a friend of mine, Martin Grant,\\n\\n13\\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.830\\nthe fashion designer, had suggested\\n\\n14\\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.760\\nthe famous Marimekko fabric.\\n\\n15\\n00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.550\\nWe go in, we've got a truck, we've got all this equipment.\\n\\n16\\n00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.350\\nAnd we set up two cameras, two backdrops,\\n\\n17\\n00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.007\\none in front of the other.\\n\\n18\\n00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:53.870\\nThe minder came in and I was given this protocol.\\n\\n19\\n00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.010\\nI could curtsy see when she walked in,\\n\\n20\\n00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.800\\nbut I didn't have to.\\n\\n21\\n00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.490\\nI could bow when she walked in, but I didn't have to.\\n\\n22\\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.090\\nAnd I should call her ma'am.\\n\\n23\\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.530\\nSpam ham was how I was to remember ma'am,\\n\\n24\\n00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.167\\nbecause I said, \"No, surely it's 'marm'.\"\\n\\n25\\n00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:12.090\\n\"No, it's ma'am.\"\\n\\n26\\n00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.170\\nSo I went, okay.\\n\\n27\\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.260\\nAnd then they said, \"And you need to talk her through\\n\\n28\\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.217\\nwhat you're going to do.\"\\n\\n29\\n00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:20.320\\nI went, okay.\\n\\n30\\n00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.310\\nAnd I said to him, \"When are you going to start\\n\\n31\\n00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.947\\ncounting the five minutes?\"\\n\\n32\\n00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:26.067\\n\"When she gets in front of the camera.\"\\n\\n33\\n00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.230\\nI go, okay.\\n\\n34\\n00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.740\\nSo she walks in.\\n\\n35\\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.510\\nAll of a sudden I see this woman,\\n\\n36\\n00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.020\\nwho's a lot more petite than I'd imagined,\\n\\n37\\n00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.220\\na lot more beautiful than I'd imagined,\\n\\n38\\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.840\\na lot richer than I'd imagined,\\n\\n39\\n00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.320\\na lot looking very glamorous.\\n\\n40\\n00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.600\\nAnd all of a sudden\\n\\n41\\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.553\\nI completely,\\n\\n42\\n00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.070\\nI couldn't talk, I couldn't remember anything.\\n\\n43\\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.410\\nI went into auto, but the problem was,\\n\\n44\\n00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.320\\nI'd been given so many options\\n\\n45\\n00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.750\\nof what that autopilot might look like.\\n\\n46\\n00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.060\\nAnd I hadn't picked, thought any of them through,\\n\\n47\\n00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.580\\nor which one I was.\\n\\n48\\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.410\\nSo I was lost in this sea of choices\\n\\n49\\n00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.350\\nand quick thinking that, but I couldn't think.\\n\\n50\\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.470\\nAnd completely overwhelmed that all of a sudden,\\n\\n51\\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.830\\nthere's this, the Queenie's there.\\n\\n52\\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.113\\nI went and shook her hand.\\n\\n53\\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.480\\nI then stepped back.\\n\\n54\\n00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.530\\nAnd rather than curtsying, I did what I call\\n\\n55\\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.320\\nthe Australian squat, which was, I just bent my knees.\\n\\n56\\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.060\\nSo I looked like a total idiot at this point.\\n\\n57\\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.130\\nI introduced everyone, I got that bit right.\\n\\n58\\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.120\\nAnd then I went into this,\\n\\n59\\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.120\\nfinally when I found my voice,\\n\\n60\\n00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.200\\nI'm just babbling on.\\n\\n61\\n00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.560\\nBut she was in a hurry, she had been, she was late.\\n\\n62\\n00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.730\\nShe had to go and host a lunch.\\n\\n63\\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.640\\nShe just wanted to get that.\\n\\n64\\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.840\\nAnd I'd been told she doesn't really\\n\\n65\\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.990\\nlike being photographed.\\n\\n66\\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.640\\nSo she just wanted to get it over and done with.\\n\\n67\\n00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.780\\nWell, I talked, and I talked, and I talked,\\n\\n68\\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.760\\nand she's moving closer to the point of\\n\\n69\\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.680\\nwhere she needs to be.\\n\\n70\\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.310\\nAnd she's in front of the camera, and I'm still talking.\\n\\n71\\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.310\\nAnd then all of a sudden, the minder calls, \"Two minutes!\"\\n\\n72\\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.190\\nAnd I hadn't taken one roll of film.\\n\\n73\\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.940\\nSo he completely stitched me up.\\n\\n74\\n00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.630\\nRather than saying, I'm going to start counting now,\\n\\n75\\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.480\\nbecause he'd said to me, but I hadn't taken any pictures.\\n\\n76\\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.540\\nBecause he'd also told me\\n\\n77\\n00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.910\\nthat I had to tell her what I was going to do.\\n\\n78\\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.953\\nSo I had three minutes.\\n\\n79\\n00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.890\\nAnd then I just went into total panic.\\n\\n80\\n00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.920\\nTook one roll.\\n\\n81\\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.920\\nThe camera was even off kilter, like it was a mess.\\n\\n82\\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.030\\nAnd at one point I needed to step to the left,\\n\\n83\\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.240\\nand I couldn't think of left.\\n\\n84\\n00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.660\\nSo I was down on my hands and knees\\n\\n85\\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.750\\ntrying to grab her ankles.\\n\\n86\\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.590\\nLuckily my husband stepped in and said, \"No, ma'am,\\n\\n87\\n00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.970\\nPolly means stepÂ to the left\", grabbed me,\\n\\n88\\n00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.740\\nand got me back behind the camera.\\n\\n89\\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.630\\nThe whole thing was just a total joke.\\n\\n90\\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.477\\nOne roll, and I thought (beep),\\n\\n91\\n00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.720\\nI better go to the other, he called four minutes\\n\\n92\\n00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.800\\nor something and I'm like, oh my God.\\n\\n93\\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.810\\nSo then we do the next set up,\\n\\n94\\n00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.370\\nand then she sees the floral background.\\n\\n95\\n00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.470\\nShe's fine with the sparkly gold,\\n\\n96\\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.960\\nbecause it was golden jubilee.\\n\\n97\\n00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.410\\nAnd she goes, \"ooh!\", like that.\\n\\n98\\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.510\\nAnd also the ring flash was super bright,\\n\\n99\\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.227\\nso by the time she left, she said,\\n\\n100\\n00:04:31.227 --> 00:04:33.640\\n\"Oh, I think you've blinded me.\"\\n\\n101\\n00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.230\\nAnd she walked out the door.\\n\\n102\\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.670\\nApparently Prince Phillip had been in there the whole time.\\n\\n103\\n00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.730\\nI didn't

miracle.\\n\\n106\\n00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.260\\nAnd that really was the end of my portrait career.\\n\\n107\\n00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.260\\nInterestingly, even though it was probably the

--> 00:05:15.569\\nSo that's good, yeah.\\n\\n113\\n00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.152\\n(bright music)\\n\\n",

                            "Nathan Beard often combines personal family archives and memories with broader cultural signifiers of his Thai heritage to explore the complexities of â€˜authenticityâ€™ and the diasporic experience. His suite of _Siamese Smize_ photographs feature manipulated family portraits found in the artistâ€™s motherâ€™s abandoned family home in Thailand. â€˜Smizeâ€™, slang for smiling with the eyes, is here amalgamated with â€˜Siamese Smileâ€™ â€“ a Thai tourism term from the 1980s used to describe the perceived friendliness that prevails as a Thai stereotype within a Western context. Beardâ€™s family members are bedazzled and partially obscured by Swarovski crystals arranged into Thai floral patterns traditionally found on ceramics and silks. Like Beardâ€™s accompanying sculpture _Noi_, these works, with their painstaking labour of application, memorialise the subjects of the portraits, honouring Beardâ€™s relation to them and to his own heritage.",

                            "Perth-born, Melbourne-based artist Nathan Beard draws on his Thai heritage to explore the porousness of culture and memory. Created in tandem, the sculptures _Heirloom,_ _Phuang Malai_ and _Noi_ are expanded forms of portraiture that pay homage to the artistâ€™s late mother, Noi_._ Beardâ€™s silicone sculptures _Heirloom_ and the newly commissioned work _Phuang Malai_ are fragmented limbs cast from the artistâ€™s own body, entangled with his motherâ€™s possessions: a pair of cheap earrings and her wedding band. These impossible configurations recall the intangible bond between parent and child, as well as the surreal, disembodied mannequins used in visual merchandising. Through these discordant yet entwined associations they question the fluidity of value and worth attached to personal objects. Dotted with fake orchids, the national flower of Thailand, _Phuang Malai_ further embeds this oscillation between authenticity, value, memory and identity.\\n\\n_Noi_ emulates the form of the _bai sri_: Thai floral tributes constructed from organic materials including flowers and banana leaves traditionally used to invoke good luck. Composed from Beardâ€™s late motherâ€™s clothes, the laborious and intricately folded and pinned structure of _Noi_ carries a reflective, devotional quality that celebrates Noiâ€™s personal taste and style.",

                            "A well-known figure in Sydney and Southern Highland social circles, Dora Byrne (1895â€“1972) was an active fundraiser, organising balls and dinners for the Childrenâ€™s Hospital, the Crown Street Womenâ€™s Hospital and the Sydney Industrial Blind Institution. Photographs of her fashionable charity balls were regularly published in the society pages, with Byrne often adorned with living blooms. In a 1936 photograph reproduced in the Australian magazine _The Home_, for example, Byrne is pictured in a silk tulle dress with a white camellia in her hair and a spray of white orchids trailing over her shoulder. In this striking portrait by then in-demand portrait painter Richard von Marientreu, commissioned by Byrne herself, she wears a black off-the-shoulder gown with swathes of blush tulle draped over both arms. Her hands delicately caress a pale pink rose symbolising love, appreciation and gratitude.",

                            "Perth-born, Melbourne-based artist Nathan Beard draws on his Thai heritage to explore the porousness of culture and memory. Created in tandem, the sculptures _Heirloom,_ _Phuang Malai_ and _Noi_ are expanded forms of portraiture that pay homage to the artistâ€™s late mother, Noi_._ Beardâ€™s silicone sculptures _Heirloom_ and the newly commissioned work _Phuang Malai_ are fragmented limbs cast from the artistâ€™s own body, entangled with his motherâ€™s possessions: a pair of cheap earrings and her wedding band. These impossible configurations recall the intangible bond between parent and child, as well as the surreal, disembodied mannequins used in visual merchandising. Through these discordant yet entwined associations they question the fluidity of value and worth attached to personal objects. Dotted with fake orchids, the national flower of Thailand, _Phuang Malai_ further embeds this oscillation between authenticity, value, memory and identity.\\n\\n_Noi_ emulates the form of the _bai sri_: Thai floral tributes constructed from organic materials including flowers and banana leaves traditionally used to invoke good luck. Composed from Beardâ€™s late motherâ€™s clothes, the laborious and intricately folded and pinned structure of _Noi_ carries a reflective, devotional quality that celebrates Noiâ€™s personal taste and style.",

                            "_The chase_ is one of several self portraits Charles Blackman painted in Melbourne in the early 1950s. In the portrait he depicts himself holding a flower in each hand, one living and one dead. Art historian and curator Felicity St John Moore described the paintingâ€™s imagery as an â€˜either-or choice between creation and spiritual deathâ€™. Blackman often used flowers to explore themes such as vulnerability, innocence and alienation. Reflecting on his fascination for flowers, he said: â€˜the flowers evoked the people, in a certain kind of gentility, or substance, or reverence, or sensitivity â€¦ almost like â€¦ the flowers gave the person the identity as well as the person gave the flowers the identity.â€™",

                            "When I first sort of, ten years I painted, I painted in a very emotional way, that is, that I worked from 9 oâ€™clock in the morning till 11 oâ€™clock at night painting like crazy. But it was not really a sort of disciplined thing, it wasnâ€™t really a thought-out thing. It was a thing where it was chasing a substance, it was kind of style chasing a substance. Once the substance was realised in some sort of sense, then the operative thing was to make it function properly, make it function fully. Itâ€™s like, sort of, driving a little baby Austin, finally you become a mature enough driver to be able to run an E-type Jag or a very complex piece of machinery. You have the emotional equipment realised, but it is then to make it a public fact, it is then to make it kind of articulate, a real articulate message in plastic terms, that is, it must be, the feeling must be couched properly in paint, the image must be embedded properly in the paint, must be trapped, as Francis Bacon says very well, in the paint.\\n\\nWell, now I work not so haphazardly, get up very early in the morning, go to the studio, clean up all the brushes, tidy up the room, sweep the floor and start working in a very detached sort of way, and work through disinterest to interest, or work, labour, very long hours on making a painting function within itself in a fairly detached sort of way. But this only could have been done by this kind of organic growth of the personality, it couldnâ€™t have been done in the artificial sense, you canâ€™t outside impose thoughts, they have to grow.",

                            "Fred Williams OBEâ€™s unique approach to landscape emerged in the late 1950s, after his return from a period of study and work in London. The 1960s saw an increasing minimalism in his paintings, in which he sought to evoke the scale of the Australian landscape through canvases of a single colour dotted with tiny flecks of paint bisected by abrupt horizons. Williams applied the same stark approach to his portraits, which were often of his friends. He met artist Clifton Pugh AO (1924â€“1990) after his return from England. The friends painted together often, and for a time Williams lived and worked at Pughâ€™s bushland retreat, Dunmoochin. Williams made this portrait following Pughâ€™s first heart attack in 1974, after which he convalesced in the Williamsâ€™ house in Hawthorn. In his monograph on Williams, Patrick McCaughey writes that the artist has captured â€˜a touching combination of premature age and residual strengthâ€™ in his friend. The work is characteristically enlivened with touches of vibrant colour on the flowers in the foreground and Pughâ€™s hair.",

                            "There was a wild herd of kangaroos in the bush around us, and of course I was very intrigued. I used to creep up and sit down and watch them playing around me. But always very upset because whenever they were aware of me, theyâ€™d gallop off, and I used to feel, if I could let them know that Iâ€™m not going to harm them. But perhaps because of other human beings they were scared. And my feeling the whole time was, if I could only get the birds and animals to realise that Iâ€™m not going to harm them.\\n\\nI saw one kangaroo had been shot and I was really upset about this and I used to go back and look at this â€“ remains. Then I got a shock the following spring, that the animal had practically disintegrated, but out of that area where this animal had died, there were these most beautiful orchids. And that gave me the realisation of this continuing cycle, is that this kangaroo had to die to produce something in the soil that produced these orchids, because they werenâ€™t anywhere else, they were just in this one spot. So all the paintings from then on, right up â€˜til halfway through â€™64, were of birds and animals, and this continuing cycle, always the paintings took the form, organic form of a movement, you could almost call it like a circle, â€˜til this trip came up to the north-west, up to the Kimberleys. There I had a very, very big change of feeling. As I said before, I felt myself not belonging to the world â€“ we were some mistake. Going up there, I felt myself starting to belong for the very first time, and itâ€™s made a big change to the paintings, because now Iâ€™m painting human beings, theyâ€™re in all the paintings Iâ€™m doing, because for the first time perhaps, at the age of 40, Iâ€™m feeling myself starting to belong in the world, that is, the world in its total stage, not just human beings and animals but all being one.",

                            "By the end of the 1970s, Charles Blackman OBEâ€™s status as a premier Australian artist was cemented. Perhaps best known for his signature series of paintings incorporating schoolgirls with flowers and _Alice in Wonderland_ figures and motifs, he exhibited prolifically throughout his career. Blackmanâ€™s _The family_ is an intimate portrait that depicts close family friends, poet and author Judith Wright, her husband journalist and playwright Jack McKinney, and their daughter Meredith. The work fondly recalls a day when Blackman, his wife, the author Barbara Blackman, and the Wright/McKinney family picnicked at Cedar Creek near the flower farms of Mount Tamborine in Queensland in the winter of 1955. Central to the composition are flowers that partially obscure Wrightâ€™s face and are repeated in Meredithâ€™s hat. Flowers were a recurring motif for Blackman, particularly white daisies, which often appear as a symbol of transience in his works.",

                            "The Family was painted by Charles Blackman around 1955. It is oil on board and measures about one metre high by 1.4 metres wide in its frame. The frame is narrow light wood with a stepped surface. This dark shadowy portrait shows the heads and shoulders of, in a row from the left: Jack McKinney, Judith Wright, and their daughter Meredith McKinney. They are painted in a distinctive stylised manner. \\n\\nThe background is divided horizontally; the top fifth is painted pale cream and the lower part, behind the figures, is a mixture of dark browns and greys. The focus is on the figuresâ€™ faces and hats.\\n\\nJack, on the left, wears a hat with a square box-like crown in washed-out blue above a round reddish brim. His face is blue and almost rectangular. His eyes are on a slant. The eye on our left is lower and larger than the other. Below a dark brow, it is an elongated green almond with a large black iris. The eye on the right is higher on the face, set beneath the hat brim; blue with a black iris and a flash of orange highlighting the eyelid. The straight edges of Jackâ€™s nose run parallel to his cheek. His ear on the far left of the portrait is a loop of apricot and blue with a dark centre. Just below the ear, a hand rests on Jackâ€™s shoulder. The lower part of his face and neck is obscured by deep shadow, only interrupted by a sprig of blue-green foliage. \\n\\nThe central figure, Judith, appears shorter than Jack. Her hat with its much flatter rounded crown and narrow brim does not stand as tall as his. The hat is blue and white striped with dashes of red, orange, and green. Judithâ€™s eyes sit in shade under its brim. They are wide-spaced, blue, with pointed inner corners. Their black irises are positioned towards their rounded outer ends. Just beneath Judithâ€™s eyes, a bunch of flowers of different shapes, sizes, and bright colours, hides the half of her face to our left. On the right her face is painted with smudges of white and pink. A pale haze on either side of her face suggests hair. \\n\\nBetween Judith and Meredith, on our far right, is another brightly coloured bouquet. This seems to be held by one of the figures' hands at the very bottom edge of the portrait.\\n\\nMeredith, on the far right, is smaller and shorter than her parents. Her hat has a square crown with a dome fitted within it sitting on a narrow brim. The hat is patterned with blue, white, yellow, and orange flowers. Beneath the hat is a dark band of shadow concealing Meredithâ€™s eyes. Her face, with grey and white skin, tapers with straight lines to a square chin. Her nose is triangular with a narrow bridge widening out to large, rounded nostrils. Meredithâ€™s lips are small and closed, crimson, outlined with black. On either side of her face is an irregular elongated blue-grey shape, possibly representing hair. In front of her chest is a mass of yellow and blue swirls. Meredith wears a white pointed collar and a floral-patterned top with yellow highlighting her shoulder on the far right of the portrait.",

                            "**Meredith McKinney:**Â Charles Blackman was staying with us in the mid 50â€™s, and as far as I can gauge the portrait called The Family would have come out of that particular time.Â My parents met in Brisbane just after the war, and in the beginning it was a very clandestine relationship because he was still married.Â But it was such a powerful relationship that in the end she simply decided to cut her losses and move in with him, and have a child, and take the consequences socially.Â And in those days they were pretty strong consequences.\\n\\nMy sense of childhood, which of course is hindsight, and everybody paints their childhood with hindsight, but my sense of it is just of a kind of a circle, a perfect circle.\\n\\nReally, for Charles my father was probably â€¦ well, to say â€œfather figureâ€ is a very simplistic thing, but the talks that he and my father had were things that sort of drew Charles into new and exciting directions.Â The memories, I suppose, of that time are particularly intense of his working as an artist.Â I was very intrigued by his being an artist at that stage, because I hadnâ€™t even gone to school, and the thing I most wanted to do was draw, as one does before one can write.\\n\\nSo I remember the portrait that he did of me very well, taking me into a room and setting me up at one end of the room and saying, â€œWeâ€™re both going to sit and draw for the day.â€Â And so I drew at one end, and he drew at the other end, and after a while I went over to see what he was drawing, and was astonished and appalled to discover that it was me.",

                            "Margaret Olley ACâ€™s (1923â€“2011) intimate, brilliantly coloured interiors and still lifes always feature flowers. These portraits of Olley by Adam Knott and Lewis Morley were taken in her infamous Paddington home and studio, bursting with the flowers, fruit, artworks and artefacts in which she found endless inspiration. She was known to never throw anything out, and wilted and dried-out floral arrangements can be seen alongside fresh-cut flowers in the photographs. As Olley once said, â€˜If the house looks dirty, buy another bunch of flowers is my adviceâ€™. Her legacy is not only as a painter but as an arts patron and benefactor: since its foundation in 1990, the Margaret Olley Art Trust has donated many Australian and international artworks to public collections nationwide. Tweed River Art Gallery is home to the Margaret Olley Art Centre, which includes a recreation of Olleyâ€™s studio and living space. In Knottâ€™s portrait, Olley is photographed with her aunt, Mrs Knight.",

                            "Margaret Olley AC (1923â€“2011), painter, was born in Lismore and studied art at East Sydney Technical College and the Grande ChaumiÃ¨re in Paris. She was well-known on the Sydney post-war art scene and her portrait was painted by both Russell Drysdale and William Dobell. Dobellâ€™s portrait of Olley, dressed in a gown fashioned from surplus wartime parachute silk, won the 1948 Archibald Prize. Olley held her first one-person show that year. It was a sell-out, and from that beginning, she held at least one solo exhibition annually. The Art Gallery of New South Wales honoured her long career with a major retrospective show in 1996â€“1997. In 1990, she endowed the Margaret Hannah Olley Art Trust, which has funded acquisitions by many Australian institutions including the National Portrait Gallery. One of Sydneyâ€™s most recognisable arts identities, in 2011 she was again the subject of an Archibald Prize-winning portrait, this time by Ben Quilty. In March 2014, almost three years after Olleyâ€™s death at age 88, the Tweed Regional Gallery opened its Margaret Olley Centre, which includes re-creations of rooms from the late artistâ€™s legendary Sydney home.",

Between 1990 and 1996 she completed _The Goddess Series_, portraits of Australian women as mythological/archetypal figures, referring to them as â€˜a testimony to the goodness and healing powers of womenâ€™. In this series, Valadon often used plants and flowers as iconography to portray her sitters, which can be seen in her portrait of sculptor Frances Joseph as Gaia, the Greek goddess of the earth. The 1991 Portia Geach prize-winning work hangs behind Valadon in her portrait by Greg Weight.",

During the war, Smith worked in a camouflage unit with fellow artist William Dobell. In January 1944 Dobell's portrait of Smith was awarded the Archibald Prize for 1943. A law case ensued, with the artist complainants alleging that Dobell's work was a caricature of his friend. The court found that it was a good likeness. The trial was inevitably distracting, embarrassing and debilitating for Dobell and Smith, but the following year Smith rallied to win the Archibald himself, for a portrait of HS Rosevear. Dobell's portrait of Smith was badly damaged in a fire in 1958, but it has since been restored. Smith painted several memorable portraits, including one of Dame Mary Gilmore and a haunting study of his parents acquired by the Art Gallery of NSW in 1943. He was a regular exhibitor in the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes for many years.",

                            "The procedure for the portrait: Mr Rosevear came to the home and I painted it in our breakfast room where mother would prepare tea in between sittings. If I remember correctly, I asked for about 15 sittings. Being the first official portrait that Iâ€™d been given from the Government I was rather a bit scared, you know. Anyway, Mr Rosevear was very co-operative, and it eventually won the Archibald, so, quite good!\\n\\nNow with my own procedure as regards portrait painting, that has varied considerably over the years. At one stage, I used to make a small drawing, say about 15 inches deep, in pencil, and more in the nature of a very accurate map, and then work from that; but later I found that I prefer to draw straight onto the canvas with charcoal, just dust that off and then paint direct. And I also like to have my sitter in front of me the whole time.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™ve been asked to say something about Chips Raffertyâ€™s portrait and how I did it. Well that was painted out in the open in the lawn in his backyard. I had a good many sittings. I remember Chips saying to me, â€˜Youâ€™ve worn a track across my lawn, running backwards and forwards!â€™. I like to have my canvas right alongside my subject and get back from it to make my observations as far as possible.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™ve been asked about any particular highlights in my life. Well, I think one of the most important things that I can remember is my first sale of a drawing. And it was a little drawing of my mother, a pencil drawing of my mother playing the piano. And we had it in the Julian Ashton School sketch club. And I was sitting next to the late Julian Ashton and Julian turned to me and said, â€˜Would you take half a guinea for it?â€™. I said â€˜Sold!â€™.",

                            "This portrait of Australian surgeon and educator Henry â€˜Harryâ€™ Crock AO (1929â€“2018) was painted by British artist David Smith, in the artistâ€™s home in London. With a career spanning five decades, Crock was recognised as one of the worldâ€™s leading orthopaedic surgeons. At the time the portrait was created, Crock was working as Honorary Senior Lecturer and Consultant Spinal Surgeon at Hammersmith Hospital. Reflecting the close friendship between artist and subject, Smithâ€™s portrait focuses on Crockâ€™s personality, creating a strong sense of a contemplative, learned and caring man whose career has been dedicated to healing. The work also alludes to Crockâ€™s longstanding love of the visual arts â€“ one of the artworks depicted in the background is a woodcut by Tate Adams in Smithâ€™s own collection. A single yellow tulip adds a soft touch to the otherwise strong verticals of the composition, echoing the subject of the portrait.",

                            "Margaret Prestonâ€™s (1875â€“1963) woodblock prints and paintings are distinctly Australian, and often include wildflowers, harbour scenes and images of Sydneyâ€™s growth as a modern metropolis. Preston drew inspiration from the bushland around her harbourside home in Mosman, and became a vigorous campaigner for her vision of a modern Australian art that recognised the unique beauty of native trees and flowers. As Preston noted, â€˜Each flower is individual, they never respond to being turned into bouquets, as roses and violets do. These flowers show form and colour in simple treatment.â€™ This portrait of Preston surrounded by olearias (daisy bush) in her Mosman garden was taken by Harold Cazneaux who, in his prolific 40-year career as a photographer, created a rich catalogue of Sydneyâ€™s mood and people, and produced many photographs that have since attained mythic status. Like many of Cazneauxâ€™s works, this one demonstrates his belief that the best portraits were achieved through photographing in the â€˜natural surroundings of your home and gardenâ€™.",

                            "Del Kathryn Barton is one of Australiaâ€™s most celebrated contemporary artists, famous for her figurative paintings that feature fantastical characters posed against ornate backgrounds. Many of Bartonâ€™s intricate paintings are focused on women, often surrounded by an abundance of flowers, fruit and other symbols of femininity and female power. In _Maggie_, Barton combines a statuesque likeness of cook, restaurateur, businesswoman and media personality Maggie Beer AO (b. 1945) with a spellbinding and dream-like personalised symbology of the sitter. In making the work, Barton asked Beer to provide a list of two of her favourite fruit and vegetables from each season. The eight chosen ingredients, including peas, asparagus, peaches, quince, pomegranate and tomatoes, become pictorial elements woven around the central figure. They signify Beerâ€™s passions and personality in the same way that objects were used to identify saints in the history of art. Beer holds her favourite flower â€“ a yellow rose â€“ to her heart, a consciously romantic inclusion by the artist who described her impression that her sitter â€˜fills up a room with light and energy and generosityâ€™. The yellow rose represents friendship, joy and warmth, here adding to the energy radiating from the sitter.",

                            "Robert Rooneyâ€™s series of portraits of 1980s Melbourne arts identities included his gallerist Bruce Pollard (b. 1936), who established the Pinocotheca Gallery in a St Kilda mansion in 1967, and relocated it to an old hat factory in Richmond in 1970. Aside from Legge and Watters in Sydney, it was the only gallery in Australia showing experimental work in the late 1960s and 1970s. Among the more than 300 artists who showed there were Rooney, Peter Booth, Dale Hickey, Rosalie Gascoigne, James Gleeson, Bill Henson, Tony Tuckson and Stelarc. Many of the portraits in Rooneyâ€™s series were taken spur of the moment, such as this photograph of Pollard in a domestic setting, a vase of jasmine softening the wooden table littered with beer cans.",

                            "While there are no plants or flowers apparent within this portrait itself, Professor George Seddon AMâ€™s (1927â€“2007) life was defined by them. Seddon was a polymath â€“ a professor of geology, the history and philosophy of science, and environmental science â€“ who radically rethought our relationship to the environment. He wrote popular books on the Australian landscape embracing diverse points of view, as well as practical guides to gardening. It was through his work as an urban designer that artist Peter Ciemitis first encountered Seddon, whose 1972 essay _Sense of Place_ the artist described as â€˜a must-read text to planners and designers of my generationâ€™. Documenting Seddonâ€™s experience and research into the Swan Coastal Plain in Western Australia (including its flora, soils and climate), _Sense of Place_ has since become a landmark Australian environmental publication. In the portrait, Ciemitis aimed to capture a sense of his subjectâ€™s connection to the landscape: â€˜It is not only a map of George but a reference to a map of place: the environment with which George is concerned.â€™",

                            "Margaret Coen (1909â€“1993) is known for her vibrant still lifes of flowers and serene landscapes. Drawn to painting flowers, she once said: â€˜Flowers have a life of their own. Flowers arenâ€™t static, they move. Nasturtiums will turn right round to look at the light in a room. Movement in flowers is difficult to paint, but thatâ€™s the aim.â€™ Photographer Greg Weight took this portrait in Coenâ€™s light-filled home studio in the Sydney suburb of St Ives, where she lived for almost 40 years. Next to her is a vase of flowers freshly picked from her garden: azaleas, jasmine and native rock orchids.",

                            "Dame Elisabeth Murdoch AC DBE (1909â€“2012) contributed unstintingly to cultural, educational, medical, environmental and community causes throughout her life. Born in Melbourne, she married newspaper proprietor Keith Murdoch in 1928 and moved to Cruden Farm near Langwarrin, where they raised their four children. In 1933 she joined the management committee of the Royal Children's Hospital, of which she was president from 1954 to 1965 and enabled the establishment of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in 1986. She supported the work of the Walter & Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, the Royal Institute for Deaf & Blind Children, the Burnet Institute and the Bionic Ear Institute. The first woman to serve on the council of the National Gallery of Victoria, she endowed the Dame Elisabeth Murdoch Sculpture Foundation, the Dame Elisabeth Murdoch Arboretum and the Australian Ballet, and supported a range of programs to assist prisoners, children in care and other marginalised groups.\\n\\nDame Elisabeth was integral to the founding of the Victorian Tapestry Workshop â€“ now the Australian Tapestry Workshop â€“ in 1976, making them the obvious choice to create her portrait for the Gallery's collection. Former ATW Director Sue Walker recalls that Murdoch took great interest in the creation of her portrait, 'exhibiting her famous, exuberant excitement at the completion of the weaving'.",

                            "This is a delicate mixed media portrait of philanthropist and founding patron of the Victorian Tapestry Workshop, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, created in 2000 by the now-named Australian Tapestry Workshop. It measures approximately 145 centimetres by 125 centimetres. The image was composed by painter Christopher Pyett, adapted on computer by printmaker Normana Wight and woven on the loom by Merrill Dumbrell.\\n\\nIt is displayed hanging between a white backing board and clear Perspex cover.\\n\\nElisabeth is shown from the chest up, her body angled slightly to the right and facing front on. Behind her, the lush greenery of her garden at Cruden Farm, Langwarrin. Wool and cotton woven threads create a textured surface. Different colour threads in the weft are bundled together to produce a flecked effect, enhancing the texture and blending a palette of creams, pinks and greens together across the surface of the work.\\n\\nGarden foliage fills the background in a simplified and abstracted design. At the top, deep olive-green tones give a sense of depth, transitioning downwards to a range of bright and dark greens and yellows marking abstracted leaves, branches, and shrubbery, and creams and soft pinks creating blossoms.\\n\\nElisabeth is positioned against this garden backdrop, seen from the chest up, facing forward while leaning back and towards the left.\\n\\nHer warm creamy skin has sparse amounts of purples, pinks, and yellow-green threads interwoven, introducing colours used in the background and clothing. Her white hair is pulled back from her face in a loose fashion, tied at the nape of her neck, tendrils escaping. Her forehead is gently furrowed above white framed glasses. Elisabeth gazes outwards with violet eyes lined with gentle wrinkles and hooded eyelids. Her closed blush pink lips are relaxed and have deep crevices on either side above a soft chin. Her neck emerges from a collared blouse woven in an intricate floral pattern of pinks, purples, charcoal grey, white and cream.\\n\\nHer left hand is pulled up to gently rest upon her upper chest. Elisabethâ€™s fingers are slightly splayed, swollen at the joints, showing signs of age and arthritis, revealing a wedding band and a plain faced silver wristwatch.\\n\\nAudio Description written by Alana Sivell and read by Amy Middleby",

                            "**Sue Walker:** Well, Dame Elisabeth has been a most wonderful friend and supporter to me, and I was the Founding Director of the Victorian Tapestry Workshop, which began in 1976. And Dame Elisabeth Murdoch was of course the driving force behind the establishment of the workshop.\\n\\n**Christopher Pyett:** I first met Dame Elisabeth at the Tapestry Workshop. She enjoys a sense of humour. She enjoys a joke, she enjoys being teased. We get on well like that.\\n\\n**Sue Walker:** Well, when Andrew Sayers approached us with the idea of weaving a portrait of Dame Elisabeth, I thought it was enormously exciting. Chris Pyett seemed a very suitable person to be involved in this project. He spent time with her in the garden.\\n\\n**Christopher Pyett:** We took a series of photographs totalling about 55, 60. The first series were of her wearing blue. A lot of her character is expressed in her clothing, and the blue she always wears for a formal occasion. I got her to change that, because it never really did her â€¦ you know, none of them look comfortable, do they? But when we got her into a patterned dress it fitted much better.\\n\\n**Sue Walker:** Well, Dame Elisabeth is one of those exceptional people who have imagination and vision, huge human warmth, and then the capacity to follow that up, not only financially but also with their own personal encouragement.\\n\\n**Christopher Pyett:** When I look at the portrait, and look at her eyes, I can just hear her saying to herself, â€œWhat on earth do they want a portrait of me for?â€\\n\\n**Sue Walker:** Her warmth, her enthusiasm, her great joy and delight in everything we did, has just been one of the greatest things in my whole professional life.\\n\\n**Christopher Pyett:** Her contribution to the life of Australia has been absolutely immense, so I think there should be a tapestry portrait of her all over Australia!\\n\\nÂ ",

German-born photographer Heide Smith took this portrait of her friend clutching pink and white hellebores (Lenten roses) in the garden at Manning Clark House, in the Canberra suburb of Forrest. An advocate for the environment and a passionate gardener, Dymphna maintained large vegetable gardens in Forrest and worked with Greening Australia volunteers to plant over 1000 native trees at the familyâ€™s property at Wapengo on the NSW south coast.",

                            "Glenn Murcutt AO (b. 1936), architect, received the world's highest architectural honour when he was awarded the Pritzker Prize in April 2002. Having spent a good deal of his youth in New Guinea, where he learned to love simple shapes and materials, Murcutt only just scraped into a university architecture course at the University of New South Wales, graduating in 1961. As a student, he drew on principles he had learned while working for his father, who had a number of building businesses in Sydney after the war. Murcutt is unusual among Pritzker winners in that he works alone, mostly on residential homes; he has never made a skyscraper or a tourist attraction; and he uses mostly basic materials. By using shades, louvres, fully opening walls and carefully planned ventilation he enables his buildings to respond instantly to changing conditions and requirements. His overriding design philosophy is that dwellings should 'touch the earth lightly'. There are several books about his work, including _Leaves of Iron_ (1991) and _Touch This Earth Lightly_ (2000) by Philip Drew and _Glenn Murcutt: Buildings + Projects 1962â€“2003_ (2003) by FranÃ§oise Fromonot. Murcutt's Islamic Centre project, an unconventional mosque in suburban Melbourne, is at the heart of an intimate film about Murcutt by Catherine Hunter, _Glenn Murcutt: Spirit of Place_ (2016). He is a Professor at UNSW, and is the principle 'master' on the Architecture Foundation Australia annual International Architecture Master Classes.",

                            "For me in architecture nature has a beautiful story. You look at the strength of our flora but also look at the delicacy at the same time. So thereâ€™s a strength and a delicacy. I love the idea of the legibility of the strength. I love the delicacy of the edges. And so in my work, I like to articulate that which is structure, that which is skin, that which is edge. These are things that are in nature in this part of the world and I have endeavoured in my career to try and understand this landscape of ours and be able to integrate these elements not in a determined way but in a very relaxed way. So that there is the articulation of elements without it being such that you are forced to look at it. I donâ€™t like an architecture that is saying to me, Look at me, look at me, look at me. I want an architecture thatâ€™s quiet, that reveals itself quietly, and the more you start to see it, the more you start to understand it.\\n\\nThe roots of architecture remain relevant. If you go beyond the roots of architecture, about space, about order, about structure, about understanding nature and structure â€¦ If you go and just do something for the sake of it, for example, youâ€™ll hear students talking about, Oh I wanted to do this and I wanted to do that. Thatâ€™s delinquent. What does the brief call for? What does the site call for? What does the economics call for? What does the structure call for, what are the materials available? These are the things â€“ itâ€™s not what I want. Itâ€™s what these things are asking to be addressed.\\n\\nI am very happy at the age of over 80 now still practising like mad and still enjoying it as I did as a young architect.",

                            "John Farnham AO (b. 1949), singer-songwriter, tasted his first success in 1968 with the throwaway single 'Sadie'. He was voted Australia's King of Pop five years in a row between 1969 and 1973, when he also appeared in a variety of stage shows and musicals. His career stalled for the second half of the 1970s. He formed a band and went back on the performance circuit from 1982, briefly as the lead singer of the Little River Band, before returning to the charts with a version of the Beatles' song 'Help' in the mid-eighties. The solo record he released in 1986, _Whispering Jack_, became Australia's first CD album and the nation's biggest-selling album to date, going platinum 17 times on the domestic market alone. He was Australian of the Year in 1987; his albums _Age of Reason_ (1988) and _Chain Reaction_ (1990) both debuted at number 1. The genial Farnham remains one of Australia's best-loved celebrities, finishing high on the list of the ABC'S My Favourite Australian poll in 2008 and being recognised as \\n\\nAustralian of the Year in 1987.",

Sellick turned up at Dunstanâ€™s Norwood home for the shoot with his artist friend Phillip â€˜Sundayâ€™ Hopkins, for moral support. Dunstan was dressed for the shoot but was encouraged by the pair to instead take a dip in the pool in his backyard. Sellick recalls that over the years numerous people have commented on the flower that looms large at the foreground of the frame, which is known colloquially as a Naked Lady. Despite its suggestive nickname, the Belladonna Lily is in fact a symbol of strength and endurance, and in this instance could perhaps be read as a testament to Dunstanâ€™s long and prosperous career in social reform.",

                            "Anne Boyd AM (b. 1946), composer and teacher, was born in Sydney and studied composition with Peter Sculthorpe at the University of Sydney before earning a PhD at the University of York. She lectured in music at the University of Sussex before returning to Australia to take up an Australia Council grant that enabled her to work full-time as a composer between 1977 and 1981. She had already written one of her best-known works, As I crossed a bridge of dreams, which is part of the standard contemporary choir repertoire, but during this period she wrote various chamber works, the oratorio The Death of Captain Cook, and the choral symphony Coal River. In 1981 she became the founding head of Hong Kong University's Department of Music, and in 1990 Professor and Head of the Department of Music at the University of Sydney. While working in Hong Kong she wrote the children's opera The Little Mermaid for the Australian Opera. Boyd gained wider fame as a public advocate of increased funding for Australian universities as the focus of the Bob Connolly/Robin Anderson documentary Facing the Music in 2001.",

                            "One of my earliest musical experiences is the memory of my aunt playing the piano and singing in the adjacent lounge room to our â€“ well what was still called then the nursery, on this country property. Also, I used to listen to the radio a lot, in fact one of my favourite games was playing with the frequencies of radios and seeing what kinds of statics and sounds I could pick up, and of course, short wave was just fantastic and I was able to often, during the evening, pick up neighbouring Asian stations and so on, and this music really excited me as a child. Whenever I heard music I was always drawn to it. I had to go and listen to it. At about the age of six, my sister sent me a recorder and a teach-yourself manual so, of course, I taught myself to play the recorder in a very short time. This again was something which was very important to me as a means of expression and I, in fact, started writing quite â€“ well, bizarre scores, really the notation of which meant nothing to anybody except myself, but I used to derive a great deal of enjoyment from playing these weird symbols that Iâ€™d managed to put down onto paper.\\n\\nPerhaps my attraction to the sound of shortwave and the static and so on that was created by the radio is a result of my trips by air, the first one of which I undertook as a small child at the age of two. The sounds of the engines of the plane even fascinated me, and the variation in the contrasting timbres and dynamics of what happened when you were actually up in the air. I think probably my fascination with sound of all kinds was a result of living in a silent or a comparatively silent environment in the country, and so therefore these sounds of the city, of machines, of planes, in my rare contacts with them, are all the more meaningful to me.",

                            "Freshness is key to the career of fourth-generation Australian-Chinese chef, restauranteur, author and television presenter Kylie Kwong AM (b. 1969). Renowned for her exciting blend of Cantonese and Australian cuisine, Kwong is an advocate for native, organic and biodynamic ingredients, and uses food as a catalyst for positive social impact and cultural exchange. She learnt the finer points of Cantonese cooking in her mother Paulineâ€™s kitchen. At age 25, after a career in graphic design, Kwong apprenticed with Neil Perry at Rockpool, and within two years was made head chef at Perryâ€™s Wokpool. In 2000 she opened the restaurant Billy Kwong in Surry Hills with her friend, Bill Granger, taking over the restaurant a year later. It was a Sydney staple for 19 years. Kwong has collaborated with photographer Simon Griffiths on several books, including _My China: A feast for all the senses_ (2007) and _It Tastes Better_ (2010). Here she is captured by Griffiths in motion with a basket full of fresh produce and flowers, as if on the way home from the markets.",

Alexanderâ€™s 17 books include her bestselling _The Cookâ€™s Companion_, a staple in many Australian homes. In this portrait by Tsering Hannaford, Alexander is dressed in luxe purple florals. In addition to being Alexanderâ€™s favourite colour, purple evokes the forthrightness of the suffragettes.

He has appeared on television in _MasterChef_, _My Restaurant Rules_ and _Matt Moranâ€™s Paddock to Plate_, and written bestselling cookbooks. His passion for quality, seasonal and locally sourced produce is reflected in this exuberant portrait by Murray Fredericks and Lisa Giles. A play on 16th-century Italian artist Caravaggioâ€™s _Boy with a basket of fruit_, Moran is classically posed and almost dwarfed by the abundance of fruit and blooms he carries.",

                            "Alexis Wright (b. 1950), author and activist, won the Miles Franklin Award in 2007 for her novel Carpentaria and the 2018 Stella Prize for her collective memoir _Tracker_. A woman of the Waanyi nation of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Wright was raised by her mother and grandmother in Cloncurry, her non-Aboriginal cattleman father having died when she was five years old. Her first novel, _Plains of Promise_, was published in 1997 and was shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers Prize, a New South Wales Premierâ€™s Literary Award and the Age Book of the Year. Throughout the ensuing decade Wrightâ€™s short stories and essays were included in a number of anthologies and in journals such as _Overland_, _Australian Humanities Review_ and _Southerly_, and her criticism appeared in _The Age_ and _Meanjin_, among other publications. _Carpentaria,_ a 500-page-long novel about an Aboriginal family from the Gulf, was written in a style incorporating â€˜the way we tell stories and in the voice of our own people and our own way of speakingâ€™, and was initially rejected by several publishers. On its eventual appearance in 2006, however, it won a slew of awards including the Victorian, New South Wales and Queenslandâ€™s Premierâ€™s Literary Awards for Fiction; the Australian Book Industry Award for Book of the Year; and the Australian Literary Societyâ€™s gold medal, in addition to the Miles Franklin. Her third novel The _Swan Book_ (2014) was also awarded the ALS gold medal and was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin and the Victorian and New South Wales Premierâ€™s Awards. In addition, through her work as a researcher, activist and consultant with various Aboriginal organisations, she has published widely on Indigenous issues and land rights in Australia and overseas. Her non-fiction titles as author and editor include _Grog War_ (1997), examining alcohol abuse in the Northern Territory, and _Take Power_ (1998), an anthology of writing on land rights in Central Australia. Wright has undergraduate qualifications in social studies and creative writing and a doctorate from RMIT. She is currently a Distinguished Fellow of the Writing and Society Research Centre at the University of Western Sydney.",

                            "This is a photographic portrait of Aboriginal author and activist â€“ Alexis Wright. Photo by Ingvar Kenne, 2009.\\n\\nThe portrait is approx. one metre square showing a full length, standing view of Alexis in a blackened, burnt-out landscape of predominately bare trees.  \\nThe upper half of the photograph features a pale, greyish-white sky with tall, burnt tree trunks extending up and out to the sky beyond. In the upper left corner, several trees twist and bend across each other.\\n\\nIn the background and halfway down the photo, the hazy curve of a distant hill crosses through the landscape. Numerous blackened and bare trees cover the sloping ground in front.\\n\\nThe figure of Alexis occupies the centre and lower half of the scene. To the left of Alexis and slightly behind, a large black tree trunk stands tall, reaching up and out beyond the portrait. Sprouting from the trunk are several bright green patches of leafy new growth. \\n\\nAlexis stands on a sloped area of ash covered earth, left blackened and charred by fire.  \\nShe looks directly at us, eyes squinting, mouth closed, with a look of sadness or dismay. Her auburn shoulder length hair is slightly curly, and part of her fringe is swept back. A segment hangs raggedly on her forehead.\\n\\nThe left side of her body is angled slightly forward, and she wears a black round- necked top under a black zippered jacket. Her zipper open to mid-torso, the jacket lining and collar is a dark grey,. Both her hands are tucked into her practical jacket pockets. Her pale right hand is partly visible. \\n\\nAlexis wears long black pants and tan coloured moccasins.\\n\\nBurnt branches, twigs and debris are scattered around her. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Pauline McCreath and voiced by Rory Walker**",

Their self portraits increasingly incorporate fake flowers, fashioned into _Aoâ€™ Kakala_ or cloud mask forms, as worn by the artist in _Ao Kakala Mask self portrait_ and _Aoâ€™ Kakala Mask_. Due to the scarcity of tropical flowers in Aotearoa/New Zealand, MonÅ« has pivoted to using vibrant plastic options sourced from local shops, thus honouring cultural traditions while also reflecting the adaptability inherent in diasporic life. The use of plastic beads link them back to the world of _leitÄ«_ â€“ individuals with a feminine gender expression. These vibrant adornments are used by the artist to suggest the performativity inherent in everyday life.",

Their self portraits increasingly incorporate fake flowers, fashioned into _Aoâ€™ Kakala_ or cloud mask forms, as worn by the artist in _Ao Kakala Mask self portrait_ and _Aoâ€™ Kakala Mask_. Due to the scarcity of tropical flowers in Aotearoa/New Zealand, MonÅ« has pivoted to using vibrant plastic options sourced from local shops, thus honouring cultural traditions while also reflecting the adaptability inherent in diasporic life. The use of plastic beads link them back to the world of _leitÄ«_ â€“ individuals with a feminine gender expression. These vibrant adornments are used by the artist to suggest the performativity inherent in everyday life.",

                            "Ingvar Kenneâ€™s portrait of Australian fashion model Anneliese Seubert (b. 1973) evokes an uncanny synthetic quality enhanced by the bright lighting and cheery yellow chrysanthemums clasped in Seubertâ€™s outstretched hand. This effect lends the sitter a mannequin-like pallor and recalls the numerous glossy fashion spreads she has appeared in over the years. Seubert won the Ford Models Supermodel of the World competition in 1990, aged 17. Signing with the Paris-based agency Karin, she lived in Paris and then New York for the next two decades, walking the runway for Dior, Hermes, Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Versace, and appearing in editorials for magazines such as _Vogue_, _Marie Claire_, _Harperâ€™s Bazaar_ and _Elle_. Ingvar Kenne took this photograph during one of Seubertâ€™s regular trips home. In line with Kenneâ€™s deceptively simplistic and intimate style, there was no hairdresser or makeup artist for the shoot. As Seubert recalled: â€˜Iâ€™m like, â€œOh my god.â€ Worst nightmare. But I mean, the photos were beautiful, and it was quite an interesting shoot because it was full sunlight.â€™",

                            "The previous year to the year I was in the Dolly Covergirl Competition, Kate Fischer had actually won it, and she was at the same school, at Girls Grammar. My friend said, \"Well if she can win it, \"you can win it too.\" So we took some photos and sent them in, and then I was a finalist. And my little blurb, I mean it's quite fashionable if you're into STEM, as everyone is these days, but my favourite subject was maths, and I loved skiing. Because I didn't win, I just started working on weekends and in school holidays. And I think I was in year 10 when I was in the competition, so through year 11 and 12 I gradually started working a bit more.\\n\\nMy first jobs were for a magazine called _Follow Me_. And then a couple of _Vogue_ jobs, _Harper's Bazaar_ was around then as well. When I was 17, I had an Australian _Vogue_ cover which was great, and some advertising clients, and off I went. I kind of did a preliminary trip when I was in year 12, I did the _Ford Supermodel Competition_, and I went to L.A. by myself. I won that competition and then went to New York for a couple of weeks, so I'd had a little taste of what it was going to be like, and then I went back to school.\\n\\nSo I finished year 12, and then off to Paris. And I just started going on castings. I thought I had great pictures in my portfolio, but people over in Paris looked at them and like, \"hmm,\" you know, they're kind of a little bit, \"daggy Australian,\" in a way. So I started working, got more pictures and then started doing shows. Then I got very busy traveling and... so many markets around, there's Paris, Germany, Spain, Italy. I was flying from one job to the next. Sometimes you didn't come home in between. But I was kind of just let free. I don't know if I'd do that with my kids now.\\n\\nBack in the '90s, you would either get a telephone call from your agency in the afternoon before and check what you had to do for the next day, or sometimes you got a fax. You would have to go and visit a client and show them your pictures, maybe try on some clothes, talk to them about what you'd been doing. It's more of a collaboration. The client and the photographer, usually an art director as well. They will all say, \"This is what we'd like.\" They often have reference images. They can tell you a story.\\n\\nI used to do John Galliano's fashion shows. And he would always make this huge story, and each character, which was essentially each dress or outfit, had a story and a part in the story. So when you were walking around through the scene, the set, you would be imagining that you were this lady on the rooftop who was running away from something. There was always a little story. But I think there was a difference between putting on a Galliano dress, it just made you feel amazing. So just channeling that and thinking about how fabulous you look is really the way it works, I think. 'Cause if you don't believe it, no one else will.\\n\\nWhen I was 24, I was based in Paris. I used to come home three times a year, so I was home for Christmas, home for August, and there was usually either I'd meet mum and dad somewhere, or I came home for an extra trip. And I often worked in Sydney while I was home, and the portrait that's hanging, it was funny, because I was so used to turning up at a shoot and having hair and makeup, and they would turn me into a different character. This time, they're like, \"Oh no, we just want you.\" Like, what are you talking about? Where's the hairdresser? \"Oh, we just want it to look like you did your own hair.\" Are you serious? And no makeup? \"No, no, look how beautiful you are!\" I'm like, \"Oh my god.\" Worst nightmare. My hair is hard to do for a hairdresser at the best of times, so I was a little bit in shock. But I mean, the photos were beautiful, and it was quite an interesting shoot because it was full sunlight and flash, I think. So the lighting is quite harsh.

                            "Akira Isogawa (b. 1964), fashion designer, was born in Kyoto, Japan, and first came to Australia at the age of 21. After immigrating, he worked as a waiter while studying fashion design at East Sydney TAFE and Sydneyâ€™s National Art School. In 1993 he opened the Akira Isogawa boutique in Woollahra, and swiftly established a reputation for his bold and intelligent clothes. At Sydneyâ€™s Australian Fashion Week in 1996, he sent all his models out wearing red socks from Gowings because he couldnâ€™t afford shoes for them; but he has shown at every Fashion Week since, and since 1998 he has shown twice annually in Paris. He has exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art, and Sydneyâ€™s Object Galleryâ€™s exhibition of his construction techniques is said to have been its most successful ever show. The National Gallery of Victoriaâ€™s _Akira Isogawa: Printemps EtÃ©_ in 2004-2005 was the first solo exhibition of an Australian designerâ€™s work to be shown at one of its major art institutions and later toured to Singapore, Manila and Bangkok. In 2005 Isogawa was depicted on the â€˜Australian Legendsâ€™ series of postage stamps and in 2007 he was named the countryâ€™s first Fashion Laureate. He has designed costumes for four Sydney Dance Company productions and for the Australian Balletâ€™s production of Graeme Murphyâ€™s _Romeo and Juliet_ in 2010. Sydneyâ€™s Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences showed the retrospective _Akira Isogawa_ at 2018-2019. Since the Woollahra boutique closed in 2017, Australiaâ€™s only two Akira boutiques are in the Strand Arcade, Sydney, and Fortitude Valley, Brisbane.",

                            "When I look back, being a teenager growing up in a traditional city in Japan called Kyoto, I felt I was a bit of a fashion victim, really. Well now actually I create fashion. But back then, actually, I was consuming fashion and that's how much I loved [it].  \\nJapanese culture is so different from Western ones. My grandparents had a house next door. They were all wearing actually traditional clothes â€“ kimono. What I noticed about kimono is actually they're made out rectangular shaped cloth. And they have no shapes. Whereas actually, Western clothes has a particular shape that enhance, particularly actually for female, the femininity of female body, but whereas actually kimono is totally unisex. I mean, I've never actually designed kimono myself. But being a kimono designer, I imagine actually, they work on texture, colour, print, and so on, because it's a highly textile driven fashion, and then to me, that's what Japanese fashion is all about. You know, when I design my own collection, I never really force myself to express my Japanese entity, but I feel that it just comes up naturally. And I think what's interesting is that not just, you know, designing something so traditionally Japanese, but then I kind of actually manage to fuse with Australian ease I guess actually. Australia has got this particular attitude â€“ friendly to start with â€“ but it's quite actually casual about things, you know. I feel actually my design is a result of actually, you know, some Japanese heritage with Australian attitude, which is actually friendly and easy.",

                            "In the late 1970s and early 1980s Robert Rooney took a series of 75 photographic portraits of the Melbourne art scene, often set in suburban houses or streetscapes. Rooneyâ€™s subjects included surrealist painter Peter Booth (b. 1940), who gained widespread recognition through the inclusion of his large architectural â€˜blockâ€™ paintings in the National Gallery of Victoriaâ€™s exhibition _The Field_ in 1968. Rooney captured Booth outside his studio with a cigarette; the bouquet of roses next to him innocuous against the concrete and corrugated iron of the inner-city landscape. Of the series Rooney wrote: â€˜These portraits were to be as perfect as I could make them. There were certain rules â€“ to use available light, no matter how dim (long exposures and a hand-held camera), and no cropping.â€™",

                            "Eight-time Archibald Prize winner Sir William Dargie CBE painted at least two portraits of Melbourne-born philanthropist Dame Merlyn Myer DBE (1900â€“1982). This portrait depicts the matriarch at ease on a floral-patterned sofa, wearing an elegant, yet relaxed, floor-length black kaftan. To her left is a simple vase filled with overblown pale pink peonies, which signify love, romance, affection and happiness. Following her husband Sidney Myerâ€™s death in 1934, Myer established the Sidney Myer Charitable Trust (later Fund), was a Board member of the Royal Melbourne Hospital for four decades, and was a patron of many organisations. Pinned to Myerâ€™s dress in this portrait is her Badge of the Damehood of the Order of the British Empire, which she was awarded in 1960 for her service to the Red Cross and her tireless philanthropy for cancer and heart disease research.",

                            "In Pamela See (Xue Mei-Ling)â€™s _Making Chinese shadows (sixteen silhouette portraits)_, flowers are used as an allegory for the diasporic experience. See is a Chinese-Australian artist who questions, honours and investigates her cultural inheritance and family experience through her artistic practice. Her work connects the traditions of European silhouette portraiture and Chinese papercutting from Guangdong Province, where her motherâ€™s family originates. In the series of 16 intricate paper cuts from which these works derive, See represents members of the Chinese-Australian community who made major but often unrecognised contributions to society in the 19th century. See says of her motivation for making the portraits: â€˜these personal histories became invisible. So it wasnâ€™t just that they were excluded from parts of community life, they just were never recorded. They didnâ€™t exist, more or less.â€™ Each work incorporates a silhouette based on a photograph, an object representing their achievement, and a floral symbol of an introduced, invasive or endemic species including red silk cotton tree flower (symbolic of Guangdong Province), jasmine flower, common heath and hibiscus.",

See is a Chinese-Australian artist who questions, honours and investigates her cultural inheritance and family experience through her artistic practice. Her work connects the traditions of European silhouette portraiture and Chinese papercutting from Guangdong Province, where her motherâ€™s family originates. In the series of 16 intricate paper cuts from which these works derive, See represents members of the Chinese-Australian community who made major but often unrecognised contributions to society in the 19th century. See says of her motivation for making the portraits: â€˜these personal histories became invisible. So it wasnâ€™t just that they were excluded from parts of community life, they just were never recorded. They didnâ€™t exist, more or less.â€™ Each work incorporates a silhouette based on a photograph, an object representing their achievement, and a floral symbol of an introduced, invasive or endemic species including red silk cotton tree flower (symbolic of Guangdong Province), jasmine flower, common heath and hibiscus.",

                            "Photographer Jesse Lizotte wanted to create a portrait of Jimmy Barnes AO (b. 1956) and Jane Barnes (b. 1958) that signifies their enduring love and challenges conventional â€˜rock and rollâ€™ depictions of the singer. In this photograph, he captures the tenderness between the spouses as they lie quite literally on a bed of roses. Lizotte, who is also Jimmy and Janeâ€™s nephew, recalls asking them for references for the portrait: â€˜Jane had come to me with a French love poem, alongside a series of paintings by Chagall ... I wanted to create a floating illusion, and to incorporate the roses that Jimmy picks from their garden and arranges for Jane every day.â€™ Not just a romantic backdrop, the couple often give each other rose bushes for their garden as gifts for special occasions. The metaphor of the rose is not lost on them. Considering the flower in relation to their relationship, the couple observed: â€˜Itâ€™s not always a bed of roses. Itâ€™s not always easy, thereâ€™s thorns ... but itâ€™s about living through that and sharing those experiences.â€™",

So we created this â€¦\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** Rose garden\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** â€¦ amazing rose garden.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** Yeah weâ€™ve got these beautiful roses that obviously are brought to us with love and every day I'd go and pick them, roses for Jane all through lockdown. And every day I'd pick a new bunch and say, look at this, isn't this great? And they smell beautiful. And that was sort of my way of reaching out to Jane every day and letting her know I loved her. And it was a simple thing. And I just loved the fact that these roses kept growing in our garden.\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** And you could pick a hundred of them.\\n\\n**Jesse Lizotte:** Well, on the day you brought like wheelbarrows full, you came into the photo studio with just tonnes of roses.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** It was beautiful.\\n\\n**Jesse Lizotte:** Yeah, we had too many. It smelt great.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** And that whole metaphor, thereâ€™s a portrait about love and the whole metaphor of the roses and things, you know love's not always easy â€¦\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** A bed of roses.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** â€¦ it's not always a bed of rose, it's not always easy â€¦\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** Its full of thorns.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** ... it takes work.

And I thought it was â€¦\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** And adventures and wonderful things as well.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** I thought it was a great metaphor with the roses.

                            "- I wanted to do their love story justice too, you know. How, how do you capture that and sum it up in a picture? But I wanted to, to pic Jimmy in a way that, you know we're not often used to seeing him. I wouldn't say submissive is the word, but he's, looks, at peace and very calm and,\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- and gentle, you know, his eyes are closed. He's being embraced. Well, he's embracing Jane. They're almost like a, a ying and yang. And I feel like that's what my auntie is to, to my uncle's.\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- You know, she balances his energy out.\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- Because we're used to seeing pictures of him and he is a tough guy and he does scream on stage.\\n\\n- But that's not, who I know.\\n\\n- That's what I do. That's what I do there.\\n\\n- But, you know, I'm not, not like that at home. I'm, you know,\\n\\n- No.\\n\\n- I'm different at home. Because we're close, we, you know, but we'd spoke about the actual doing the photograph and what we wanted to achieve with it as well, didn't we?\\n\\n- [Jesse] Yeah.\\n\\n- It was sort of, you know, Jane had a lot of, a lot of input.\\n\\n- Oh, well, the idea was Elizabeth's poem. We had a beautiful French friend who wrote a, a love story. Yeah.\\n\\n- Of, of us, how she saw our love and she put together this little book of Marc Chagall, Marc Chagall and Bella. It really sort of spoke something about our relationship.\\n\\n- [Jesse] Yeah.\\n\\n- But then, you came up with the idea of Uncle Jimmy's Roses.\\n\\n- We have a beautiful garden at home. And the rose patch particularly, that's the only one I can look, sort of look after, because I'm not not that great a gardener. But friends would give us, give me roses, instead of,\\n\\n- Yeah, for your 60.\\n\\n- we don't want gifts.\\n\\n- What happened was, everybody brought rose.\\n\\n- Yeah. For me, for as, as a-\\n\\n- So we created this,\\n\\n- Rose garden,\\n\\n- amazing rose garden.\\n\\n- They grow so well. I, I don't do that much, but I would go down and and pick roses for, for Jane all through lockdown. And every day I'd, I'd pick a new bunch and say, look at this. Isn't this great?\\n\\n- You know, and this smell beautiful, like these, like these are from the garden. And the whole metaphor of the roses and you know, things, you know, love's not always, you know, easy,\\n\\n- a bed of roses.\\n\\n- It's not always a bed of roses. It's not always easy,\\n\\n- Sort of thorns.\\n\\n- And it takes work.\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- And there's thorns. It's not always gonna, it's not always gonna be great. But the, but it's about living through that and, and sharing those experiences.\\n\\n- [Jane] There's many layers too.\\n\\n- [Jesse] Mm.\\n\\n- [Jimmy] Yeah. And all the symbols in that. Just in the roses, coming from our garden.\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- And you know, Jesse being involved, like you said, just the family capturing, and he knows us, you know and he's known us all his life and through, he knows our warts and all, you know and we're individuals there too. And that's just, all these messages are important.\\n\\n- Mm hmm.\\n\\n- You know, the bed of roses, the, the you've got to fight those thorns. All of that.\\n\\n- Mm.\\n\\n- [Jesse] For me, it started quite young, photography. I was like eight or nine years old. A family friend of ours, Wendy McDougall, she put a camera in my hand and, and I just thought it was magic. You know, as a kid, eight or nine years old, we'd go out and I'd take pictures and then she'd develop them in the dark room. And I just thought it was the coolest thing ever, you know to be able to freeze moments in time. And, and, and so she had a huge influence on me for sure. You know, but, also just my father and, and my uncle. Their work ethic, you know, and just their prolific output you know, that has been a huge impact on me. And, and seeing, seeing their dedication to their craft and just how relentless they are with that, I think.\\n\\n- I think music and, and photography and music and art, and and the, the all sort of expressions of the soul. And, and, and it even down to the fact of, you know like working together and make album covers and think some the best album covers are made working together within the family. Writing songs with, with, with Jesse's dad.\\n\\n- It's a blessing, isn't it?\\n\\n- It's really,\\n\\n- That you have that. it's really incredible.\\n\\n- Mm.\\n\\n- And when you get to work\\n\\n- Be able to work.\\n\\n- with people that\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- you're that close to, they, you know, there's there's just this understanding and, and, and, and ease. And you know, that you and I think they're just all expressions of love and the soul, you know, and they bring people together.\\n\\n- Well, they're nearly everyone in the family's a musician or an artist. So I felt like I sort of rebelled by not,\\n\\n- You're an artist. pursuing music. Well in the end, I, I,\\n\\n- Oh yeah.\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- I suppose, you know, I, yeah, like chose a creative path. But I remember going to the Portrait Gallery on school excursions and, and seeing the works hung on the walls and just thought it was so monumental, almost, you know, somewhat unattainable. I thought, wow, it'd be nice to see my pictures hung here but I could never see that happening, you know? And so I was very, I was very blessed to, you know, get the opportunity to shoot Jane and Jimmy, who were, you know, who very dear to me. And I'm very grateful for that.\\n\\n- I find, like in this photo there's something that's sort of the message that I tell young singers and stuff, that, the best singing or the best creating you'll ever do comes with ease. And it's relaxed and it's, it's in a moment that's not forced or stressed or, and I think this, this image sort of has that you know, it's, it's real.\\n\\n- Real.\\n\\n- But, you know, and, and if you if you find that peace when you, like, whether you're on stage or in a recording studio or in, in a photo. If you find that peace, it becomes easy. The work, work becomes, the passion becomes the what you love. And it's, you know, it doesn't, it's not work anymore. And I think that's sort of part of what shows in that photo.\\n\\n- All you need is love.\\n\\n- I don't know, it's a bit cheesy, but, you know, love endures. It lasts.\\n\\n- Yeah.",

                            "Bidjara man Dr Christian Thompson AO has featured native flowering plants in his photographs to explore kinship, culture and connection to Country since the late 2000s. The multi-panel photograph _The Shortest Day_ depicts a large-scale flower-wall, or floral constellation, within which the artist appears partially obscured by flora. Powerfully connecting the artist to nature and history, the work enacts a dynamic dialogue about identity alongside ideas of visibility and invisibility â€“ of being seen and unseen. Through his declarative self portraiture, Thompson takes control of how First Nations people are represented, dismantling the legacies of ethnographic photography. \\n\\nThis is the first work that Thompson made following the failed Voice referendum of October 2023. Rather than his usual vibrant living blooms, it is an abundance of dried botanical specimens that envelop the artist. The photograph is sombre and reflective, its stillness interrupted only by the billowing ribbons. Referencing the hot desert air that Thompson fondly remembers from his childhood, the ribbons here symbolise hope in moving forward.",

                            "Deeply embedded in her SÄmoan heritage, much of Angela Tiatiaâ€™s work critiques the commodification of Pacific Island women in Western popular culture. In _Hibiscus rosa sinensis_ the artist appears surrounded by lush foliage in close up, a bright red hibiscus protruding from her mouth. In traditional SÄmoan culture the hibiscus, when placed behind the ear, can signify relationship status and sexual availability. Behind the right means youâ€™re looking; behind the left means youâ€™re taken. In this video work, however, Tiatia creates a counternarrative. Challenging the stereotype of the sexually alluring â€˜dusky maidenâ€™, Tiatia stares steadily at the viewer and literally eats the myth. Tiatiaâ€™s consumption of this symbolically loaded bloom is an exercise in taking power back â€“ she situates herself as protagonist and rejects the colonial gaze.",

For _In Bloom_, Cosgrave has repurposed her 2010 installation _Red Flower Wall Painting_ as a wallpaper named _He Putiputi Kura_ (meaning â€˜some scarlet red flowersâ€™ in Te reo MÄori). The work originated as a template that the artist projected onto the wall and then painted by hand, resulting in a constellation of flowers that warped and weaved organically through the space. This undulating floral effect has here been transformed into a wallpaper that punctuates the galleries in which the _In Bloom_ exhibition is displayed. This work also sits in dialogue with Polly Borlandâ€™s photograph of Queen Elizabeth II, which features the Finnish Marimekko-brand wallpaper Unikko.",

He began his 40-year partnership with The Australian Ballet in 1964 and collaborated regularly with Graeme Murphy for the Sydney Dance Company (SDC), Melbourne Theatre Company and Opera Australia. On the 50th anniversary of the SDC in 2019, Murphy recollected that dancer and co-artistic director of the SDC Janet Vernon would hang Frederiksonâ€™s costume illustrations on her dressing room mirror. â€˜They were so exquisitely drawn that when she was doing her make-up and psyching up for the show, they would take her straight into the world she needed to inhabit. Itâ€™s wonderful when a costume is not something you throw on but a doorway to the character you become on stage.â€™\\n\\nPeter Brew-Bevanâ€™s portrait shows the designer at home, surrounded by shelves overflowing with books and CDs. Notoriously private, Fredrikson looks at the camera with one hand covering half his face.",

At 14 he was the youngest male dancer to be accepted into The Australian Ballet School; he went on to dance with The Australian Ballet, Englandâ€™s Royal Ballet and Les Ballets FÃ©lix Blaska in France. Over the years he has created productions for companies including Opera Australia, Shanghai Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. \\n\\nLewis Morley took this photograph during Murphyâ€™s first year as artistic director of The Dance Company (as the SDC was then known). Over four decades with the company, Murphy created a repertoire of more than 50 works. He explained his creative process during a 2020 conversation with David McAllister: â€˜It comes out of the deepest recesses of my subconscious, my movement, and if it doesnâ€™t relate, then I donâ€™t have a continuity within.â€™",

He has also appeared in the film _Maoâ€™s Last Dancer_, directed _Julius Caesar_ for Victorian Opera, and choreographed _Tosca_ for Opera Australia. When interviewed in 2016 for _The Australian Ballet: The Ballet Men Issue_, Heathcote described the physicality of dance. â€˜One of the things I always loved was that pursuit of athleticism, pushing hard physicallyâ€™ he said. â€˜I really enjoyed roles like Romeo, because itâ€™s highly physical â€“ the partnering, but then also the sword-fighting and all that boy stuff. I used to love that.â€™",

                            "- If I had my choice when it comes to taking portraiture, I'd rather have 45 minutes of conversation, and then jam in 15 minutes of image making because that conversation or getting to know someone lowers the temperature in the room, trust becomes a thing, then I start to conjure up ideas, and particularly if I'm in a panic 'cause I generally am in a state of panic of how I'm gonna make an interesting image. Originally, I was going to be an illustrator. So that was something that I always, always planned to do. I was never gonna do anything different, I was obsessed with illustration. So I went all through my high school years, went to art school, lasted one year in a fine art degree, and then the dark room was a side project as part of my degree, and then I got stuck into the dark room. And was just the magic of the dark room and all of a sudden, that laboriousness of illustration versus the instant gratification of photography, and it filled a big hole, filled an artistic hole, and I just went this is what I'm gonna do. And then just fortuitously there was a little tiny little ad in the newspaper before phones and it said cadetship, dark room assistant at the Herald Newspaper, and I went well, I'm just gonna make a folly out of work and I'm just gonna turn up and I'm just gonna apply for this job, and I got this job as a cadetship which is now known as an internship. And then yeah, just sort of grew from that. Yeah, so that's how the photography, like that part started. I'm such a curious person about people, and stories, and mannerisms. So before I even pick up a camera, I think I like having a conversation. That's really strange. I like hearing them talk and I watch them, and without realising, I think I'm observing those little, quiet nuances in between the big gestures, and that's the stuff that I tend to hone in on. I don't know why. I know it sounds a bit weird but it's sort of like this little trance-y moment where I go from the person walks in the room, does that, sits down, introduces themself, and then starts to relax, and then do things, and then I latch onto that, and then I hone that. It's like a dance but I try and lead the dance, I give and take. And then once they're really comfortable with me, then I start to talk about what we might do as an image, but I never go in with preconceived ideas, I know that. I'm bad if I come up with an idea and walk in 'cause it's not gonna work. I rely on what they do in front of me, and that is a cue for me. I describe my work as quiet, and I think that I look for those little, quiet gestures in between the bigger gestures like if someone's quite verbose and quite a loud talker because either that's who they are or they're insecure, I wait for that to calm down, and then I start to infiltrate my little bit, and then I hone in on that part of their personality. I try to yeah, I'll throw all that stuff aside and just put everything into that little moment, that little, tiny nuance, the quiet, little moment, which is what I love. Yeah, so that's what I'm hunting for and it is chance. It always ends up being chance. I shoot with my digital camera and the first thing that people say to me is don't you need to check the back of your screen? And I go no, 'cause it'll just throw me off my game. 'Cause if I see too much, I start to doubt myself. I think I just like living in that dream scape of I don't know what I'm gonna get, and that was the great thing about film, was you wind it on, I don't know, I think it was good? Pull the dark slide, it looked good. So I think I had that innate trust because I was lucky enough to have been trained in film and trust what was gonna come out at the other end, that you were gonna get something from those 36 frames at some point, you only need one really great shot. Whereas digital, 2000, 3000, I can't ever ... I shoot digital like I shoot film. I think people think I'm lazy and I shoot and I'm taking pictures of people digitally and I go all right, we're done, they go is that it? And I go well, was that disappointing? And I go I'm sorry if I disappointed you but I'm happy! So I still shoot digital like I'm shooting film, like it's the war and I've gotta ration it. But for me, that's where I love photography, that's where I love it. That's like watching the print come up.",

00:03:08.430\\nI'm bad if I come up with an idea and walk in\\n\\n57\\n00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.140\\n'cause it's not gonna work.\\n\\n58\\n00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.010\\nI rely on what they do in front of me,\\n\\n59\\n00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.903\\nand that is a cue for me.\\n\\n60\\n00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.433\\nI describe my work as quiet,\\n\\n61\\n00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.190\\nand I think that I look for those little, quiet gestures\\n\\n62\\n00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.350\\nin between the bigger gestures\\n\\n63\\n00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.300\\nlike if someone's quite verbose and quite a loud talker\\n\\n64\\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.622\\nbecause either that's who they are or they're insecure,\\n\\n65\\n00:03:39.622 --> 00:03:42.690\\nI wait for that to calm down,\\n\\n66\\n00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.690\\nand then I start to infiltrate my (laughs) little bit,\\n\\n67\\n00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.230\\nand then I hone in on that part of their personality.\\n\\n68\\n00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.118\\nI try to yeah, I'll throw all that stuff aside\\n\\n69\\n00:03:56.118 --> 00:03:58.500\\nand just put everything into that little moment,\\n\\n70\\n00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.670\\nthat little, tiny nuance, the quiet, little moment,\\n\\n71\\n00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.960\\nwhich is what I love.\\n\\n72\\n00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.100\\nYeah, so that's what I'm hunting for and it is chance.\\n\\n73\\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.143\\nIt always ends up being chance.\\n\\n74\\n00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.780\\nI shoot with my digital camera\\n\\n75\\n00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.180\\nand the first thing that people say to me\\n\\n76\\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.450\\nis don't you need to check the back of your screen?\\n\\n77\\n00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.203\\nAnd I go no, 'cause it'll just throw me off my game.\\n\\n78\\n00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.460\\n'Cause if I see too much, I start to doubt myself.\\n\\n79\\n00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.730\\nI think I just like living in that dream scape\\n\\n80\\n00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.340\\nof I don't know what I'm gonna get,\\n\\n81\\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.960\\nand that was the great thing about film,\\n\\n82\\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.813\\nwas you wind it on, I don't know, I think it was good?\\n\\n83\\n00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.890\\nPull the dark slide, it looked good.\\n\\n84\\n00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.520\\nSo I think I had that innate trust\\n\\n85\\n00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.350\\nbecause I was lucky enough to have been trained in film\\n\\n86\\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.650\\nand trust what was gonna come out at the other end,\\n\\n87\\n00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.890\\nthat you were gonna get something from those 36 frames\\n\\n88\\n00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.150\\nat some point, you only need one really great shot.\\n\\n89\\n00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.150\\nWhereas digital, 2000, 3000, I can't ever ...\\n\\n90\\n00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.830\\nI shoot digital like I shoot film.\\n\\n91\\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.680\\nI think people think I'm lazy and I shoot\\n\\n92\\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.690\\nand I'm taking pictures of people digitally\\n\\n93\\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.850\\nand I go all right, we're done, they go is that it?\\n\\n94\\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.720\\nAnd I go well, was that disappointing? (laughs)\\n\\n95\\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.140\\nAnd I go I'm sorry if I disappointed you but I'm happy!\\n\\n96\\n00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.460\\nSo I still shoot digital like I'm shooting film,\\n\\n97\\n00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.433\\nlike it's the war and I've gotta ration it.\\n\\n98\\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.600\\nBut for me, that's where I love photography,\\n\\n99\\n00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.420\\nthat's where I love it.\\n\\n100\\n00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:48.053\\nThat's like watching the print come up.\\n\\n",

This image was taken during the shoot for the award-winning 60-second dance film _The Knowledge Between Us_, produced by the Samaya Wives. \\n\\nPippa Samaya explores the physicality of dance against the natural landscape in many of her films and photographs. Interviewed for _RealTime_ in 2017, Pippa described the role of dance in her work: â€˜dance allows me to capture things that are outside of myself and itâ€™s purely visual. Dance provided me a visual language for all those complex, inner emotional states of being human. It enabled me to express things that words canâ€™t and allows a level of empathy thatâ€™s otherwise difficult to find.â€™",

                            "After dancing with the Australian Dance Theatre and the UK-based DV8 Physical Theatre, Tanja Liedtke became an award-winning choreographer. She tragically died aged 29, on the eve of becoming the youngest director of Sydney Dance Company. To commemorate Liedtkeâ€™s life and work, her partner Sol Ulbrich and fellow dancers staged a world tour of her works _Construct_ and _Twelfth Floor_. As Ulbrich noted in the 2011 film _Life in Movement_, â€˜Thereâ€™s a lot to be said for giving everyone a chance to still speak through her voice. This is the thing that theyâ€™re left with, that they hold in their bodies.â€™\\n\\nThis photograph was taken during Liedtkeâ€™s performance in the Australian Dance Theatreâ€™s production of _Birdbrain_, directed by Garry Stewart.",

In an article for _Ausdance_ in 2000 Rowe recalled, â€˜My mother took me to my first ballet class at the age of 6.

                            "<span>Linda Burney:</span>\\n\\n<span>Looking at those pictures has taken me back to the early 80s when we were all so young, and really had no sense of the enormous lives that some of us would have. You know, it was a very different place for Aboriginal people in the 80s, but it was also a time when things were really starting to happen. I think what those photographs really demonstrate to me is a radical re-look at the way that Aboriginal people were being represented.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>I also look at every individual in the series â€“ all of them that I know, some of them that I am still very much in contact with â€“ and just think there was an alignment of the stars to bring us all together.</span>\\n\\n<span>Michael had an enormous influence on both my children. He was their uncle, and a connection between Michael and my children is very strong, so it's a very, very special photograph. And I remember Michael getting us to pose for that photograph. And I had no idea that it would become such an enduring image of the beauty that he could make.</span>\\n\\n<span>Brenda Croft:</span>\\n\\n<span>The image that day that he did with me and Dad... I can still remember that Dad's shirt had a big coffee stain on it, where he'd tipped his coffee on him. It didn't take very long. He just came in, took photographs. And I just, I love that image. You know, we used to go along to all the exhibitions that were on, around the traps. And Dad was there because he was friends with Ace, and Dad's, not bragging, but he was just really proud. And he was going 'Oh, you know, you've got to come to Michael's opening tomorrow night because you'll see an image ofÂ me and Brenda in it. Then Dad sort of wanders off somewhere and Michael's [under his breath] \"Brenda, Brenda, come 'ere, come 'ere\" and I went over and said \"What, what\" and he said 'I haven't printed it. What'll I do?\" And I just said, you know, \"Well if you want to make an old man happy, you'd better print it. So we did. We spent the entire night printing it in Sandy Edwards' studio, printing it by hand. So we framed it and and â€“ lucky for him â€“ Dad bought it at the opening.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>Darrell Sibosado:</span>\\n\\n<span>I actually love that image. For me, personally, it's one of the best photos I've seen of myself. It's the image that reflects me from that time, makes me think about it, you know, who I was at that time.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>So that day, I remember it was a bit organised. I kept saying yesterday I remember how disorganised Michael seemed. But this was a bit of a plan. But anyway, it was on the first floor, and we were in there, and it was quite simple. There was just him with a camera. He was so comfortable to be around. You know, even though he was quiet and everything, you knew it was a good quiet. It wasn't a quiet where he's thinking you're an idiot or anything like that. You know he's not thinking bad thoughts. And I just trusted him to do whatever he wants. So I just sat there and he took the photo and that's what came out.</span>",

                            "Dancer and choreographer Janet Vernon AM was co-artistic director of the Sydney Dance Company from 1976 to 2007 with her husband Graeme Murphy. In the early years they often danced together. Later, she danced with the company throughout the world, in roles and productions they had created together. In a 2015 interview with Kang Yena on _The INNERview_,Vernon said of working with dancers: â€˜Itâ€™s beautiful when you get a breakthrough. They own the movement really because no one else has done this. Itâ€™s just them and their body. I think once they can accept that, and start to feel more comfortable, itâ€™s a wonderful feeling as a dancer when you suddenly find a new way of moving, a new freedom, a new voice.â€™",

She first visited Australia on tour with the Ballets Russes in 1936, returning to Sydney two years later. In 1941 she established Kirsova Ballet, the first professional ballet company in Australia. In a 1940 _Sydney Morning Herald_ article about the opening of the school she said, â€˜there is plenty of talent here. There is also a great deal of appreciation for the ballet, and I think that appreciation can be intensified by greater knowledge of the tradition and meaning of balletâ€™. Kirsova created original ballets and was an important patron of Australian composers, set designers, artists and photographers.

                            "Anna Pavlova was principal artist of the Russian Imperial Ballet, beloved for her famed creation of _The Dying Swan_. After forming her own ballet company in 1911, Pavlova performed to great acclaim around the world. Her company of about 40 dancers made two tours to Australia in 1926 and 1929.  \\n\\n\\nAs a teenager, Robert Helpmann danced with the legendary ballerina on her first Australian tour. In an interview with Hazel de Berg for the National Library of Australia he described the dedication and hard work of the great dancer: â€˜I used to go to the theatre at half past five and standing on a barely lit stage covered in woollen tights and pullovers and shawls would be this lonely figure practising â€¦ I often wonder whether the audience realised for one second the amount of work you have to do to become an Anna Pavlova.â€™ \\n\\nWhile Pavlova avoided the press, she commissioned leading Australian photographer Harold Cazneaux to photograph her while performing in Sydney. In this portrait she is posed backstage in costume for _Don Quixote_.",

She sees one of the principles of Acehnese dance, a traditional style from Indonesiaâ€™s northern province, â€˜is to dance as one body, with one soulâ€™. Here dancers perform _Rapai Geleng_, a seated Acehnese dance that combines body percussion,hand drumming and singing. They work together to keep in rhythm, throwing the drum in the air for the next person to catch. Describing the interrelatedness of dance, Suara Indonesia dancer and choreographer Amelia Darmawan said, â€˜Dance connects your feet to the earth, your heart to each other and your soul to something greater.â€™",

                            "(Ms Lawford-Wolf speaking in language)\\n\\nI was sick and tired of white portrayal of Aboriginal people. And I wanted to write a theatre that was different, had all different forms of acting in it whether it be music, dance, singing, a monologue. And I wanted to stay in the traditional way of storytelling but make it real, make it different. And the only way, and the only way I can do stories like that was to fall back on myself and my plays, like â€˜You know, youâ€™ve got a story yourself, youâ€™ve been to Alaska when you were 16, you know, you lived here, you lived there, youâ€™ve come from Christmas Creek station, youâ€™ve come up from nowhere and make a name for yourself in the acting world and that is an achievement for someone my age. And I never really thought about it because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m anything special. I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m still quite naive in that aspect.\\n\\nI wanted to make it honest too, â€˜cos you look at a lot of Aboriginal people that are working out there, thereâ€™s a lot of Aboriginal women that are working but not really strong Aboriginal womenâ€™s stories. And I wanted to make my point of view as a woman and as a proud Aboriginal woman, proud of where I come from, whether than be the backblocks of Woop Woop but yet that place still has a very big significance for me. I wanted to make Australia realise that they do have an Indigenous culture in Australia. They have it here. No, no, and Australia doesnâ€™t need to go anywhere else and adopt someone elseâ€™s Indigenous culture which a lot of people tend to do. But, you know, they have it here. And nobody hasnâ€™t discovered it, itâ€™s so funny going to Europe, for me, and more European people know more about Aboriginal Australia than Australians do so which is quite sad, which is really really quite sad. It goes to show how ignorant white Australia is.",

Tchinarova first came to Australia with the Monte Carlo Russian Ballet in 1936. During that tour she was elated when ballet critic Arnold Haskell, writing for Melbourneâ€™s _Table Talk_, described her performance as â€˜brilliantâ€™, noting her â€˜aristocratically energetic movementâ€™. Tchinarova remained in Sydney after a second tour with Covent Garden Russian Ballet in 1938. During the 1940s she danced with three Australian companies, the Kirsova Ballet, the Polish-Australian Ballet and the Borovansky Ballet.",

                            "Dancer, choreographer, actor and filmmaker, Sir Robert Helpmann CBE was co-director then director of The Australian Ballet from 1965â€“76. During his celebrated career, Helpmannâ€™s dance partners included English ballerina Margot Fonteyn and Soviet-born ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev. He was renowned for his innovative choreography, such as his iconic 1964 ballet _The Display_, in which Barry Kitcher starred as the _Lyrebird_. As Kitcher reflected in his 2001 book _From Gaolbird to Lyrebird_: â€˜An infusion of excitement, apprehension and nerves spread through the new company as we awaited the arrival of Robert Helpmann â€¦ His formidable authority and flamboyant personality were legendary.â€™  \\n\\n\\nThis photographic montage resulted from David Mooreâ€™s short sitting with Helpmann in his Sydney hotel room in 1969. The cramped space limited Mooreâ€™s creative options, so he took these silhouettes against the window.",

                            "By this time the English ballet was growing in impetus and the houses were getting bigger and I was getting more than favourable press and Markova and I had formed a great partnership. Markova then decided to leave and start her own company with Anton Dolin. And I thought, â€˜Well this is the end of the balletâ€™, when Ninette de Valois said, â€˜Iâ€™ve found a girl that youâ€™re going to dance withâ€™, and took me into the classroom and I said, â€˜Which one?â€™ She said, â€˜That one over there with the two long plaitsâ€™, and I thought, â€˜That funny-looking little girl?â€™ and I said, â€˜Whatâ€™s her name?â€™ and she said, â€˜Peggy Hookhamâ€™, and I said, â€˜Well, thatâ€™s not going to look very good on the notice board is it, Peggy Hookham?â€™ And I said, â€˜She looks Chineseâ€™. And she said, â€˜Well as a matter of fact, she was born in Shanghai but she is English. No, she was born in Reigate and she went to Shanghai as a little girl â€“ I want you to work with herâ€™. And the minute, of course, I saw her dance, I realised that she was absolutely wonderful, and Ninette said, â€˜Sheâ€™s going to change her name, sheâ€™s going to call herself Margot Fonteynâ€™. And so from that moment on, I danced with Fonteyn for 27 years and I suppose we became, at that time, the most famous pair dancing in Europe.\\n\\nIâ€™m always asked what was the most memorable performance or production, and itâ€™s impossible really for me to say, because so many things have been memorable to me. My first appearances with Markova, my first appearances with Fonteyn, my first appearances with Vivienne Leigh, the first time I played _Hamlet_, all of them. I have never felt for one minute in my life, â€˜Iâ€™m a successâ€™. I feel Iâ€™ve accomplished something and that is done and therefore there is something more to do. The success or failure of what has passed has passed and I must go on to something else. And whatever else I may have achieved in life, I hope that people will remember that my whole life has been dedicated to producing something of beauty in the theatre.",

But for us itâ€™s not how we dance, or what we dance, but why we dance. In Aboriginal society, knowledge has always been passed from body to body. Dance is a way of making sense of the world. It is the storehouse of our knowledge, and the way we pay respect to our heritage. If knowledge is not passed on, the balance of our world becomes unhinged. Dancing is a matter of survival for Aboriginal culture.â€™",

                            "Bungaree (c. 1775â€“1830), voyager, navigator and diplomat, was among the most significant Sydney-area Indigenous leaders of the early colonial period. He arrived in Sydney from Broken Bay in the 1790s, soon becoming an intermediary between the Aboriginal community and the colonists. He made his first foray as a seafarer when he joined the _Reliance_ for a journey to Norfolk Island in 1798. In 1799, he travelled as far north as Bribie Island and Hervey Bay with Matthew Flinders, and in 1802 he sailed with Flinders again as a member of the _Investigator_ expedition, proving himself indispensable as a negotiator and for his knowledge of Aboriginal protocols. As a result of his participation in the _Investigator_ expedition, Bungaree reputedly became the first Aboriginal person to circumnavigate Australia. In 1817 he joined the surveying voyage along the southern coast of the continent led by Philip Parker King, who considered Bungaree 'sharp, intelligent', and 'of much service to us in our intercourse with the natives.' Governor Macquarie also valued Bungaree's skills as an intermediary and hoped that he would act as an example to his compatriots. To this end, Macquarie set aside land for Bungaree and his people at Middle Head, issuing them with farming equipment, clothing and a fishing boat to encourage the adoption of 'civilised' ways. Bungaree became well known for his wit and his practice of welcoming to his country ships entering Sydney Harbour. This, combined with the recognition of his standing in both communities, made him a favoured subject for portraitists and several early colonial artists created images of him. Augustus Earle's c. 1826 painting of Bungaree is among Australia's earliest portraits in oil on canvas, and Earle's lithograph of the painting is regarded as the first printed portrait produced in New South Wales. Bungaree died in Sydney in November 1830 after a long illness."

                            "Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (1926â€“2022) was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, who subsequently became King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Born on 21 April 1926 in London, she grew up there and at Windsor and was ten years old when the abdication of her uncle, Edward VIII, and her fatherâ€™s accession to the throne made her heir presumptive. Educated at home, the Princess was a Girl Guide and a Sea Ranger and began taking on public engagements at age sixteen. During the Second World War, when the Royal Family were looked to as champions of stoicism and resilience, she made her first broadcast on the BBC: a morale-boosting message to the many children evacuated from London during the Blitz. She was photographed tending to her vegetable garden at Windsor as part of the 'Dig For Victory' campaign; and in 1945 she joined the Auxiliary Territory Service, the women's branch of the British Army, rising to the equivalent rank of captain. In 1947, aged 21, she married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten â€“ the son of Prince Andrew of Greece and a great-great grandson of Queen Victoria â€“ who was created HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. She and her husband set out for Australia and New Zealand in 1952; on the way, in Kenya, Elizabeth received news of her father's death. She returned to England and was 27 on her coronation at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953, which was broadcast on the BBC to more than 20 million people around the world.\\n\\nDuring her reign Her Majesty was the Head of State of the United Kingdom and fifteen other Commonwealth countries. She was the first reigning British monarch to visit Australia, making sixteen visits here between her first in 1954 â€“ when she and Prince Philip took in 57 cities and towns between Hobart and Cairns in 58 days â€“ and her last, in 2011. She held weekly audiences with fourteen different British Prime Ministers (from Winston Churchill to Boris Johnson), spent time with all but one of the last fourteen sitting US Presidents (from Harry Truman to Joe Biden), and held meetings with seven different Popes. She was patron of more than 600 charities and organisations across the UK, attended hundreds of public engagements each year and undertook many historic overseas visits. A constant and enduring figure, she was widely respected for her unceasing commitment to her role â€“ which, along with her popularity, has been cited as a major contributing factor to the success of the No vote in the 1999 referendum on whether Australia should become a republic. In September 2015 she surpassed the record set by her great-great grandmother Queen Victoria to become Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch; and on the 70th anniversary of her accession in 2022 she became the first British monarch to mark a Platinum Jubilee.\\n\\nThroughout her 70-year reign, Her Majesty represented graciousness, humanity and stability during times of enormous social change. One of history's greatest women and one of the most significant and influential figures of the twentieth century, her death at the age of 96 on 8 September 2022 prompted mourning around the world, along with unanimous expressions of gratitude and respect for her decades of devotion to duty and public service."

I couldn't talk, I couldn't remember anything, you know I went into this kind of other zone, and completely overwhelmed that all of a sudden the Queen is there who is differentiated by blood. You know, more than just fame, but this woman has a bloodline that is different. And even though I'm not a royalist I was like â€˜Oh my godâ€™. Finally when I found my voice I just started babbling on but she was in a hurry. She was late. She had to go and host a lunch and I'd been told she doesn't really like being photographed. So she just wanted to get it over and done with. And sheâ€™s in front of the camera and Iâ€™m still talking. And then all of a sudden, the minder calls, â€˜two minutesâ€™. And I hadn't taken one roll of film. So he completely stitched me up. And then I just went into total panic. Took one roll. And at one point, I needed her to step to the left and I couldn't think of left. So I was down on my knee, hands and knees, trying to grab her ankles. Luckily, my husband stepped in and said, â€˜No, ma'am, Polly means step to the leftâ€™, grabbed me and got me back behind the camera. I mean, the whole thing was just a total kind of joke. And then she sees the floral background and she goes, â€˜Oh, I like thatâ€™. And also the ring flash was super bright. So by the time she left, she said, â€˜Oh, I think you've blinded meâ€™. And it's a miracle that I got two good photos, a miracle. And that really was the end of my portrait career. Interestingly, even though it was sort of like, probably the pinnacle â€“ I was commissioned by the palace, she's probably one of the most famous women in the world â€“ it kind of was almost like, well, I've done that. And I don't really need to keep doing it.",

                            "Trukanini (c. 1812â€“1876) is arguably nineteenth century Australiaâ€™s most celebrated Indigenous leader. A Nuennone woman and the daughter of Mangana, chief of the Recherche Bay people, Trukanini experienced the loss of her mother, sister and intended husband â€“ all as a result of white violence â€“ at a young age. Believing that she might be able to assist in protecting her people, in 1829 Trukanini joined the group of Palawa leaders associated with George Augustus Robinson, an evangelically-inclined free settler who'd been appointed to effect the removal of Tasmania's Aboriginal people to a mission station, Wybalenna, on Flinders Island in Bass Strait. Trukanini remained one of Robinson's most important companions throughout the course of his so-called 'Friendly Mission', the name given to a series of journeys conducted by Robinson between 1830 and 1835. Trukanini went to Wybalenna in 1835, but held to her traditional ways despite the expectation that the Aboriginal people there would adopt European customs and religion. She travelled with Robinson in 1839 to the Port Phillip district, where she later engaged with four others in raids against white settlers. She returned to Flinders Island in 1842; when Wybalenna closed in 1847, Trukanini was among the remaining residents relocated to Oyster Cove, a former convict depot south of Hobart and close to her traditional country. Trukanini died in Hobart in May 1876. As she had feared, her skeleton was stolen from her grave and later displayed at the Tasmanian Museum. The Tasmanian Aboriginal community eventually won the fight to have her wishes honoured: her bones were cremated on the 30th of April 1976 and the following day her ashes were scattered with due ceremony on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Trukanini was erroneously referred to during her lifetime and beyond as the â€˜last Tasmanianâ€™ â€“ a false notion attested to by the many descendants of her contemporaries still living in Tasmania today."

                            "Wurati (active 1830s, d. 1842), was a Nuennone man from Bruny Island, a skilled hunter, boat builder and renowned storyteller who spoke five dialects. In 1829 Wurati decided to join the party associated with George Augustus Robinson (1788â€“1866), a free settler and lay preacher appointed to the position of â€˜Conciliator of Aboriginesâ€™ so as to effect the removal of Tasmaniaâ€™s Indigenous people to Flinders Island in Bass Strait. This strategy had been conceived by the colonial government, amidst escalating hostilities, for the supposed protection of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities alike. Accompanied by a group of Aboriginal leaders who acted as his guides and interpreters, Robinson conducted a series of expeditions â€“ collectively known as the Friendly Mission â€“ between 1830 and 1835, during which the surviving tribes were persuaded into exile. Wurati and his second wife, Trukanini, became Robinsonâ€™s trusted assistants, yet remained fiercely proud of their traditions and identity. Wurati refused to adopt European diet or dress and maintained traditional practices, such as the use of ochre and grease for his hair and beard, even while at Wybalenna â€“ the mission station on Flinders Island to which over one hundred Tasmanian Aboriginal people were eventually exiled. Many died there while waiting for the fulfilment of the promise that they would be allowed to return to their country. In 1839, Wurati was one of the fourteen Tasmanians who went to Port Phillip following Robinsonâ€™s appointment to the position of Chief Protector of Aborigines in the new colony. He died on his return journey to Wybalenna in July 1842."

                            "The Australian Tapestry Workshop (formerly the Victorian Tapestry Workshop) was established in 1976, following two years of planning and research on the part of its founding patrons, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch and Lady Joyce Delacombe. It is the only centre of its kind in Australia, and one of the very few in the world that are able to undertake the weaving, by hand, of large-scale, contemporary tapestries for architectural locations. With an emphasis on collaboration with living artists and architects, the Workshop facilitates an understanding of tapestry as an innovative and experimental practice rather than just a traditional, technical, and creatively-subservient skill. Over its 45 years of operation, ATW weavers have created more than 500 tapestries in collaboration with artists including Brook Andrew, Sally Smart, Reg Mombassa, TextaQueen, John Olsen, David Noonan, Janet Laurence, Guan Wei, Nell, and Ginger Riley Manduwalawala; and from designs based on original works in various mediums including painting, photography, watercolour and collage. Among the ATW's many major public works are Sally Smart's _Eye Desire_ (2011), commissioned for the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne; _The games children play_ by Robert Ingpen, commissioned in 2009 in honour of Dame Elizabeth Murdoch's support of Melbourneâ€™s Royal Children's Hospital; the colossal tapestry designed by Arthur Boyd for the Great Hall at Parliament House, Canberra; JÃ¸rn Utzon's _Homage to Carl Philip Emmanuel Bach_ (2003) for the Sydney Opera House; the series of tapestries designed by Roger Kemp for Great Hall of the National Gallery of Victoria's St. Kilda Road building; and the seven-metre-wide tapestry, also by Robert Ingpen, created to mark the Melbourne Cricket Club's sesquicentenary. ATW tapestries are held in corporate and private collections here and overseas, and in major public collections including those of the National Gallery of Australia, the Australian War Memorial and the National Library of Australia. Currently, there are ATW tapestries on display at nine Australian Embassies around the world, and in 2020 Kaantju/Umpila artist Naomi Hobson was commissioned to design a tapestry for the Australian Embassy to Indonesia in Jakarta. The Workshop also provides resources for weavers, maintains a program of exhibitions and site visits, and in 2015 it instituted the international Tapestry Design Prize for Architects."

                            "Dalton's Royal Photographic Gallery was one of the names for the studio run by Edwin Dalton from 1858 until the mid 1860s. A painter, photographer and lithographer, Dalton had spent some time in America before coming to Australia in the 1850s, possibly in search of gold. He set up as portrait painter in Melbourne and by 1855 was in Sydney, specialising in works in pastel. In Sydney, Dalton attracted commissions from the city's most prominent families, his likenesses deemed so life-like as to be 'almost laughable'. In December 1858 he advertised his 'invention', the crayotype or crayongraph, a photograph coloured over with pastel. By June 1863 demand for his portraits far exceeded his capacity to supply them; by 1865 he had sold his business, which continued to operate under his name, and returned to England."

                            "Will Huxley grew up in the suburbs of Perth, Western Australia, and Garrett Huxley was raised on the Gold Coast, Queensland. After university, where they both studied photography â€“ Will at Edith Cowan University and Garrett at the Queensland College of Art â€“ the artists gravitated to Melbourne where they met in 2006. The pair soon began to collaborate as The Huxleys, combining their separate practices of photography, filmmaking and costume design, with performance as a key element. Inspired by the attention-grabbing and the outrageous, the artists embrace the glamourous, the absurd and the provocative and in doing so challenge convention; the Huxleys persuade their audience to consider notions of gender, social mores and non-conformity. The artists have become part of a contemporary cohort of collaborating duos, which includes the British pair Gilbert and George, and Australia's Charles Green and Lyndal Brown. The Huxleys continue to be in demand across the country and internationally, invited to work at the Art Gallery of South Australia, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Museum of Brisbane, National Gallery of Victoria, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Heide Museum of Modern Art, Arts Centre Melbourne, Australian Centre for the Moving Image, the Mona Foma festival in Tasmania and Sydney Contemporary. They were the inaugural 'Disrupters in Residence' at HOTA on the Gold Coast, and were included in a select group of Australian artists invited to participate in the City of Melbourne's UPTOWN. Internationally they have performed and exhibited in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Moscow and Berlin."

In 2017, she became only the second woman of colour to model bridal gowns for Chanel. The following year she featured in the Pirelli calendar, and made 33 appearances at Paris Fashion Week.

                            "Stephanie Alexander AO (b. 1940), cook, restaurateur, food writer and philanthropist, has been a major influence on Australian food and culinary culture for 50 years. Growing up at Rosebud on the Mornington Peninsula, where her father ran a caravan park, Alexander gained an interest in food and cooking from her mother, 'a wonderful cook who was not just interested in recipes, but in the culture that inspired the dish.' She has also recounted tending the family's vegie patch as a child, guided by her much-loved grandfather. After completing her school education, Alexander trained as a librarian, and at age 21 she set off on international travels that included a formative period in France. In 1966, with her then husband, she established The Jamaica House, a Lygon Street eatery specialising in curries and other West Indian dishes. It closed after a couple of years, at which point Alexander joined the team at Mietta's in North Fitzroy. In 1976 she established Stephanie's, also in Fitzroy, which within a few years had earned the reputation as Melbourne's home of exceptionally good, classic French food. 'Its $12 menu came at a time when no one had heard of goat's cheese and ginger came in a tin', one account of Stephanie's states, 'yet Alexander was surprising guests with violet petals in sorbet, lemon verbena-scented fish and dried marigold flavouring fish soup.' In 1980 she relocated the business to a Victorian-era mansion in Hawthorn. During the restaurant's seventeen years of operation there, Alexander published her first six books, among them _Stephanie's Feasts & Stories_ (1988) and _Recipes My Mother Gave Me_ (1997). In 2001, four years after Stephanie's closed, Alexander teamed up with a group called Cultivating Community to create a gardening and cooking course at a Collingwood primary school. With assistance from various bodies, including the Victorian Government, the project expanded, such that by 2010 there were kitchen garden programs operating in forty primary schools around the state. Alexander founded the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation in 2004 to coordinate the program, which is committed to introducing 'food education to children during their learning years, in order to form positive food habits for life.' Following an injection of funds from the Commonwealth Government, the program was taken up interstate, and as of 2018 it was reported that over 1200 primary schools and early learning centres around the country were participants. For her groundbreaking (no pun intended) work with the Kitchen Garden Foundation, Alexander was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2010. Meanwhile, the self-described 'accidental chef' had published another seven books including _The Kitchen Garden Companion_ (2009) and _The Tuscan Cookbook_ (2003), co-authored with travel companion and fellow cooking legend Maggie Beer. Alexander published the memoir _A Cook's Life_ in 2010, and her 1996 tome _The Cook's Companion_ ranks alongside The Margaret Fulton Cookery Book as the bible of any self-respecting Australian kitchen."

                            "Rick Amor (b. 1948) is a Victorian-based painter, printmaker and sculptor. Amor grew up in the Melbourne beachside region of Frankston and went to the National Gallery School, where he was taught by John Brack from 1966 to 1968. On graduation he won the drawing prize and the travelling scholarship.\\n\\nFrom 1973 to 1984 Amor lived in a cottage attached to the home of former National Gallery of Victoria director Daryl Lindsay and his wife Joan, author of _Picnic at Hanging Rock_, painting between carrying out odd jobs for the old couple. During this impecunious period he produced a series of cartoons attacking the Fraser government for the _Labor Star_ and the _Tribune_ and made series of drawings of labourers, construction workers and slaughtermen that were exhibited at the Trades Hall Gallery. \\n\\nFrom 1983 he began to paint more personal and emotionally charged works, often incorporating a haunting â€˜solitary watcherâ€™. Some of his brooding, shadowy paintings of suburban and inner Melbourne now number amongst the defining images of the city.\\n\\nAmor won the National Australia Bank Art Prize in 1988, and over the 1990s, awarded several art residencies, he worked in Barcelona, New York and London. By 1999 he had more than twenty solo commercial shows and several regional gallery survey shows to his name. That year, as Australia's first official war artist since Vietnam, he travelled to East Timor to document the devastated land and the reconstruction efforts of peacekeepers. The resulting works are in the collection of the Australian War Memorial. \\n\\nAmor shows regularly in commercial galleries in Melbourne and Brisbane and his paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures are in the collections of most major Australian public galleries. Along with commissioned and donated paintings - including one of his many grave self-portraits - the National Portrait Gallery has a number of his prints and drawings of his friends in Melbourneâ€™s serious artistic and literary circles.\\n\\nThe National Portrait Gallery curated the exhibition _Rick Amor 21 Portraits_ in 2014-2015."

The son of the shipping magnate and land developer George Fife Angas, he came to Australia from England in 1843 at his father's behest. His work over the next few years proved of such interest to people ignorant of the newly 'discovered' southern lands that he soon returned to present an exhibition in person to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In Piccadilly his works were complemented by Aboriginal and Maori costumes and implements, bird specimens, and a Maori orphan in native attire. In 1853 Angas became secretary to the Australian Museum, where he undertook cataloguing and research, particularly into shells. He returned to England in 1863."

                            "James Angus, born in Perth, Western Australia, has consistently explored the complexities inherent in traditions of Western sculpture. The first museum exhibition of Angus's work at Sydney's Museum of Contemporary Art in 1992 surprised viewers with its resolute and conceptually rigorous interrogation of spatial dynamics, and its engagement with the processes of industrial production. In the late 1990s Angus produced a number of sculptural works that represented carefully chosen animals and objects. A life-sized yellow fibreglass rhinoceros, pink rubber giraffe, and painted bronze dodos evoked perceptual complexity and analysed assumptions of scale and form. The very specific nature of the subjects of Angus's sculptures reflected their rich cultural and semiotic capacities. In 1999 he made several sculptures of a basketball and soccer ball where the use of computer-assisted design techniques enabled the artist to apply physical forces theoretically in virtual space. A real basketball was scanned in 3D and reproduced inside the computer; a soccer ball was created mathematically using computer design. These simulations were then subjected to theoretical velocity and force, captured at the moment of impact with the earth after being dropped from the cruising altitude of a 747 jet airliner, and reproduced as sculptures cast in plaster and bronze."

                            "Howard Arkley (1951-1999) was born, died, and spent the majority of his life in Melbourne, where he studied at Prahran CAE and Melbourne State College between 1969 and 1973. From 1975 until 1999 he exhibited at Tolarno Galleries. In 1977, Arkley was awarded residencies in Paris and New York. He came to see no sense in the Australian preoccupation with paintings of the bush, when such a small percentage of the population engages with the bush itself. Henceforth, Melbourneâ€™s suburbs provided the inspiration and setting for his best known works, made over twenty years of experimentation in an immaculately-finished, psychedelic and incandescent airbrush style. Arkleyâ€™s suite of interiors, _The Home Show_, was exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1999. Afterwards, he travelled to London to plan an album cover for Australian musician Nick Cave, and then to Los Angeles for a sell-out show of his paintings. He married his long-time partner, artist Alison Burton, in Las Vegas before returning to Melbourne, where he died from an overdose a few days later. Major retrospectives of his work were curated by Monash University Gallery in 1991 and NGV in 2006; his art was included in the National Gallery exhibition _Federation_ in 2000 and _Fieldwork: Australian art 1968-2002_ at the NGVA in 2002. Arkleyâ€™s painting of Nick Cave was one of the National Portrait Galleryâ€™s first commissions and remains one of the Galleryâ€™s signature images. His works are held by the National Gallery and most state collections."

                            "Atong Atem is a South Sudanese contemporary artist, born in Ethiopia, who lives and works in Naarm/Melbourne. Working primarily in photography, video and textiles, Atem explores migrant narratives and postcolonial practices in the African diaspora, the relationship between public and private spaces, and the exploration of home and identity through portraiture.\\n\\nAtemâ€™s family emigrated to NSWâ€™s Central Coast from South Sudan in 1997 when she was six years old. Living in Melbourne since 2014, Atemâ€™s work speaks to her sense of belonging and connection to her community in Australia and beyond.\\n\\nIn her portraits, in which she often depicts herself, Atem pushes against the impact of ethnographic photography and the images that defined representation from the 19th century onwards. Instead, Atong looks to the studio portraiture of mid-20th-century African photographers such as Malick SidibÃ© and Seydou KeÃ¯ta, for whom the medium provided a powerful means of resistance.\\n\\nReferencing these photographersâ€™ dynamic and vibrant compositions, as well as South Sudanese Dinka culture, Atem extends a lineage of photographic work that celebrated their subjects and returned agency to them. As she has said, â€˜Iâ€™m interested in the moment in history when black people took the camera and chose to photograph ourselves for ourselvesâ€™."

                            "Florence Austral (1892â€“1968), operatic soprano, achieved international renown during the 1920s. Born Florence Wilson in Richmond, Melbourne, she gave her first public performance as Florence Fawaz (her stepfather's surname) in a Christmas pageant around 1910. Her stepfather was duly impressed and arranged for her to have tuition in piano and voice; in 1913, she won a number of prizes in the annual South Street Competitions in Ballarat. She studied under Madame Elise Weiderman at the Conservatorium of Music in Albert Street and then at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1919. She left Australia and, following a disappointing stint in the United States, made her London debut in early 1921 at the Albert Hall. Like her Richmond compatriot, Nellie Melba, she adopted a name honouring her homeland and as Florence Austral debuted at Covent Garden in May 1922, replacing another patriotically named soprano, Elsa Stralia, in the role of BrÃ¼nnhilde in Wagner's _Die WalkÃ¼re_. During the 1920s and 1930s she toured North America and Australia and made the first of many recordings. The quality and power of her voice lent itself to the Wagnerian roles that secured her reputation, but she also performed in operas by Verdi, Mozart, Puccini and others. By the end of the 1930s, however, Austral was increasingly afflicted by multiple sclerosis. With her husband, Australian flautist John Amadio, she returned to Australia after the war and in the 1950s took up a teaching position at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music in Newcastle. She retired in ill health in 1959 and was admitted to an aged care facility in Newcastle in the early 1960s. The Florence Austral Association paid for her care until her death in May 1968."

                            "Murray Bail (b. 1941), writer, was born in Adelaide and spent several years in India and England in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In London, he began contributing pieces to the _Transatlantic Review_ and the _Times Literary Supplement_. His first book of short stories, _Contemporary Portraits and Other Stories_, was published in England in 1975, and reissued in 1986 as _The Drover's Wife and Other Stories_. His first novel _Homesickness_ (1980) won the National Book Council Award and shared the Age Book of the Year Award; _Holden's Performance_ (1987) won the 1988 Victorian Premier's Award for fiction. A trustee of the National Gallery of Australia for five years from 1976, Bail wrote a lyrical monograph on the artist Ian Fairweather in 1981, which was republished with significant revisions, including four extra chapters, in 2009. Described as 'one of our most remarkable fabulists', Bail has won critical acclaim and a number of major Australian literary honours, including the Commonwealth Writers' Prize and the Miles Franklin Award for the beguiling _Eucalyptus_ (1998), the story of a young woman whose prospective suitors must prove themselves by naming every species of eucalypt on her father's property. His subsequent novels include _The Pages_ (2008) and _The Voyage_ (2012). Bail's short fiction has been published regularly in journals such as _Meanjin_ and the _New Yorker_, and his output in non-fiction includes _Longhand: A Writer's Notebook_ (1989) and _Notebooks 1970â€“2003_ (2005). His collection of autobiographical writings, _He_, was published in 2021."

                            "Joseph Banks KCB (1743-1820), naturalist, grew up on his father's Lincolnshire estate, Revesby, but his lifelong interest in botany developed at Eton and Oxford. At the age of twenty-five, he suggested to the council of the Royal Society that they recommend him for inclusion on the voyage of the Endeavour. With Daniel Solander, he collected hundreds of specimens of plants and animals of the South Seas, of which many are depicted in the volumes which have come to be known as Banks' Florilegium. One of the great stars of eighteenth century London, Banks was President of the Royal Society for more than forty years, from 1778 to 1820. His association with Australia far outlasted the voyage with Cook: it was he who recommended it as a site for a penal settlement; he was a patron of Matthew Flinders and others; and his keen interest in Australian natural history was sustained through correspondence with all the early governors of New South Wales. At one point, Carl Linnaeus suggested that the continent be named Banksia. From 1788 to about 1810, though Banks held no official post, his role as de facto head of Australian affairs was widely acknowledged. During this period, he was deeply involved in schemes to drain the fens around Revesby, his family seat in Lincolnshire, through a system of canals. As the fens dried up, great stretches of pasture became available and Boston sheep fair became a major venture. Banks thus became keenly interested in sheep, particularly merinos (the volume The sheep and wool correspondence of Joseph Banks runs to nearly 700 pages) and he was designated Groom of His Majesty's Spanish Flock. He was involved with the first public sale of the breed on 15 August 1804, at which John Macarthur made significant purchases for his property at Camden, New South Wales."

We walked until we completely tired ourselves, seeing by the way only one Indian who ran from us as soon as he saw us.\\n\\nThe soil wherever we saw it consisted of either swamps or light sandy soil on which grew very few species of trees, one which was large, yielding a gum â€¦ but every place was covered with vast quantities of grass. We saw many Indian houses and places where they had slept upon the grass without the least shelter; in these we left beads, ribbons etc. We saw one quadruped about the size of a rabbit. My greyhound just got sight of him and instantly lamd [sic] himself against a stump which lay concealed in the long grass. We also saw the dung of a large animal that had fed on grass which much resembled that of a stag; also the footsteps of an animal clawed like a dog or wolf and as large as the latter.\\n\\nMay the second. The morn was rainy and we who had got already so many plants were well contented to find an excuse for staying on board to examine them. In the afternoon however, we returned to our old occupation of collecting, in which we had our usual good success. Tupia, who strayed from us in pursuit of parrots, of which he shot several, told us on his return that he had seen nine Indians who ran from him as soon as they perceived him.\\n\\nMay 3. Our collection of plants was now grown so immensely large that it was necessary that some extraordinary care should be taken of them. I carried all the drying paper, nearly 200 quires of which the larger part was full, ashore and spreading them upon a sail in the sun kept them in this manner exposed the whole day, often turning them. By this means they came on board at night in very good condition.",

                            "Jimmy Barnes AO (b. 1956), singer/songwriter, is a solo performer and the former lead singer of the quintessential Australian pub band, Cold Chisel. Born in Glasgow, Barnes immigrated to Adelaide with his family at age five. At seventeen Barnes joined Cold Chisel, which had been formed by Ian Moss, Steve Prestwich and Don Walker in 1973. After five years performing around the country, the band released the strong-selling _Cold Chisel_ (1978). They followed up with _Breakfast at Sweethearts_ before hitting the mainstream with _East_ (1980), which went triple-platinum. Two more albums were followed by a tour of the UK and the USA in late 1982, but international success eluded the band. They announced their disbandment in August 1983; a final tour was filmed as _Last Stand_, and their 'last' studio album, _Twentieth Century_, was released in 1984 (they reformed to make another in 1998). Their many live albums, compilations and EPs have combined to make Cold Chisel the only Australian band to have sold more records after they broke up than when they were together. After leaving Cold Chisel, Barnes became Jimmy Barnes and has since released twenty solo albums including _Flesh and Blood_ (2021) â€“ thirteen of them reached number one, the most in ARIA chart history. His two bestselling autobiographies, _Working Class Boy_ (2016) and _Working Class Man_ (2017), were followed by a book of non-fiction short stories, _Killing Time_ (2020) and a children's book, _Rosie the Rhinoceros_ (2021)."

We don't want gifts.\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** Yeah, for your 60th, what happened was everybody brought a rose. So we created this â€¦\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** Rose garden\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** â€¦ amazing rose garden.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** Yeah weâ€™ve got these beautiful roses that obviously are brought to us with love and every day I'd go and pick them, roses for Jane all through lockdown. And every day I'd pick a new bunch and say, look at this, isn't this great? And they smell beautiful. And that was sort of my way of reaching out to Jane every day and letting her know I loved her. And it was a simple thing. And I just loved the fact that these roses kept growing in our garden.\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** And you could pick a hundred of them.\\n\\n**Jesse Lizotte:** Well, on the day you brought like wheelbarrows full, you came into the photo studio with just tonnes of roses.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** It was beautiful.\\n\\n**Jesse Lizotte:** Yeah, we had too many. It smelt great.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** And that whole metaphor, thereâ€™s a portrait about love and the whole metaphor of the roses and things, you know love's not always easy â€¦\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** A bed of roses.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** â€¦ it's not always a bed of rose, it's not always easy â€¦\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** Its full of thorns.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** ... it takes work. And there's thorns, it's not always going to be great. But it's about living through that and sharing those experiences that makes love. You know, love takes work and love takes effort and love takes... you know, you have to give and take, you know. And I thought it was â€¦\\n\\n**Jane Barnes:** And adventures and wonderful things as well.\\n\\n**Jimmy Barnes:** I thought it was a great metaphor with the roses. And particularly because they came from our garden. They were the roses that we've been sharing for the previous years, you know.",

                            "Howard Barron (1900â€“1991), artist, was born in Kent, England. He arrived in Sydney in 1924 where he trained with Sir Will Ashton. Barron quickly gained a name as an outstanding landscape painter, working in the Newcastle area, around the Hawkesbury, Murrumbidgee and Wollondilly rivers and near Armidale. A regular finalist in the Wynne Prize, by 1933 his _Afternoon, Kangaroo Valley_ had been purchased by Sydney's National Gallery (the Art Gallery of New South Wales). Throughout the 1940s he became well known for his portraits and was a finalist in the Archibald Prize several times. After returning to England in the late 1940s, he was commissioned to paint portraits of prominent people including Sir Winston Churchill and Queen Elizabeth II. His portrait of Dame Nellie Melba hangs in Australia House, London. He returned to Australia in the late 1950s, where he lived until his death in 1991."

Having trained in engraving in Venice, he worked briefly in Rome before moving to London in 1764. Four years later he became a founding member of the Royal Academy.

                            "Del Kathryn Barton (b.1972) lives and works in Sydney. She is one of Australia's most celebrated contemporary artists, famous for her figurative paintings that feature fantastical characters posed against ornateâ€”and sometimes psychedelicâ€”backgrounds. Many of Barton's intricate paintings are focused on women, often surrounded by an abundance of flowers, fruit and other symbols of femininity, fertility and motherhood. On the occasion of the opening of a major retrospective of her work at the National Gallery of Victoria in 2018, Barton said: 'My greater oeuvre always speaks to different ways of inhabiting a female body in all of its complexities.'\\n\\nBarton has been a finalist in the Archibald Prize five times and won it twice: first in 2008 for a self-portrait with her children, then in 2013 for her painting of the actor Hugo Weaving, which is one of her few male portraits. Although Barton is best known for her paintings, she also works with collage, sculpture, textiles and video. In 2022, Barton released her first feature film, _Blaze_, which she co-wrote and directed."

She grew up in the Western suburbs of Sydney, where her parents instilled in her a passion for food. In 1970, she married Colin Beer and, three years later, the couple moved to the Barossa Valley in South Australia, which remains their home today. There, they started a farm and, in 1979, opened the Pheasant Farm Restaurant, offering simple meals made from scratch using only seasonal ingredients they grew themselves. This back-to-basics philosophy earned the restaurant a devoted following and critical acclaimâ€”it won the Remy Martin Cognac/Australian Gourmet Traveller Restaurant of the Year Award in 1991â€”while quietly revolutionising the Australian food industry, encouraging a greater focus on local produce and rustic, regional cuisine.\\n\\nAfter Beer closed Pheasant Farm Restaurant in 1993, she launched her own brand, Maggie Beer, which produces pÃ¢tÃ©, jams, wines, vinegars, verjuice and dozens of other products that are sold in Australia and around the world. Beer has also written several cookbooks and become a television presenter, appearing on programmes such as _The Cook and the Chef_, _The Great Australian Bake Off_ and _MasterChef Australia_. In 2010, she received the Senior Australian of the Year award for her work educating Australians about what they eat. Four years later, she created the Maggie Beer Foundation to enrich the lives of older Australians, especially those in aged care homes, through food."

Majoring in photography and printmaking, since graduating he has continued to make works on paper, holding regular solo exhibitions, including at the John Miller Galleries, Newcastle, at Grafton Regional Gallery and Lake Macquarie City Gallery, and participating in many in group exhibitions. As a photographer he has been a finalist in the Olive Cotton Prize (four times), the National Photographic Portrait Prize of 2014 and the Muswellbrook Photographic Prize, in which, in 2003, he took out both first and second prize. In the field of drawing, he has been a finalist in the Adelaide Perry Drawing Prize and won the Reg Russom Life Drawing Prize in 1994. Of his portraits, Beletich says, 'As a photographic artist, the main thread of my interest has always been portraiture. The challenge to convey a person, simply and honestly, is a pursuit that keeps me returning to this tradition.'"

She married Paul Haefliger, art critic, and after a period at the Westminster Art School, where her teachers included Mark Gertler, she returned to Sydney with Haefliger at the end of the 1930s. Here she built her reputation on neoclassical figures in landscapes, contributing illustrated articles to Art in Australia and teaching at the East Sydney Technical College. She won the Sulman Prize in 1942 and 1944. She and Haefliger bought a cottage in Hill End, New South Wales, and hosted many amongst the first wave of artists to the area. From 1957, the couple lived in Mallorca, Spain, where she painted some of her finest works. The Hill End cottage was bequeathed to the New South Wales government for use as an artists' retreat. Bellette is represented in all state galleries and in the National Gallery of Australia. A touring retrospective exhibition, featuring 75 works including works on paper and textiles as well as Bellette's writings and photographs, was mounted jointly by the Bathurst Regional Gallery and the SH Ervin Gallery in 2005."

A lot of other painters came back at the same time, so it was a very lively group, not by any means each one in agreement with the other, we had fantastic arguments about the why and wherefore of various theories. Everybody had to somehow earn their living, and it was rather a scramble but we did have a generous atmosphere amongst ourselves which perhaps doesnâ€™t exist in the same way today. When anybody did a good painting, whether you were a rival or not, or somebody was really not quite oneâ€™s friend, everybody went to look at the painting if everybody had come to the conclusion it was a very good painting. We regarded ourselves as a kind of brotherhood, sisterhood if you like, and watched each other with great attention and were glad when anybody got on better because it helped everybody else to get on better.\\n\\nOur friend Peter Bellew became art critic for the Sydney Morning Herald. I think then he had to do some naval work or other and could not go on with the art criticism so they asked my husband whether he would like to try his hand at writing art criticism for the paper. He immediately said, â€˜Oh, why donâ€™t you have my wife as art critic because she speaks the language and does writeâ€™, and the Herald said very charmingly and politely that they were not in the habit of employing women in this function as a critic, and couldnâ€™t contemplate the idea.",

In 1971 he was voted News Photographer of the Year, but three years later he began work at the new Department of Aboriginal Affairs, travelling the country to document Aboriginal social history. It was in this role that he took his iconic 1975 photograph of then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam pouring a handful of earth into the hand of Gurindji Elder and traditional land owner, Vincent Lingiari. In 1979 he returned to work at the _Herald_. From 1986 he has worked as a freelance photographer and lecturer. His retrospective exhibition, _In Dreams: Mervyn Bishop, Thirty Years of Photography 1960â€“1990_, initially curated by Tracy Moffatt, toured for a decade. He worked as a stills photographer on Phil Noyceâ€™s film _Rabbit Proof Fence_ (2002), and was awarded the Australia Councilâ€™s Red Ochre Award in December 2000. A major retrospective at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2017, _Mervyn Bishop_, combined his photojournalism and art works with the family photographs he took around Brewarrina in north-west New South Wales as a young man and on return visits. The exhibition later toured around Australia."

Dr Robert Black met Nora Heysen while she was a war artist in New Guinea. They finally married in 1953 after which she often travelled with her husband to tropical regions where she painted the local people. Black's major contributions were in the prevention and control of malaria in the armed forces, in Australia and in developing countries, working in conjunction with the World Health Organisation (WHO). He eradicated malaria from the Northern Territory, Cape York and the Torres Strait Islands in 1962 - the area was officially declared to be malaria free by WHO in 1981. Black became a consultant for WHO and devoted the rest of his working life to preventing and eradicating malaria. He is the only Australian to have been awarded the Darling Foundation Medal and Prize by WHO for his work in the control of malaria."

With Reed's support, he began to produce his signature series of images, incorporating schoolgirls with flowers and _Alice in Wonderland_ figures and motifs. He was a signatory to the _Antipodean Manifesto_ (loosely, a defence of figuration against abstraction) in the early 1950s. After he won the Helena Rubinstein Scholarship in 1960, his work was shown in the important Whitechapel and Tate exhibitions in London in 1961â€“1962. Exhibiting prolifically throughout his career, over the 1970s he produced softer images of cats and gardens. In the early 1990s, a period during which he revisited themes of his early work, a Blackman retrospective exhibition toured nationally."

                            "When I first sort of, ten years I painted, I painted in a very emotional way, that is, that I worked from 9 oâ€™clock in the morning till 11 oâ€™clock at night painting like crazy. But it was not really a sort of disciplined thing, it wasnâ€™t really a thought-out thing. It was a thing where it was chasing a substance, it was kind of style chasing a substance. Once the substance was realised in some sort of sense, then the operative thing was to make it function properly, make it function fully. Itâ€™s like, sort of, driving a little baby Austin, finally you become a mature enough driver to be able to run an E-type Jag or a very complex piece of machinery. You have the emotional equipment realised, but it is then to make it a public fact, it is then to make it kind of articulate, a real articulate message in plastic terms, that is, it must be, the feeling must be couched properly in paint, the image must be embedded properly in the paint, must be trapped, as Francis Bacon says very well, in the paint.\\n\\nWell, now I work not so haphazardly, get up very early in the morning, go to the studio, clean up all the brushes, tidy up the room, sweep the floor and start working in a very detached sort of way, and work through disinterest to interest, or work, labour, very long hours on making a painting function within itself in a fairly detached sort of way. But this only could have been done by this kind of organic growth of the personality, it couldnâ€™t have been done in the artificial sense, you canâ€™t outside impose thoughts, they have to grow.",

She became a member of Brisbane's literary circle, joining the writers' group _Barjai_, which included Judith Wright and Thea Astley. In 1950 she was diagnosed with optic atrophy, and was declared blind by the age of 22. 'It seemed to me I was given a life sentence for a crime I had not committed,' she wrote in her 1997 biography _Glass after Glass_. Moving to Sydney to study, she met artist Charles Blackman. After they married in 1952, they moved to Melbourne, where they associated with the avant-garde group centred around the Melbourne Contemporary Art Society: Arthur Boyd, Fred Williams, Joy Hester, John and Sunday Reed, Clifton Pugh, John Perceval, Len French and Mirka Mora among others. In the 1960s the Blackmans were part of the Australian Push active in London. Long-term muse to her husband (they divorced in 1978), she appeared in many of his paintings including his 1956 series _Alice in Wonderland_, and modelled for their artist friends. Blackman also worked as a magazine columnist and a radio-producer for Radio for the Print Handicapped, and helped form the National Federation of Blind Citizens. She interviewed hundreds of people for the National Library of Australia's oral history program. Blackman published _Portrait of a Friendship_, which drew on her correspondence with Judith Wright, in 2007. A documentary about her life, _Seeing from Within_, was released in 2017."

                            "It was in many ways a very unlikely marriage, for a person near-blind or going blind to marry someone whose whole world was a visual world and who was so creative in that visual world. But somehow what his creations came out of â€“ a sort of a living or understanding of poetry â€“ was something that always bound us and still binds us together. But at that time when I recognised Charles as potentially a very great painter and a great creator, I relinquished my strong intentions of being a writer and although I went on writing diaries and sometimes poems and more and more I became a very prolific letter-writer as I gathered more and more interesting people as friends and we became more and more separated by distance, my writing changed course, as in fact my life had changed course to become devoted to Charlesâ€™ optimal putting forward of himself as a painter.\\n\\nYou know, when we married I said, â€˜Well if youâ€™re going to be a painter, youâ€™re going to paint, youâ€™re not going to go out and get a job doing something or another,â€™ so he stayed home and painted. And by this time my eyesight had failed almost altogether and I was on a blind pension, so we had that as a basis to live on. And the only thing I could really do was to work as an artistâ€™s model, as a nude model, which in fact I quite enjoyed because I was picking up a lot of information about painting. Itâ€™s quite an elegant job in its way, being a model, because one can decide oneâ€™s own poses and itâ€™s a very private occupation. One can have oneâ€™s own thoughts and one has the satisfaction of knowing oneâ€™s doing a job well.",

                            "Harold Blair AO (1924â€“1976), singer and Indigenous advocate, spent his youth on the Purga Mission, and began singing in local concerts on the canefields in the Childers area. When Marjorie Lawrence visited Brisbane on a concert tour in 1944, she urged him to take his singing further. In March 1945 he sang on _Australia's Amateur Hour_ and gained a record number of votes. Rejected elsewhere, he was finally accepted by the Melbourne (Melba) Conservatorium of Music, gaining his diploma in 1949. Having scraped up the means to study in New York, he performed in a benefit concert in the New York Town Hall in early 1951; some months later, he appeared as a guest artist for the ABCâ€™s Jubilee Tour of Australia. Returning to Melbourne, he worked in a department store and in 1956 began to teach part-time at the conservatorium. After spending 1959 in Europe, he became the proprietor of a service station and later of a milk bar. A member of the Aboriginesâ€™ Welfare Board in Victoria in the late 1950s, Blair was also involved in the Aborigines Advancement League, the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the Commonwealth Aboriginal Arts Board and initiated the successful Aboriginal Childrenâ€™s Holiday Project. In 1964 he stood to no avail as Labor candidate for Mentone; three years later he began work as a school music teacher. In 1973, three years before he died, he won praise for his performance in the opera _Dalgerie_, at the Sydney Opera House."

                            "William Bligh (1754-1817), naval officer, was born in Plymouth and first went to sea at around the age of eight. Aged sixteen, he joined the Royal Navy, and six years later he was appointed to accompany Cook's third voyage as Master of HMS Resolution. Bligh's main task was to make charts, and on the voyage he honed the navigational skills that would become - along with volatility and authoritarianism - his best known characteristics. Subsequently promoted to Lieutenant, he served in the West Indies before being appointed commander of the Bounty. The Bounty left England in December 1787 to collect breadfruit from Tahiti, which it reached 11 months later. Soon after leaving the island, in April 1789, the Bounty's crew, led by the second-in-command, Fletcher Christian, mutinied. Bligh and eighteen supporters were set adrift in an open boat with minimal provisions and no maps, but he successfully navigated over 3000 miles to Timor, during the voyage charting part of the coast of Australia. On his return Bligh was honourably acquitted by a court martial, while three of the ten mutineers brought to trial in England were hanged. For Bligh, the upshot of the mutiny was a reputation for tyranny, which would continue to disrupt his career. Through Sir Joseph Banks, Bligh was appointed Governor of NSW, coming to the post in August 1806 with a brief to curb the trade in rum and the influence of powerful, wealthy colonists. Again, despite his general integrity, Bligh's abrasive manner and rigid adherence to orders created conflict over issues such as land, town planning and convict labour. These led ultimately to Australia's first and only military coup, the 'Rum Rebellion' of January 1808, wherein Bligh was deposed by the NSW Corps. He was held under house arrest in Sydney for more than a year; his replacement, Lachlan Macquarie, did not arrive to take up the Governorship until December 1809. After returning to England, Bligh was eventually promoted to Vice Admiral. He died in London, survived by his six daughters."

                            "I am now unhappily to relate one of the most atrocious acts of piracy ever committed. Just before sunrise, Mr Christian and the master at arms and several officers came into my cabin while I was fast asleep, and seizing me, tied my hands with a cord and threatened instant death if I made the least noise. I called sufficiently loud to alarm the officers, who found themselves equally secured by sentinels at their doors. There were now three men at my cabin door and four inside. Mr Christian had a cutlass and the others were armed with muskets and bayonets.\\n\\nI was carried on deck in my shirt, in torture with a severe bandage around my wrists, where I found no man to rescue me. I asked the reason for such a violent act, but I was threatened to be put to death if I said a word. The boatswain was ordered to hoist the small cutter out, with a threat if he did not do it instantly to take care of himself. But on a representation that this boat was very leaky, he was directed to hoist the launch out. Mr Hayward and Hallet, midshipmen, and Mr Samuels, clerk, were now ordered into the boat. I assumed my authority and demanded the cause of such an order, endeavouring to bring someone to a sense of his duty, but it was to no effect. â€˜Hold your tongue sir, or you are dead this instantâ€™, was constantly repeated to me.\\n\\nI continued to endeavour to change the tide of affairs, when Christian changed the cutlass he had in his hand for a bayonet and holding me with a strong grip by the cord that tied my hands, he continued to threaten me with instant death if I did not be quiet. The villains around me had their pieces cocked and bayonets fixed and particular people were now called on to go into the boat and were hurried over the side. With those people, I concluded of course, that I was to be set adrift. I therefore in making another effort to bring about a change, expressed myself loudly in such a manner as to be saluted with â€˜blow his brains outâ€™.",

                            "Peter Booth (b. 1940) grew up in the English steel mill town of Sheffield, bike-riding on the nearby moors. He left school at 15 and from 1956 to 1957, attended evening drawing classes at Sheffield College of Art while working as a copyboy for a local newspaper. Drawing constantly, he began keeping a dream diary in 1973. In 1957, the Booth family immigrated to Australia, settling in the then semi-rural town of Altona. He attended the National Gallery School in 1962 finding an inspiring mentor in John Brack. Graduating in 1965, Booth went on to teach painting at Prahran Technical College from 1966-69, as well as teaching drawing part-time at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1967. Booth gained widespread recognition through the inclusion of his large architectural â€˜blockâ€™ paintings in The Field in 1968. From 1969-75, during which time he began keeping a dream diary, Booth worked in the Prints and Drawing section of the National Gallery of Victoria, becoming deeply impressed with the work of William Blake and Goya as well as the authors Tolstoy, Singer, Lessing, and Marquez. He followed the â€˜Blockâ€™ series with the â€˜Doorwayâ€™ series (1970-74). From the mid-1970s his work changed to vivid abstractions drawn from his dreams, featuring monstrous hybrid figures, circular motifs, and warped space. During the 1980s he continued to depict mutants, as well as solitary men who also appeared amongst crowds in other works. Around this time, he began his continuing incorporation of flakes of snow drifting over his figures and desolate landscapes. Booth is represented in all major Australian galleries; the Ian Potter Centre held an exhibition of 230 of his paintings in 2003."

                            "Polly Borland, born in Melbourne in 1959, began her photographic career in Australia before moving to London in 1989. Since then she has established an international reputation as a leading portrait and reportage photographer. She has also shot movie stills and 'specials' for the films _Dogs in Space_, directed by Richard Lowenstein, and _Ghosts of the Civil Dead_ and _To Have and to Hold_, both directed by her husband John Hillcoat. Her first book, _The Babies_, a photographic study of infantilists (adults who derive sexual pleasure from acting or being treated as babies), was released in December 2000. Joint winner of the 1994 John Kobal Photography Portrait Award, Borland's work has featured in exhibitions in Australia and the United Kingdom including the 1999 Meltdown Festival in London, the British National Portrait Gallery's display _Artists of the 1990s_ and _Glossy: Faces Magazines Now_ at the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra.  _Polly Borland: Australians_, an exhibition which is a collaborative project between the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra, and the National Portrait Gallery, London to celebrate the Centenary of Federation was shown in London and Australia in 2000-2001. Borland says that \"I have a fascination with people - I love meeting them and photographing them. It's a passion. I think of my camera like a microscope, regarding my sitters closely. On a good day it is more like a x-ray machine being able to penetrate below the surface. At its best portrait photography is psychologically revealing.\""

                            "There were all sorts of photos of Germaine through the years of her naked and, you know, in controversial poses. And anyway, I got there, and I think in the back of my mind I thought itâ€™d be great to get her naked, but I thought thereâ€™s no way sheâ€™s going to do that. And sheâ€™s still beautiful, very Amazonian kind of woman. Every time I went somewhere to photograph, I tried to look for the most simple area in the house. Nothing really appealed to me and then I went into her bedroom, and she said â€˜Oh well of course you can photograph me in hereâ€™ and she said to Jenny my assistant â€˜Well of course Iâ€™d never be clothed in my bedroom; Iâ€™d have my clothes off.â€™ And so Jenny came through to me and she went â€˜She wants to take her clothes offâ€™ and Iâ€™m like, wow, Iâ€™ve thought Iâ€™ve hit the jackpot, this is amazing. It was her idea, not mine, she took her clothes off, sheâ€™s happy to do it, totally consensual.\\n\\nThe Sun or one of the tabloid English press got a hold of the picture and published it. And she said â€˜Well I want to give it to The Sun for the page three girl section which was the notorious boobs, naked breasts. But at that point we were suing the other tabloid newspaper for using the photo without my permission. So we couldnâ€™t then let The Sun use it even though that would have been really funny. So we said â€˜Look, no, we canâ€™t do it.â€™ And she was the one from wanting us to give it to The Sun or sell it to The Sun or whatever. So I think she got a little bit annoyed that we said no we canâ€™t do that because itâ€™s going to take away from the court case. Anyway, and then the next time I read anything that she said about the photo sheâ€™s completely slamming the photo. So like, you know, itâ€™s awful, itâ€™s this, itâ€™s that, you know, she manipulated me. And I just thought, â€˜Oh I canâ€™t be bothered with this.â€™",

                            "Stella Bowen, painter and writer, grew up in Adelaide, where she studied with Margaret Preston. She left Adelaide in 1914 to live in England and France for the rest of her life. Over the course of a nine-year relationship with the English writer Ford Madox Ford she painted many portraits of their friends, including Aldous Huxley, Edith Sitwell, Gertrude Stein and TS Eliot. She achieved some success in the US, but she is best-known in Australia for the works of art she completed as an official war artist in Britain in World War II, particularly those depicting the actions of the Bomber Command and the return of prisoners of war from Germany. Many of these paintings are in the collection of the Australian War Memorial, which mounted a major retrospective exhibition of Bowen's works in 2002. Bowen's autobiography, _Drawn From Life_, was published in 1941, and extensive public interest in the artist was sparked in 1999 with the publication of Drusilla Modjeska's _Stravinsky's Lunch_, a ruminative parallel biography of Bowen and Grace Cossington Smith."

                            "Arthur Boyd AC OBE (1920â€“1999), painter, potter and printmaker, was one of Australiaâ€™s greatest artists. Born in Murrumbeena, an outer suburb of Melbourne, Boydâ€™s mother and father, Doris and Merric, were artists, as were his paternal grandparents, Arthur Merric and Emma Minnie Boyd. He began making paintings as a boy and briefly attended night classes at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, developing a vigorous and expressive style. During the Second World War he was conscripted into the Cartographic Unit of the Australian Army. Although he did not see active service, the war inspired paintings depicting a grotesque and unbalanced world. During a trip to Central Australia in the 1950s he was shocked by the living conditions of Aboriginal people in Alice Springs, which resulted in his controversial series Love, Marriage and Death of a Half-caste. In the 1960s, living mainly in England, Boyd embarked on ambitious cycles of paintings based on biblical and mythological themes in Australian bush settings, and designed theatre costumes and sets. Returning to Australia in the early 1970s, he bought a property on the Shoalhaven River on the south coast of New South Wales, Bundanon, where he continued to paint landscapes. Also known for his philanthropy, Boyd made an immense gift of his own work to the National Gallery of Australia in 1975; in 1993 he generously gifted Bundanon to the Australian people."

But, I mean, you donâ€™t ever come out with anything fresh or marvellous, it always seems ghastly when it goes up on the wall, and maybe it is.\\n\\nI hope itâ€™s becoming less taped, or typed. Not meant to be a pun, but anyway, I think thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d prefer to be happening, that itâ€™s becoming just as much mine, if I can make it that way, but much less typed in the sense that it would be, well, â€˜thatâ€™s Australianâ€™, or â€˜that comes from Melbourne, that comes from Ballarat, thatâ€™s where â€¦â€™. Iâ€™d like it to be much more a universal sort of thing. I donâ€™t mean necessarily the painting to look as if it could be done anywhere, but just that it would be much more like good painting rather than like something that comes from somewhere.",

She lectured in music at the University of Sussex before returning to Australia to take up an Australia Council grant that enabled her to work full-time as a composer between 1977 and 1981. She had already written one of her best-known works, As I crossed a bridge of dreams, which is part of the standard contemporary choir repertoire, but during this period she wrote various chamber works, the oratorio The Death of Captain Cook, and the choral symphony Coal River. In 1981 she became the founding head of Hong Kong University's Department of Music, and in 1990 Professor and Head of the Department of Music at the University of Sydney. While working in Hong Kong she wrote the children's opera The Little Mermaid for the Australian Opera. Boyd gained wider fame as a public advocate of increased funding for Australian universities as the focus of the Bob Connolly/Robin Anderson documentary Facing the Music in 2001."

                            "One of my earliest musical experiences is the memory of my aunt playing the piano and singing in the adjacent lounge room to our â€“ well what was still called then the nursery, on this country property. Also, I used to listen to the radio a lot, in fact one of my favourite games was playing with the frequencies of radios and seeing what kinds of statics and sounds I could pick up, and of course, short wave was just fantastic and I was able to often, during the evening, pick up neighbouring Asian stations and so on, and this music really excited me as a child. Whenever I heard music I was always drawn to it. I had to go and listen to it. At about the age of six, my sister sent me a recorder and a teach-yourself manual so, of course, I taught myself to play the recorder in a very short time. This again was something which was very important to me as a means of expression and I, in fact, started writing quite â€“ well, bizarre scores, really the notation of which meant nothing to anybody except myself, but I used to derive a great deal of enjoyment from playing these weird symbols that Iâ€™d managed to put down onto paper.\\n\\nPerhaps my attraction to the sound of shortwave and the static and so on that was created by the radio is a result of my trips by air, the first one of which I undertook as a small child at the age of two. The sounds of the engines of the plane even fascinated me, and the variation in the contrasting timbres and dynamics of what happened when you were actually up in the air. I think probably my fascination with sound of all kinds was a result of living in a silent or a comparatively silent environment in the country, and so therefore these sounds of the city, of machines, of planes, in my rare contacts with them, are all the more meaningful to me.",

After war service he resumed his studies, and in 1949 secured a job in the NGVâ€™s Print Room, where he worked until 1951, leaving to take up the position of art master at Melbourne Grammar School. His paintings succeeded immediately; his first exhibited work, _Barberâ€™s Shop_, was purchased for the NGV in 1953 as was _Collins Street, 5p.m._ three years later. In 1962 he became Head of the National Gallery Art School. Six years later, finally confident that he could make a living as a full-time artist, he resigned. He painted shopfronts, school yards, gardens and housing estates, nudes, office workers, ballroom dancers, jockeys, brides, drinkers, commissioned portraits and portraits of friends and family. In recent years _The Bar_ 1954 and _The Old Time_ 1969 have set new auction records for the sale of Australian paintings."

                            "I always paint without a model, because being a conceptual painter, being a painter whose interest is in ideas, the model gets in the road, prevents me from meditating about it in such a way that Iâ€™m absorbed by hosts of visual details instead of by the idea. What Iâ€™m interested in in painting is people, of course, principally, how they live, how they behave, how they get the faces they deserve, how they can bear to put up with a life which seems so curiously tragic.\\n\\nOf course I know that to be interested in peopleâ€™s behaviour for a painter is most impure. Itâ€™s called literary, and in our day nothing could be a greater sin than to be a literary painter; but now Iâ€™m old enough to feel that itâ€™s a waste of time to apologise for not painting in some other way, and the fact is that Iâ€™m still always fascinated by people and their behaviour. And yet at the same time, itâ€™s not enough to just paint pictures of ideas; at the same time we must put it into a visual form which is as complete as any abstract visual form. And here, thereâ€™s always a conflict between the demands of the idea and the demands of the form.\\n\\nAnd in any case, Iâ€™m always dubious about the remarks painters make about their own work, because what we so often say is rather what we would like to have done than what weâ€™ve really done.",

                            "Christopher Brennan (1870â€“1932), poet, was born to Irish parents in Sydney. A brilliant schoolboy, destined early for the priesthood, he gained a scholarship from Cardinal Moran and went to Riverview; there, he abandoned his vocation. As a language and classics student at Sydney University he edited Hermes, fell in love with Victorian poetry, graduated with a First and a University Medal, and lost his religious faith. After a short stint teaching at St Patrickâ€™s, Goulburn, he won a travelling scholarship to the University of Berlin, where he became convinced of the power of poetry to reclaim an ideal version of humanity. Returning to Sydney in 1894, he began cataloguing in the New South Wales Public Library, where he was to rise to second assistant librarian by 1907. Late in 1909 he was appointed an assistant lecturer in French and German at the University of Sydney. His poetic output â€“ complex and symbolic, always more European than Australian in sensibility - for the most part declined after 1902; his biographer Axel Clark suggests that the moderately successful pro-war poems he wrote during the First World War sprang from his hostility toward his German wife and mother-in-law. After he divorced, he embarked on an affair with a younger woman; her accidental death gave rise to some of his finest poems, but his life was thrown into irrecoverable chaos. Gaining odds and ends of teaching, and supported by friends and admirers, he retrieved his Catholic faith before he died. Clark writes that â€˜although he abhorred Henry Lawson as a poet and a man, the progress of their lives was hauntingly similar: promise, achievement, degeneration, disgrace, posthumous legend.â€™"

Born in Adelaide, he studied painting and drawing at the South Australian School of Art and Design and started taking photographs while completing his degree. He then moved to Sydney and from the mid-1990s began increasingly to specialise in portraiture. With clients including film studios and record companies, his carefully composed and thought-provoking photographs have appeared in a range of Australian and international publications including _Vogue_, _Marie Claire_, _Elle_, _Who_, _Rolling Stone_, _Inside Sport_ and _GQ_. In 2005, the National Portrait Gallery presented the exhibition _Peter Brew-Bevan: Portraits_ and he was one of eight photographers included in the Portrait Galleryâ€™s 2014 exhibition _Promo: Portraits from Prime Time_. His photographic book _Shoot: Studio Sessions_ (2007), a selection of his images of actors and other celebrities, won six industry awards for concept and design. In 2019, Brew-Bevan founded the 2020 MEN-Tality Project in partnership with Beyond Blue, which focuses on destigmatising men's mental health through a series of portraits of prominent Australian men with experience of depression and anxiety. The Portrait Gallery's collection includes 21 of his photographs."

                            "Joseph Brown AO OBE (1918â€“2009), art collector, art dealer and philanthropist, arrived in Australia with his father and siblings from Poland in 1933; his mother had passed away shortly before their departure. The family settled in Carlton. In 1934, he started classes in painting and sculpture with Napier Waller at the Working Men's College (now RMIT) and later won a scholarship to the Brunswick Technical College. The Depression put an end to his studies, and in 1940 he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Force. At the conclusion of his military service, in 1945, he married and established a fashion design business, but continued to paint and sculpt and occasionally exhibit his work. By 1967, he was in a position to open the Joseph Brown Gallery in Collins Street, Melbourne, at which he frequently showed mixed exhibitions of contemporary Australian art. Over time, Brown built up one of the finest private art collections in Australia, and made such substantial contributions to Australian art history that he was awarded three honorary doctorates. His gallery often exhibited the work of overlooked or forgotten artists, and his work had the effect of reinstating colonial art, portraiture and other 'unfashionable' genres to critical and scholarly attention. During the same period, Brown donated in excess of 400 works of art to public collections, including a gift of over 150 works with a total value of $35 million to the National Gallery of Victoria in 2004."

                            "Lina Bryans OAM (1909-2000), artist, was born into a prosperous Melbourne family and grew up moving freely between Toorak and Europe. She was married for five years in the early 1930s, giving birth to a son; separated, she moved to South Yarra, where, encouraged by Jock Frater and Iain McKinnon, she developed an interest in art. By 1938 her work was included in the Herald Exhibition of Outstanding Pictures. Apart from a few lessons she took with George Bell in 1948, and a few months at the Grande ChaumiÃ¨re in Paris in 1953, she had no formal art training. She never became allied with the major Melbourne art cliques, the George Bell circle or the Heide crowd. Instead, for much of the 1940s, her home, Darebin Bridge House, became a meeting place for the Meanjin literary set and artists including Ian Fairweather, who often camped at her so-called â€˜Pink Hotelâ€™. In 1948 she moved to Harkaway, near Berwick. Between 1937 and 1974 she painted more than 70 portraits of her artistic and literary contemporaries; for much of this time, she was a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, but she left the group in 1966 (only to rejoin in 1991). The first of her many portraits, of fellow artist Ambrose Hallen, was donated to the National Portrait Gallery by Sir James and Lady Cruthers in 2001; her later portrait of Alan Marshall had been one of the first acquired for the collection, three years earlier. One of her best-known portraits, representing Jean Campbell but titled _The babe is wise_, is in the collection of the NGV along with fourteen of her other works. Since the early 1980s Bryans has attracted a good deal of critical interest and her works have been exhibited often. Gillian Forwoodâ€™s _Lina Bryans: Rare Modern 1909-2000_ was published in 2003."

                            "Quentin Bryce AD CVO (b. 1942), academic, lawyer and community and human rights advocate, was the first woman to be appointed governor-general of Australia. Born in Brisbane, she spent her early childhood in Ilfracombe in central western Queensland. She finished school in Brisbane before completing degrees in arts and law at the University of Queensland, where in 1968 she became the first female member of the law faculty. By the time she retired from teaching in 1983, she was increasingly involved in human rights and advocacy work. Over the next decade she was director of the Queensland Womenâ€™s Information Service, director of Queenslandâ€™s Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner. Having spent three years as chair of the National Childcare Accreditation Council, in 1997 she became principal and chief executive officer of the Women's College within the University of Sydney. Six years later she became governor of Queensland, continuing her work with women, families and young people while extending her influence across rural, regional, aged, indigenous, migrant, and disability sectors. In 2008 she was appointed Australiaâ€™s 25th governor-general. Her term concluded in March 2014, after which she chaired Queenslandâ€™s special taskforce on domestic and family violence."

                            "When I was about 16 I was pretty clear about what I wanted to do; it was a pretty bold, enormous ambition to change the world. I saw law as a way to go about it. There certainly were some knockbacks that I had. I mostly kept them to myself because, you know, we were brought up to be pretty stoic in a way, my generation. Little girls were to be seen and not heard, so you sort of took those knockbacks on the chin a bit. But amongst them were people whom I remember with respect and a deep affection, who were great supporters, who encouraged me and anything Iâ€™ve ever achieved in my life has been with wonderful support and encouragement.\\n\\nBut I have to say, Iâ€™m also very conscious of women who donâ€™t have the supports and the opportunities and the encouragement that they need. And very often they are women living on the edges of our society in many ways. My mantra for a long time has been â€˜You can have it all but not all at the same timeâ€™. I think thatâ€™s quite an important thing for women to remember when they are taking on all the responsibilities that they have and the hard road to fulfilling their ambitions, their hopes and their dreams.\\n\\nSo, I am very keen to do anything I can to support and encourage them quietly in the background. Thatâ€™s what I like to focus on now, is this passing on to younger women the sort of help and guidance and encouragement particularly that was given to me by older women.",

As a student under Bernard Hall and WB McInnes at the NGV school from 1918 to 1924, he won many prizes. From this period on, his landscapes and flower pieces sold well, particularly in Victoria and South Australia, and from the time of his first Sydney exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries in 1927 he was commissioned as a portraitist. With a remarkable 72 portraits hung in the Archibald Prize between 1924 and 1966, he won the Prize in 1932 with a portrait of Sir William Irvine. At the end of the second world war he was sent as an official war artist to document the Japanese surrender; he missed the ceremony, but still completed 51 works for the War Memorial. Over the course of his career he made many articulate attacks on modern art."

                            "Being predominantly, I suppose, we could say over the years, a landscape painter, battling with the changes that occur from hour to hour outdoors, trying to match the subtle changing scene, I did actually, I think, try to evolve a working method which would enable me to match, or catch, in shape, tone and colour fleeting effects of nature which would not recur again. Itâ€™s whatâ€™s known as direct painting. I think one of my exhibition managers said: â€˜Youâ€™re a first-class direct painter, Buckmasterâ€™. And I hardly knew what he meant in those days, but I can see it clearly now. Thereâ€™s the subject, you put up your canvas, you assess the picture, nature provides you with the inspiration, you, in your mindâ€™s eye, you eliminate the unessentials, you assess and you conceive your picture from what is before you.\\n\\nAnd so, shape, tone and colour: see it, conceive it, think of it, realise it, see your picture in your mindâ€™s eye, then pick up your loaded palette and your brushes and cover the canvas with the masses, the main masses in tone and subtle colour first; the details follow automatically as the pieces fit into a jigsaw puzzle. That has been one angle of my working method on landscape.\\n\\nItâ€™s quite a totally different technique on portraiture or figure composition. Itâ€™s a different thing altogether. Itâ€™s too involved to go into now.",

                            "The Hon. Linda Jean Burney MP (b. 1957), a Wiradjuri woman, is the first First Nations person elected to the New South Wales parliament, and the first First Nations woman to serve in the federal House of Representatives. Born in Whitton in south-west New South Wales, she attained a Diploma of Education from Mitchell College of Advanced Education (now part of Charles Sturt University) in the 1970s, thereby becoming the institution's first Aboriginal graduate. She began her teaching career in western Sydney in 1979 and later worked as an education policy advisor before being appointed Director General of the NSW Department of Aboriginal Affairs. She was elected Member of the Legislative Assembly for Canterbury (NSW) in 2003, subsequently becoming Deputy Leader of the Opposition and holding shadow portfolios including Family and Community Services, Aboriginal Affairs, and Sport and Recreation. In 2016 she resigned from her state post to contest the federal seat of Barton. She was sung into parliament for her inaugural speech, in which she stated that 'recognition of first people in our nation's constitution is the next step â€¦ towards a country that can look itself in the eye knowing that we have come of age'. As a member of the shadow ministry between 2016 and 2022 she held the portfolios of Human Services, Families and Social Services, Indigenous Australians, and Preventing Family Violence. She made history again on being sworn in as Minister for Indigenous Australians in June 2022, becoming the first First Nations woman to serve in federal cabinet. Burney has been a member of the National Social Justice Task Force of ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and has represented Aboriginal Australians at the United Nations. She holds an honorary doctorate from Charles Sturt University and has served on a number of boards including those of SBS, the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board and the NSW Board of Studies."

                            "Burnum Burnum (1936â€“1997), Woiworung/Yorta Yorta activist, actor and author, was born at Wallaga Lake and taken from his family at three months old after his mother died. As Harry Penrith, he spent his childhood at Bomaderry childrenâ€™s home and the notorious Kinchela Boysâ€™ home. A talented sportsman, he played first grade rugby union for Parramatta, as well as rugby league and cricket. He then joined the Australian public service, working for the Department of Agriculture for thirteen years. In the mid-1960s he became involved with Indigenous rights activism, lobbying for the 1967 Referendum. While studying law at the University of Tasmania he led a successful campaign to reclaim the remains of Truganini from the Tasmanian Museum in Hobart. He was part of the establishment of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra in 1972 and the following year worked as a manager of Aboriginal Hostels. He received a Churchill Fellowship to travel overseas to study accommodation techniques in overseas hostels for Indigenous cultures. In 1976 he changed his name to Burnum Burnum (great warrior) to honour his great-grandfather, artist Tommy McRae, and to attest to his Aboriginality. Burnum ran for the Australian Senate as an independent in 1983 and 1984. During the bicentenary celebrations in 1988 he laid claim to England at the white cliffs of Dover, erecting the Aboriginal flag. That year he wrote Burnum Burnum's _Aboriginal Australia: A Traveller's Guide_. A biography by JM Norst, _A Warrior for Peace: Burnum Burnum_, was published in 1999."

                            "Deidre But-Husaim (b. 1959), based in Adelaide, South Australia, undertook her formative art study at the Adelaide Central School of Art, where she has since taught painting. After some yearsâ€™ travel, exhibiting and working independently, she completed her degree through Adelaide Centre for the Arts in 2006. Since then, in a number of portraits of both notable Australian public figures and â€˜unknownâ€™ subjects, she has sought to explore the dichotomy of the public and private self. Her work has featured in solo and group exhibitions in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney, and has been selected for exhibition in the Doug Moran Portrait Prize, the Portia Geach Memorial Award, the Sulman Prize, the Waterhouse National Science Art Prize, the Archibald Prize, the Sunshine Coast Art Prize, the Albany Art Prize, the Arthur Guy Memorial Painting Prize and the Geelong Contemporary Art Prize. In 2014 she became the first artist chosen to undertake a Guildhouse Collections Project at the Art Gallery of South Australia, producing a quiet series of paintings of people engaging with artworks in the Gallery. She won the Kennedy Arts Foundation Award for her work _The Ineffable_ in 2016. But-Husaimâ€™s work is held in public and private collections throughout Australia."

                            "Dame Nancy Buttfield DBE (1912â€“2005) was the first South Australian woman member of Federal Parliament. The daughter of car industry pioneer Sir Edward Holden, she was educated at Adelaide's Woodlands Church of England Girls' Grammar School and at a finishing school in Paris. Later, she studied psychology, music and economics part-time at Adelaide University. She married businessman Frank Buttfield in 1936. Her interest in politics was encouraged by her father, a state parliamentarian, and family friend Robert Menzies, from whom she sought advice about a political career. In 1954, she was endorsed as the Liberal Party candidate for Adelaide, unsuccessfully contesting the seat in the federal election that year. When a senate seat fell vacant in 1955, she was elected to parliament as a Liberal senator for South Australia, serving from 1955 to 1965 and again from 1968 to 1974. Though her support for women's rights put her at odds with some of her male colleagues, she lobbied on issues such as equal pay for women and for the right of married women to work in the Public Service. Despite her staunch anti-communist views, she was the first female senator to visit the USSR, and she toured China alone in 1962. In 1972, she was made a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. After she retired from politics in 1974 she and her husband developed the Youth Venture Club. She also served on many boards and made philanthropic contributions to youth and the arts."

                            "Robert Campbell Junior, urban Aboriginal artist, was a Ngaku/Dhunghutti man who grew up in Kempsey, New South Wales. Although in the 1950s the Indigenous people of the region were actively discouraged from pursuing any of their traditions, Campbell's father was a boomerang maker and Campbell observed him at his craft, shaping wood and inscribing designs. Educated at the Burnt Bridge Mission School, from the age of fourteen Campbell worked in a series of menial jobs in Kempsey and Sydney. When he returned to his birthplace, he started to paint in earnest, depicting, as he said, his personal response to his environment, 'both past and present, the people, the landscape, and my own relationship with both . . . Aboriginal culture naturally becomes a part of my work as a reflection of my heritage and ancestry, but my message is to all people.' In the 1980s, shows in Sydney and Melbourne at the Roslyn Oxley and Christine Abrahams galleries brought him critical recognition. In 1987 he was the artist in residence at the Tin Sheds at the University of Sydney and he was commissioned to create a poster for the Bicentennial Authority. In the late 1980s he travelled to Ramingining in the Northern Territory; he found the experience of the traditional community totally new, and to a certain extent the visit influenced his subsequent work. His portraits _My Brother Mac Silva_ 1989 and _Sammy Alfie Drew: Local Macleay Aboriginal Sporting Identity_ 1990 were hung in the Archibald; in 1990 he had a solo show at the Rebecca Hossack Gallery in London. Campbell's picture _The Provider of the Tucker_ 1987 was hung in the National Portrait Gallery exhibition _A Face in the Crowd_ in 1997; his _Aboriginal Embassy_ 1986 was shown in _Open Air: Portraits and Landscapes_ in 2008."

He completed his BA in Fine Arts at RMIT Melbourne in 1982 and a graduate diploma in painting at the Victorian College of the Arts in 1985. Since then he has held more than twenty solo exhibitions and participated in many group shows. Cars, suburbs, rock music and surfing are favourite themes of Campbell's; since the 1990s he has produced many artworks incorporating the word 'yeah'. His painting So you wanna be a rock'n'roll star (1990), now in the National Gallery of Victoria, was a key image of the National Portrait Gallery's exhibition of the same name in 2002. Campbell's portrait of singer Paul Kelly was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in 2004."

                            "Judy Cassab AO CBE (1920â€“2015) was one of Australia's best-loved, most successful and prolific portrait painters. Born in Vienna, she studied art in Prague and at the Budapest Academy before adopting false papers and 'going underground' to escape the persecution of Hungarian Jews. After the war, she and her husband reunited and emigrated to Australia in 1951. Within months of arriving in Sydney, she was commissioned by Sir Charles Lloyd Jones to paint a portrait of his wife, becoming an Archibald finalist for the first time the following year. In 1953, she held her first Australian solo exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The winner of the _Australian Women's Weekly_ Portrait Prize in 1955 and 1956, by the mid-1960s she was sought-after as a portraitist, completing commissions for high-profile clients such as Princess Alexandra and Queen Sirikit of Thailand. In 1960, she won the Archibald Prize for her portrait of her friend, Stanislaus Rapotec; in 1967, she won it again with her painting of artist Margo Lewers. In all, Cassab had 41 paintings exhibited in the Archibald Prize. \\n\\nThrough her many other portraits â€“ both formal commissions and portrayals of family and friends â€“ she created a distinct record of Australian society from the 1950s onwards. Cassab also found inspiration for a more abstract style of painting in the landscape of the Northern Territory, to which she repeatedly returned, and won several awards for her landscape works in the Wynne Prize. Her many awards include an honorary doctorate from the University of Sydney and the 1996 Nita B Kibble Literary Award for her published diaries."

                            "It was always my aim to try and paint a portrait which would fit into the age we are living in. Of course, when I was very young I just painted academic portraits. Then, as I developed in my other paintings, the portrait developed with it. I still think that every portrait I do is a failure because it didnâ€™t reach what I wanted to do with it. I think Iâ€™m best known as a portrait painter because these are the things that get most publicity, but I never wanted to be a portrait painter and I donâ€™t consider myself one.\\n\\nLately, I tried to combine abstract with the portrait but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good marriage. I think the best I can do is to paint my abstract pictures and develop them and develop myself, and let the portraits flow freely, because I donâ€™t believe that something which was art all through the centuries stops being art just because it lost its credit by the photographic portraits, the anonymous portraits, from which we have 300 in each country in the world; and although I know that it is a clash, I think, between my other paintings and the portraits, I canâ€™t give up. Itâ€™s something that interests me, and that I might solve or might not. Anyway, it doesnâ€™t matter if I solve it when Iâ€™m 70.",

                            "Nick Cave AO (b. 1957), singer, songwriter and author, was born in Warracknabeal, Victoria, and educated at Caulfield Grammar School, where he formed his first band, The Boys Next Door. In 1980 the band changed its name to The Birthday Party and moved to London, where it significantly influenced other punk bands. With several talented recruits, members of the Birthday Party formed The Bad Seeds, whose first album was released in 1984. Cave has participated in a number of fruitful musical collaborations and side projects including the band Grinderman. He has also been involved in several films as an actor, screenwriter and composer, including the arthouse sensation _Wings of Desire_ (1987) and _Ghosts ... of the Civil Dead_ (1988). He scripted the grim Australian drama _The Proposition_ (2006); appeared in _I'm Your Man_ (2005â€“2006); and co-wrote and starred in a wry documentary drama about himself, _20,000 Days on Earth_ (2014). A long-term resident of the UK, Cave has written novels and poetry while performing and issuing albums regularly. His 2013 release with The Bad Seeds, _Push the Sky Away_, was the band's first Australian number-one album. Cave released his latest album _Carnage_ in 2021, as a duo with long-term member of The Bad Seeds, Warren Ellis."

In 1904, he moved to Sydney; five years later he held his first solo photographic exhibition, which was also the first solo photographic exhibition in Australia. He was the leading photographer for the Home magazine from the early 1920s onward, and his photographs of Sydney over a number of decades have become key images of aspects of Australian history.

                            "Mary Elizabeth Maud Chomley OBE (1872â€“1960) has been described as the 'divine angel of mercy' for Australian prisoners of war during the First World War. A charity worker, arts patron, feminist and amateur artist, she was the eldest daughter of judge Arthur Wolfe Chomley and Juliana, and grew up in Melbourne and later at Dromkeen, the Chomley family's property at Riddells Creek. In her early twenties Mary spent time in Burma and India, and following her mother's death in 1897 took on the running of the family homes. She became involved with the Victorian Ladies' Work Association and, in 1906, was the secretary for the committee who instigated and organised the First Australian Exhibition of Women's Work, which attracted a quarter of a million visitors and is now considered a landmark event in the history of womenâ€™s art in Australia. Chomley was one of the founders of the Arts and Crafts Society of Victoria, and in 1909 became founding secretary of the state branch of the Victoria League for Commonwealth Friendship. She went to England in June 1914 and, prevented from getting home by the outbreak of war, threw herself into work: teaching English to Belgian refugees in London, giving crochet lessons and volunteering at the Robert Lindsay Memorial Hospital for Officers. She then went to France to work at a canteen that supplied food and clothing to British and allied troops. After returning to London, she was superintendent of the domestic staff at Princess Christian's Hospital for Officers, then, in 1916, she joined the newly formed Prisoners of War Department of the Australian Red Cross, coordinating a team of volunteers to distribute thousands of parcels to Australian and New Zealand troops taken prisoner on the Western Front. Her work for the Red Cross was honoured in 1918, when she was awarded an OBE. Remaining in London after the armistice, Chomley was the Australian representative on the Society for the Overseas Settlement of British Women and, from 1925 to 1933, chair of the Women's Section of the British Legion. Chomley returned permanently to Melbourne in 1934, resuming her work with the Victoria League and the Arts and Crafts Society. She died at her home in Toorak, aged 88."

                            "Dymphna Clark (1916-2000), linguist, translator, chatelaine and matriarch, was born Hilma Dymphna Lodewyckx. Of Swedish and Belgian extraction, she learned several languages early in life, including Swedish, picked up from her mother and grandmother. Spending a year in Germany in 1933, she returned to Melbourne to study German at the University of Melbourne. Here she met Manning Clark, who was to become Australia's most influential historian. Marrying at Oxford, the Clarks lived in Canberra from 1949 onward; that year, Manning became inaugural Professor of History at the Canberra University College (later the ANU). In their Forrest home Dymphna raised her six children and entertained countless visitors at meals prepared with produce from her own garden. From the 1960s she taught in the German department at ANU; her son Axel later taught in the English department there, and contributed substantially to the body of critical analysis of Australian literature. Dymphna's translations include several of Manning Clark's books and, notably, The New Holland Journal of Count Carl Von Hugel (1994). The Clarks spent much time at their property at Wapengo, NSW, where Dymphna, an avid plantswoman, revegetated large areas with volunteers."

                            "Ola Cohn OBE (1892-1964), sculptor, was born in Bendigo and studied in Melbourne and London, where Henry Moore, her lecturer in sculpture, predicted that she would progress to make 'works of a very high order'. Returning to Australia in 1931, she established a studio in Melbourne, producing pieces based on the simple lines of ancient Mediterranean art, and gained a reputation as a potent modern artist. Between 1938 and 1941 she made two huge figures for the Royal Hobart Hospital, a memorial fountain in Bendigo, panels for the Mutual Life and Citizen's Building, Sydney, and the massive figure for the Pioneer Women's Memorial in Adelaide. She then turned to teaching, while continuing to produce sculptures for churches. Late in her career she made the fairies' tree for Melbourne's Fitzroy Gardens. Cohn's work is represented in most major Australian galleries."

                            "David Collins (1756â€“1810), lieutenant-governor, began his career in the British Navy, rising to the rank of captain before being returning to dry land and being placed on half-pay in late 1783. Three years later he was commissioned deputy judge advocate of New South Wales. He arrived in the Sirius at Botany Bay on 20 January 1788, and was one of the party that went to size up Port Jackson the next day. There, on 7 February he read the Act, commissions and letters patent inaugurating the government. He was responsible for all legal matters, and before long, for convict labour, health, rations and stores. In December 1791, with the departure of the detachment of marines and the arrival of the New South Wales Corps, his pay was reduced; after his patron, Arthur Phillip left, he was stranded in the colony assisting Francis Grose and then William Paterson. Returning to England in June 1797 he completed volume 1 of An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, which sold well and was translated into German by 1799. Although he tried to stay in England, he was sent to form a new settlement in Bass Strait in 1803. Finding conditions at Port Phillip Bay unpromising, he suggested removal of the settlement to Risdon on the Derwent, but finding that, too, unsuitable he chose Sullivan Cove as the site for Hobart Town. The early years of the settlement he superintended there were gruelling; although he had been made a colonel, his appeals to England for decent supplies were ignored and he was in fact rebuked, from Sydney, for extravagance. His life became worse after the arrival, in March 1809, of William Bligh, who criticised his administration â€“ as had a spiteful Joseph Foveaux in Sydney, years before. Popularly, however, he was well-regarded for his humane approach and cheerful manners. A temporary place of worship was erected over his grave in St. David's Burial Ground in 1810; and in 1817, the foundation stone of the new St. David's Cathedral was laid in his memory. The Collins Streets in Hobart and Melbourne are also named after him."

                            "James Cook (1728-1779), maritime explorer, surveyed and claimed the east coast of Australia on the first of his three great voyages of discovery in the Pacific. Cook's father was a labourer and he attended the village school before gaining a job in a shop. In 1747 he took up an apprenticeship with a coal-shipper in Whitby. Through application to his studies, particularly of mathematics, he prospered, and saw action around the Gulf of St Lawrence, where he developed his extraordinary expertise in surveying and mapping. In mid-1768 he was chosen by the Admiralty to observe the transit of Venus in Tahiti. Henceforth, he was almost continually at sea until his death in early 1779. Cook opened up vast areas that had previously been only tentatively investigated, and charted them with extraordinary accuracy. Accounts produced from his voyages provided Europeans with their first glimpse of the culture, wildlife and geography of lands as diverse as Tahiti and Alaska, and as a result of measures he took to raise standards of hygiene and nutrition on board his ships, there was an appreciable improvement in the health of future British seamen. Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii, on 14 February 1779, after having left and then returned to make essential repairs."

                            "Saw as we came in on both points of the bay, several of the natives and a few huts, men, women and children on the south shore abreast of the ship, to which place I went in the boats in hopes of speaking with them, accompanied by Mr Banks, Dr Solander, and Tupia.\\n\\nAs we approached the shore, they all made off except two men who seemed resolved to oppose our landing. As soon as I saw this, I ordered the boats to lay upon their oars in order to speak to them. But this was to little purpose for neither us nor Tupia could understand one word they said. When then through them some nails, beads, etc. ashore which they took up and seemed not ill-pleased in so much that I thought they beckoned us to come ashore. But in this we were mistaken, for as soon as we put the boat in again, they again came to oppose us, upon which I fired a musket between the two, which had no other effect that to make them retire back where bundles of their darts lay. And one of them took up a stone and threw at us, which caused my firing a second musket load with small shot. And although some of the shot struck the man, yet it had no other effect than to make him lay hold of a shield or target to defend himself.  \\nImmediately after this, we landed, which we had no sooner done than they throwed two darts at us. This obliged me to fire a third shot, soon after which they both made off, but not in such haste but what we might have taken one. But Mr Banks being of opinion that the darts were poisoned made me cautious how I advanced into the woods. We found here a few small huts made of the bark of trees, in one of which were four or five small children, with whom we left some strings of beads etc. A quantity of darts lay about the huts, these we took away with us.",

                            "Carl Cooper (1912-1966), ceramic decorator, contracted poliomyelitis in his twenties. Although he lived in Murrumbeena, he met the Boyd family through John Perceval, who also had polio and whom he had met in hospital. In 1941, Arthur Boyd painted him in his wheelchair, pushed by David Boyd, in a work called _Progression_ which was bought by John Reed. Living close to the AMB pottery established by Arthur Merric Boyd and John Perceval in the mid-1940s, Cooper became interested in making pots himself. Boydâ€™s biographer Darleen Bungey provides a vivid account, based on Boydâ€™s recollections, of what he was like to be around: â€˜His ambitions had been thwarted. Initially he had wanted to be a pilot, or, if not a pilot, then a steward for BOAC, the British airline. Polio grounded him, hitting him harder than Perceval and sentencing him to life in a wheelchair. These two men together made Arthurâ€™s life a misery: â€œJohn and Carl . . . it was like living with a cat and a mouse . . . . constantly fighting, constantly brawling . . . and it came back to rest on usâ€. If Carl wasnâ€™t creating chaos at the pottery, he was disrupting Open Country: â€œHe used to wind himself around to our house . . . heâ€™d have terrible fights with people . . . throw things and lash out at anyone at the nearest point to him.â€ Arthurâ€™s description of Carl Cooper, â€œdissatisfied, fierce, crushedâ€, is confirmed in a series of portraits. In each painting he seems both mentally and physically uncomfortable. His head is held stiffly, his neck set at a rigid angle. The only movement in one work comes from the loose rendering of his jacket, suggesting the momentum of wildly spinning arms.â€™ Cooper lived with the orphan Barry Gordon, who pushed him up to the pottery each day. Gordon mixed the clay and Boyd and Perceval threw pots for Cooper to decorate until Cooperâ€™s â€˜explosive, jealous, possessiveâ€™ personality led to brawls, usually with Perceval. Cooperâ€™s pieces were characteristically functional earthenware, incised or painted in designs influenced by Aboriginal bark paintings he had seen reproduced in _Art in Australia_. Sometime after 1945, Cooper set up his own studio. He was often too ill to work and eventually ceased production in 1963. The National Gallery of Australia has nine of his pieces."

                            "Grace Cossington Smith OBE (1892â€“1984) was a pioneer of modernist art in Australia. Born in Sydney, Cossington Smith began her training in art in 1910 with the Italian-born teacher, Antonio Dattilo Rubbo, who she later described as 'the only one in Sydney at that time who knew anything about the modern masters'. Her parents, Ernest and Grace Smith, supported her pursuit of art, enabling her to spend two years studying in England, where she was inspired by post-impressionism. She returned to Rubbo's classes in Sydney in 1914 and the following year her painting _The Sock Knitter_, considered the first post-impressionist work painted in Australia, was included in the Royal Art Society exhibition. Around 1920, she adopted the surname Cossington Smith, 'Cossington' being the name of the family home in Turramurra where Grace lived and worked for almost 65 years. Despite the hostility of the conservative Sydney art establishment, Cossington Smith became one of a group of artists who stayed resolute in their exploration of modernism. In the late 1920s, she began exhibiting with the Contemporary Group (established in 1926 by George Lambert and Thea Proctor) and held the first of many solo exhibitions; in the same period she commenced work on her exhilarating and now celebrated series of paintings of the Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction. Following the deaths of her parents in the 1930s, Cossington Smith moved from her garden studio to one attached to the main house and during the 1940s began to focus on intimate paintings of interiors, in which she expressed forms with colour and light. Her contribution to Australian art went largely unrecognised until, at age 81, she was honoured with a retrospective exhibition, which opened at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1973 and toured to state galleries. She was awarded an OBE the same year. She eventually left Cossington and moved to a nursing home, where she died at the age of 92 in December 1984. Her works have since become among those most recognised in the collections of major galleries and in the canon of modern art in Australia."

I used to be very fond of the bush but now I canâ€™t manage to go out in the bush.\\n\\nThe large painting which I have in the Wills art prize competition is an interior. Itâ€™s a room with a wardrobe and a bed and a carpet but the chief thing to me was the yellow walls, so that is why I call it _Interior in Yellow_. It was a very exciting thing to do. I wanted to express the forms in colour with the light because the whole thing is meant to express an interior with the light.\\n\\nI use squares in the way I paint, not from a conscious way but it came to me naturally because I feel in that way that light can be put into the colour. whereas just to put colour on to the surface in a flat way, I feel that it gives it a dead look.\\n\\nThe room is in my own home here and the sunlight did not come in in a definite way but the whole room seemed to be full of light, which is what I want to do more than the actual sunlight. I feel that even the shadows are a subdued light and they must have light in them as well as the light parts.",

In between four- and six-year stints as a staff artist for the Melbourne Guardian, in the early 1950s he worked for the World Trade Union Movement in London. In Melbourne, throughout the 1950s and 1960s he exhibited pictures of miners, construction workers, demonstrations and other scenes of working-class life. Between 1951 and 1960 his work was shown in London, Warsaw, Copenhagen, Moscow and Leningrad; during this period he won the Crouch Prize twice, the McCaughey Prize and the VS drawing prize as well as a bronze medal at the International Graphics exhibition in Leipzig. In 1969 he exhibited in Poland and the USSR. The NGV held a survey of his work in 1973, in which year he also had a survey show at the Commonwealth Gallery in London; in 1974 he had a residency at the CitÃ© in Paris. In 1982 he lived in France, and produced a body of work depicting French village life."

                            "The Rt Hon Sir Zelman Cowen AK GCMG GCVO QC DCL (1919-2011), academic, writer and former Governor-General, was educated at Scotch College and the University of Melbourne before serving in the navy in the Second World War. After the war, he went to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. From 1951 to 1966 he was dean of the law faculty at the University of Melbourne; during this period he worked often in American universities, advised the British government on constitutional issues and wrote the biography of Sir Isaac Isaacs, Australian-born Jewish governor-general. In 1970 he became Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland. Seven years later, at the invitation of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, he succeeded Sir John Kerr as Governor-General, where he did much to restore the status of the vice-regal post. Returning to Oxford University in the 1980s, he became Provost of Oriel College and later Pro-Vice Chancellor. He published widely on aspects of law but also attempted to enhance public comprehension of perplexing constitutional issues, particularly the question of an Australian republic. Cowen's autobiography, _A Public Life_, was published in 2006."

                            "Ruth Cracknell AM (1925â€“2002), actor, became a household name through her character Maggie Beare in the ABC comedy _Mother and Son_, which ran from 1985 to 1994. Grounded in theatrical practice by her mother and seven unmarried aunts, Cracknell joined an amateur drama club at seventeen. She left for England in 1952, where she worked in radio drama with the BBC. Returning to Australia in 1954 she joined the Phillip Street Theatre, in 1965 heading the cast of _A Cup of Tea, a Bex and a Good Lie Down_. Over the ensuing years she appeared in many plays, including a memorable performance as Lady Bracknell in _The Importance of Being Earnest_ for the Melbourne and Sydney theatre companies, which was staged several times from 1988 to 1992. She was a member of the STC Board of Directors from 1980 until 1994, and a Patron from 1994 to 2002. Meanwhile, her film career began with a role in _Smiley Gets a Gun_ (1958), and was followed by roles in films including _The Singer and the Dancer_ (1977), _The Night the Prowler_ (1978), _The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith_ (1977), _The Dismissal_ (1983), _Spider and Rose_ (1994) and _Lilian's Story_ (1996). Her autobiography, _A Biased Memoir_ (1997), was followed by a thoughtful and affecting account of the death of her husband and her own 'journey' through grief, _Journey From Venice_ (2000). In 2001 she received the Gold Logie Hall of Fame Award and a lifetime achievement award at the Helpmann Awards. Cracknell was an influential spokesperson for older Australian women and an advocate for Aboriginal rights."

                            "Ray Crooke AM grew up in Melbourne, where after army service in WA, North Queensland and Borneo, he trained at Swinburne Tech from 1946 to 1948. Having worked for two years on Thursday Island for the Diocese of Carpentaria, he began painting scenes of island life. Comparisons with Gauguin are inevitable, though Crooke often painted people in dim interiors against a window giving onto bright light. A long-time resident of Cairns, he travelled extensively in northern Australia and painted some remarkably evocative landscapes, such as _Chillagoe_ 1962, _Landscape with rocks in foreground_ 1967 and _Ant Hill Country, Laura_ 1969, all in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. In 1966 he served as an official war artist in Vietnam. He won the Archibald Prize in 1969 for a portrait of a close friend, the writer George Johnson. In the mid-1990s he donated his collection of works by Drysdale, Friend, Olley and Boyd to Perc Tucker Regional Gallery, Townsville, which mounted _North of Capricorn_, a major retrospective of his work that toured in 1998-1999. Crooke is represented in all major Australian galleries and his work remains popular amongst collectors."

That is why I think that I found the pattern in the islands, the simple island people living in some sort of crude harmony with nature, so exciting and fascinating. This relationship is deeper than just a decorative pattern of people walking in tropical foliage, itâ€™s something which I have always felt myself. Iâ€™ve always been interested in the study of nature, from the smallest facets of insects up to birds and animals and plants, not in a scientific way but in a practical way, in a sense of wonderment; the beauty and the sort of mystery about them is very important to me. In fact, this feeling of wonder, to be able to sort of see these things with some sort of fresh vision, is the thing that I find most important to keep.\\n\\nThe relationship of the man to his environment is quite a problem pictorially because although I want to paint man in relation to nature, I also want to paint good paintings, that is, paintings that have the values of paint and colour and shape and so on. So all the facets of a good painting â€“ design, texture, and all the values and so on â€“ I try and I hope that I can weld them into this one simple expression of man in some form of dignified harmony with the natural world around him.",

                            "June Dally-Watkins OAM (1927â€“2020), model, deportment icon and entrepreneur, grew up on a property at Watsons Creek in the New England district of New South Wales. After suffering many insults as the daughter of a single mother, as a teenager she was noticed on a Tamworth street by a photographer, who encouraged her to move to Sydney and try her luck at modelling. She described herself as 'looking like a milkmaid' at the time she scored her first assignments for major department stores, but she was named Model of the Year in 1949. Catwalk shows for David Jones followed, along with contracts for magazines including the _Australian Women's Weekly_ and _Woman's Day_. At the age of 22, in 1950, she established the June Dally-Watkins School, which has since trained countless students in deportment and etiquette in Sydney and Brisbane. The following year she established Australia's first modelling agency and, later, a business college. Famously romanced by actor Gregory Peck during a visit to Rome in the 1950s, she returned to Australia to continue her career, marry and raise four children. In 1969 she published _The June Dally-Watkins Book of Manners for Moderns_. Dally-Watkins took her etiquette lessons to students in China in 2013, co-founding the Dally Institute in Guangzhou. Her autobiography _The Secrets Behind My Smile_ was published in 2002. Dally-Watkins died at the age of 92, leaving a lasting legacy not only on the Australian modelling industry, but on the thousands of students to whom she imparted impeccable manners and a knowledge of etiquette."

                            "William Dampier (1651-1715), seafarer and writer, had spent a good deal of time at sea as a buccaneer and merchant sailor before he spent three months in 1688 around King Sound (northern Western Australia) on the Cygnet. After further trading voyages in southeast Asia he returned to England, where he wrote accounts of his travels that became very popular. Regarding him as an authority on the region, the Admiralty made him captain of the Roebuck, dispatched to explore the South Seas in January 1699. In August, he reached the coast of what is now Western Australia and named Shark Bay, but he could not find fresh water and after four weeks he departed for Timor. His impression of the west coast landscape was unfavourable and he described the Indigenous inhabitants as â€˜the miserablest People in the Worldâ€™. Although he named New Britain (separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier Strait) in the early months of 1700, his ship was not fit for much further exploration and he returned to England, where in 1702 he was declared unfit to lead any more expeditions on behalf of the king. Nonetheless, he led a farcical privateering expedition south in 1703 and was a pilot on a worldwide voyage between 1708 and 1711. Dampier was of greater historical importance as an author than an explorer; his influential New Voyage Round the World, published in 1697, ran to many editions, and several further successful volumes followed. His works remain of interest to historians, navigators and meteorologists, as well as students of the literature of Swift and Defoe. Diana and Michael Prestonâ€™s biography A Pirate of Exquisite Mind was published in 2005; the authors point out that through his writings, Dampier introduced many words including â€˜chopsticksâ€™ and â€˜barbecueâ€™ into English. In 2015 the Western Australian Museum held a series of events to commemorate the tricentennial of Dampierâ€™s visit to the west coast."

In his late years, he was more interested in art than architecture, and after 1798 his Academy contributions consisted solely of chalk portraits of his friends, 72 of which were engraved and published between 1808 and 1814. For some years, he was the last survivor of the 40 original Academicians. Many of his portraits - though not his portrait of Westall - are now held by the National Portrait Gallery, London."

Daniell entered the Royal Academy schools in 1799, the same year as Willaim Westall; he was elected an Associate in 1807 and, unlike Westall, a full academician in 1822. Daniell was originally offered the job of official artist on the Investigator; having accepted, he withdrew from the expedition, and Westall was appointed. In 1802, Daniell began his many years translating George Dance's series of half-length portraits of 'eminent characters' into soft ground etching. In 1814 a number of these were selected for publication in two volumes, with a preface by Dance. His other works include Oriental Scenery (1795-1808)."

                            "Neale Daniher AO, Australian Football player, coach and general manager, was born in West Wyalong, New South Wales in 1961. One of four brothers who made up the Daniher football dynasty, Neale was signed with the Essendon Football Club from the beginning of his career, in 1979 through to 1990; playing 82 games and kicking 32 goals despite being plagued with injury. After retiring as a player, Daniher was assistant coach for the Essendon and Fremantle football clubs. In 1998 he was appointed as senior coach to the Melbourne Football Club, where he steered the team for 10 seasons. During this time Daniher led the Demons to the 2000 AFL Grand Final against Essendon. Leaving coaching in 2007, he was appointed general manager of football operations at the West Coast Eagles in 2008 until his retirement in 2013.\\n\\nDaniher was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) in 2013, and made his diagnosis public the following year, when he co-founded the organisation FightMND with Pat Cunningham. FightMND's purpose is to research effective treatments, and eventually a cure, for Motor Neurone Disease. In 2015, Daniher became the public face of the foundation's biggest fundraising event, The Big Freeze, held during the annual Queen's Birthday football match between Melbourne and Collingwood at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. FightMND has raised and subsequently invested over $50 million into research and care initiatives since its foundation in 2014.\\n\\nDaniher was awarded the Member of the Order of Australia in 2016 for his efforts in raising awareness of MND and raising funds to help find a cure for the disease. In 2018 he was named the fourth-ever recipient of the AFL's John Kennedy Lifetime Achievement Award, recognising 'extraordinary and positive contribution to the game of Australian Football across multiple parts of the game'. In 2019 Daniher was named Victorian of the Year and released his memoir, _When All is Said & Done_, which won the 2020 Australian Book Industry Awards Biography of the Year. In recognition of his contribution to AFL coaching, in 2019, the AFL Coaches Association renamed their premier award the Neale Daniher AFL Coaches Association Lifetime Achievement Award. In the Queen's Birthday Honours List in 2021, Daniher was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia, for his ongoing charity work."

                            "The way that I approach a painting is to try to cut out as far as possible from my thinking the associations, the normal everyday associations I have with the subject. Letâ€™s say that I am painting a portrait. Well, I donâ€™t look at my subject as a person as we think of a person in normal circumstances; I think of my subject in terms of the medium in which I can express myself, that is, paints on a canvas, and I have to think of the limitations of this means of expression.\\n\\nI have only a certain number of coloured pigments which I can apply to a flat surface. And on a very sort of superficial analysis it can be seen at once that all that a painter has at his disposal to express his thoughts are colours which are light or dark in varying degrees, colours which are warm or cool, and certain shapes disposed in certain proportions. As we often say, we can only express ourselves by means of tone, proportion and colour, tone being the intensity of the pigment, proportion being the disposition of various shapes and colour, of course, is simply this matter of warmth or coolness. There is actually nothing else that we have to use. Weâ€™ve got no soul, no expression, no â€“ we havenâ€™t even got a three dimension. We have to give the illusion of a three dimension by the way in which we relate our three elements: tone, proportion and colour.\\n\\nWhen it comes to expressing a mood, well, we havenâ€™t any mood paint on our canvas, we have to arrange again our colours, our elements, in such a way that we can convey to the spectator some feeling which we have had.",

Under her leadership the Gallery grew from a small institution located in Old Parliament House to a significant Federal institution in its own building. Having studied science at the University of Queensland, Darling worked in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Melbourne in the late 1960s, and undertook postgraduate study in the Medical School of Monash University from 1973 to 1978. Soon her interests expanded to a variety of social and cultural concerns, including the Victorian Children's Aid Society and the Victorian State Opera Foundation. By the mid-1980s she was a major patron of art, music and health in the Australian community. After she married Gordon Darling in 1989, the couple convened the exhibition _Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery_, which toured nationally from 1992â€“1993. It demonstrated the potential for the institution and proved to be the impetus for its foundation. Since the Gallery was established in 1998 she has funded the acquisition of many diverse works for its collection. Marilyn Darling is the Deputy Chair of the Gordon Darling Foundation and a member of the National Gallery of Australiaâ€™s Gordon Darling Australia Pacific Print Fund."

In 1991 he established the Gordon Darling Foundation, which continues to provide funding and staff development opportunities for public art institutions Australia-wide. That year, too, he and Marilyn Darling initiated the Darling Foundation-sponsored touring exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery, the interest generated by which led to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery, housed first in the National Library of Australia, then in Old Parliament House and then in its own building on King Edward Terrace, Parkes."

                            "Matthias (or Matthew) Darly, printseller, engraver, caricaturist and furniture designer, served an apprenticeship to a clockmaker before opening a print shop in London in the 1740s. By 1749 he had published the first of his designs for carved furniture. In 1751 he published A New Book of Chinese, Gothic and Modern Chairs, and in 1753 he shared a premises for several months with designer Thomas Chippendale while working on the plates for Chippendaleâ€™s The Gentlemanâ€™s and Cabinet-Makerâ€™s Director (1754). Around the same time Darly was also producing and selling wallpapers (decorated with â€˜Modern, Gothic or Chinese Designsâ€™), and decorative motifs for porcelain, delftware and printed cotton. In 1757, having moved to a new location on The Strand, Darly began publishing caricatures which are described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as representing â€˜the first occasion on which caricature â€“ exaggeration of facial features â€“ was fused with political satire.â€™ Darlyâ€™s second wife, Mary (active 1760â€“1781) â€“ also a printseller and a self-styled â€˜Fun Merchantâ€™ â€“ increasingly took on responsibility for this side of the business, and in 1762 published Principals of Caricatura, credited as the earliest book on the subject. Matthias meanwhile continued publishing furniture and architectural designs. His A New Book of Ceilings was published in 1760 and he contributed to books such as Household Furniture in Genteel Taste (also 1760) and A Universal System of Household Furniture (1762). The Darlyâ€™s shop on the Strand â€“ the subject of a 1772 etching, published by Matthias, called â€˜The Macaroni Print Shopâ€™ â€“ also sold â€˜materials of every kind used in the Polite Arts of Drawing, Etching, & c. with all Sorts of drawing books for young Ladies and Gentlemenâ€™, as well as â€˜Ladies Stencils for painting Silks, Linens, Paper &c.â€™, portraits and historical prints. By the early 1770s, having occasionally fallen foul of the Establishment with their caricatures, the Darlys had begun focussing on fashion, publishing images such as â€˜The Ridiculous Taste, or the Ladies Absurdityâ€™ (c. 1771) and â€˜The Extravaganza, or the Mountain Headdress of 1776â€™, which lampooned the taste for preposterous hairstyles and wigs. The Darlys continued to publish caricatures regularly until Matthiasâ€™s death in January 1780. Prints by both Darlys are held in several prestigious print collections including those of the British Museum and the Bodleian Library, Oxford."

                            "Janet Dawson (b. 1935), painter, printer, teacher and stage designer, is known for her contribution to abstract art in Australia. Born in Sydney, she spent the first six years of her life in the rural New South Wales town of Forbes. Dawson's mother, who had studied art with Will Ashton, recognised her daughter's talent early and was advised by Ashton to encourage it. She had her first formal lessons following her family's relocation to Melbourne in the early 1940s, attending the private art school run by artist and illustrator Harold Septimus Power. In 1951, aged sixteen, she enrolled at the National Gallery School and attended night classes with Sir William Dargie. Five years later, Dawson won a National Gallery of Victoria Travelling Scholarship and went to London, where she enrolled at the Slade School and the Central School to study painting, etching and lithography. She travelled in Italy and worked as a proof printer in Paris before returning to Melbourne in 1961. She held her first solo exhibition the same year and in 1963 set up an art school and workshop, where she printed the work of artists such as Albert Tucker, Charles Blackman and Russell Drysdale. Dawson was one of only three women included in the renowned exhibition of Australian abstraction, _The Field_, at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1968. After several years in Sydney, Dawson moved to live in the bush near Binalong, NSW, in 1973. That year, she won the Archibald Prize with a portrait of her husband, the late writer, actor and playwright Michael Boddy. In 1978, she and Boddy founded The Bugle Press, producing fine art books and prints. Her work is represented in all major public collections in Australia, and has been the subject of exhibitions at the National Gallery of Victoria (1979), the National Gallery of Australia (1996) and a 2006 touring exhibition, _Janet Dawson Survey_."

                            "From the point of view of method, I find that my method has changed radically, as of course it must do. I used to work very directly without preparing very much. Now I find that although I must work directly, I usually work on about three or four paintings and a series of drawings before anything final comes out of this. A final, or a finalised painting, quite often happens fairly quickly. With my particular method it must be very fresh. I find that very clean, very fresh colour is essential. I find tremendous sensual delight in clarity and finality of area, so consequently a painting canâ€™t possibly have any labour on its actual surface, the labour must go on in other places. And I find that the more I work, the more prolonged are these periods of making studies and drawings.\\n\\nI find that Iâ€™m continually going back to the figure as being something that contains so much, so many possibilities. Through exploration, probably like all good sensualists, I keep finding the figure in landscape and the landscape in the figure; areas of flesh stretched across muscle or relaxed, tightened up, loose flesh, delicate little veins, bony areas, are things that I feel with tremendous ecstasy that Iâ€™ve never yet been able to put down in any way, something that Iâ€™m trying very hard to do at the moment.",

                            "Michelle de Kretser (b. 1957), author, came to Melbourne with her Sinhalese Dutch parents in 1972. The once-prosperous family lived in reduced circumstances, but she attended a multi-cultural school in Elwood. She took her masterâ€™s degree in literature in Paris and began a PhD at the University of Melbourne, where she co-founded a postgraduate journal, Antithesis. Abandoning her doctorate, she was employed by Lonely Planet, where she worked for a decade on guidebooks; she founded the companyâ€™s Paris office. Her first novel, The Rose Grower, was published in 1999. The Hamilton Case was followed by The Lost Dog, which won the 2008 NSW Premierâ€™s Book of the Year Award and was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and the Orange Prize for Fiction the same year. In 2009 de Kretser moved to Sydney with her partner and dogs. Her fourth novel, Questions of Travel (2012) was widely reviewed in Australia, the UK and the USA. It won the Miles Franklin Literary Award and the Prime Ministerâ€™s Award for Fiction in 2013, and at the 2014 New South Wales Premierâ€™s Literary Awards it was named Book of the Year, won the Christina Stead Prize for Fiction and shared the Multicultural Award. De Kretserâ€™s latest release is the novella Springtime (2014), a ghost story set in Sydney."

                            "Sir William Dobell (1899â€“1970), painter, studied art and was apprentice to an architect in Sydney before leaving Australia for Europe in 1929. On his return to Sydney after a decade he managed to impress conservative and modernist art factions alike. In the Second World War, Dobell served in a camouflage unit and the Civil Construction Corps of the Allied Works Council. Out of this experience, in 1943, came two portraits: one of Joe Westcott, a loudmouthed, indolent wharfie, titled _The Billy Boy_; and another of fellow artist and camoufleur, Joshua Smith. Both paintings were hung in the Archibald Prize exhibition that year, and the portrait of Smith was announced the winner. The decision was challenged, however, by a faction of conservative artists who claimed that Dobell's painting of his friend was a caricature, not a portrait, and who took the matter to court. Meanwhile, the National Art Gallery (as the AGNSW was then known) extended the exhibition dates and by March 1944 the painting had reportedly been viewed by over 140,000 people. The court eventually found in Dobell's favour â€“ his lawyers having persuasively argued that likeness and photographic accuracy weren't necessarily one and the same thing. Dobell was affected physically and emotionally by the controversy and gave up painting for some time.\\n\\nSlowly, the artist rebuilt his career; he won both the Wynne Prize for landscape and the Archibald Prize for the second time, with a portrait of Margaret Olley, in 1948. He won another Archibald in 1959, and _Time_ magazine commissioned his portrait of Robert Menzies for its cover in 1960. These and other successes of Dobell's, including his knighthood, conferred in 1966, did much to increase the status of artists in Australia."

Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia.\\n\\nI was approached by a magazine from America to do this particular job for a special issue that is coming out within a week or two, and for that purpose I had to travel to Canberra and interview the Prime Minister in the offices of Parliament House. And there I made my studies. They consisted of small watercolour paintings, and I think altogether I had about 40 minutes with the Prime Minister for this purpose.\\n\\nI always paint, as I think, a straight portrait and I go for the character of the person and, in this case, I think there was very strong character and Iâ€™d be very foolish to play around and do silly things with an international figure of that type. And I think I got a fairly good job done in the time allowed me.\\n\\nOh well, weâ€™ll see the results when they come out.\\n\\nUsually I like to get to know a person well before I do a portrait, sometimes at least a week, or have a few drinks with them or dine with them, to get them relaxed and to pick out their salient mannerisms. In the case of Mr Menzies, I have only met him once or twice over a period of about 15 years, socially, so I really didnâ€™t know him, which made the job more difficult. And in this particular case, in the surrounds of Parliament House and offices, there is a tenseness, and relaxing was really a frightening business. I couldnâ€™t really relax, and I had to take my studies away, then try to get everything from that build-up, with what I remembered of him. As I say, I didnâ€™t really know the man well.",

                            "Iâ€™ve often been asked why I became an artist. It was just a natural thing, I always wanted to draw, just as almost every kiddy does. But with me it just stuck, and all through school I liked drawing much better than any of the other lessons., as a matter of fact I was very poor at the other lessons. In the town of Newcastle where I lived there were no opportunities to study art, so I took the next best thing. I became apprenticed to an architect. Although that was mechanical drawing, in a way it satisfied me for the time being.\\n\\nThen I was able to come to Sydney later on, and I gave away architecture and started to study art at an art school.\\n\\nAs you go through studying, you get more and more keen, and then â€“ well, you just get into it. I went away to England on scholarships and studied abroad and saw the best works all around the world. It really becomes a mania, eventually, in art.\\n\\nI have often been asked what it is that makes me want to paint certain people. Well, I think, first of all, itâ€™s the interesting form, the sculptural form of the person and the strong characters of a person, the strong individuality. And I strive for that. I donâ€™t know whether other artists do it or not, but personally I like to fit them to my style. I see them as my style of painting and try to bring that style first. Itâ€™s a sculptural technique, more like sculpture than painting. And if I see those things in a person, well, I strive for it like a piece of sculpture. I particularly like the Gothic type of sculpture, and I try to get that into my better works.",

                            "Ken Done (b. 1940), painter, studied at East Sydney Tech before becoming an advertising graphic designer. He gave up work to paint full time in 1980. Soon, his stylised, colourful representations of Sydney's beaches, harbour, animals and flowers found their way onto placemats, t-shirts, bibs, swimwear, sheets, mugs and vases. In 1987, when Ellis took this photograph for Playboy, Done had an annual turnover of more than $4 million. Ellis spent time with him at his studio on the water at Chinaman's Beach in Middle Harbour, finding him to have 'a strong sense of himself as successful designer, entrepreneur and celebrity [but with] a humble side to him that keeps things well in perspective and will not allow him to be seduced by success.' Done recently told George Negus that sneers at his 'commercial' art by critics and other artists worried him - 'I'd be tougher than I really am if I told you that it didn't hurt sometimes' - but his business has endured, and his paintings still sell well, particularly in the UK and Japan. Done was named Australia's Father of the Year in 1989 and Mosman Citizen of the Year in 1993 and he was Australia's Goodwill Ambassador to UNICEF in 1993. A large exhibition of his art from the 1980s toured New South Wales between 1991 and 1993. The Powerhouse Museum, the restaurant of which was decorated by Done in the early 1990s, held a large solo exhibition of his work in 1994-1995."

                            "Lady Maisie Drysdale (1915â€“2001), children's librarian and artists' muse, developed an interest in art as a child, and attended both the University of Melbourne and George Bell's art school. Her fellow students at the George Bell School included Peter Purves Smith and Russell Drysdale, who had been at Geelong Grammar together. In 1937, Purves Smith left for Europe, followed in 1938 by Maisie and her mother. After Maisie returned home Purves Smith cabled his proposal to her but they were separated for the duration of the war. They married in 1946 in Melbourne, with Drysdale as best man; however, Purves Smith died following surgery to relieve symptoms of tuberculosis in 1949. Three years later, Maisie completed studies at the Public Library of Victoria, Library Training School and in 1953 was appointed Deputy Librarian at the City of Coburg Library. Later she was appointed Children's Librarian and given the responsibility of setting up the Children's Library, selecting and cataloguing the books. Having spent a few years managing the Austral Bookshop in Collins Street, from 1958 to 1963 she was Children's Librarian at the Camberwell City Library, and served on the Editorial Committee of the Children's Book Council of Victoria. During this time she also published reviews of children's books. In November 1963, Drysdale's wife died, and seven months later he and Maisie married. They bought a block of land on the Central Coast near Gosford, named it Bouddi Farm, and commissioned Melbourne architect Guilford Bell to design a house for them there. They lived there for the rest of their lives, though they travelled widely; Maisie outlived him by twenty years, and continued to travel."

It becomes something thatâ€™s a passing thing that people are not quite aware of themselves.\\n\\nIâ€™ve always been interested in the elemental in art and in Australia with the background of Aboriginals. We find that many artists have expressed themselves in various ways on what should be the expression of the Australian beginnings, which is the Aboriginals. But I search for the elemental thing, the depths of their past, the feeling of them living in this country and so forth. But further than that, I do find in the Australian bush there is the spirit of the elemental. One can feel it. Youâ€™re aware of it when you go silently into it.\\n\\nWhen I am approaching painting of a landscape, I firstly am aware of my subject. I want to know more of it. I walk into it. I must walk around and round all those trees and into the distance and the space that fills them, to listen, to find that feeling thatâ€™s vibrating, so as I can set it down in the spirit of that thing which I think is the essence that I should express.",

During his premierships, South Australia was in the vanguard of social and political reform in this country, introducing much progressive legislation pertaining to sex discrimination, Aboriginal rights, decriminalisation of homosexuality, industrial relations, environmental conservation, and electoral reform. It was also at this time that Adelaide's Festival of the Arts became a cultural event of international stature. On one occasion Dunstan wore pink shorts in Parliament as a symbol of his commitment to change. This piece of frivolity notwithstanding, he revitalised State politics and was a major influence on later State Labor premiers."

                            "Max Dupain OBE (1911â€“1992) was a pioneering modernist photographer. Born in Sydney, he received his first camera as a teenager and trained with photographer Cecil Bostock while working as his assistant. After setting up his own studio in 1934, Dupain established his reputation with portraiture and advertising work, gained exposure in the lifestyle magazine _The Home_, and photographed ballet dancers for the ABC, including dancers from the Kirsova Ballet and the three Ballets Russes companies that toured Australia between 1936 and 1940. While Dupain was on service during the Second World War, he briefly worked for the Department of Information from 1945 to 1947, photographing Australia for propaganda purposes. His then-wife Olive Cotton, one of very few professional women photographers in Australia, ran his studio. In the 1950s Dupain turned increasingly to architectural photography, collaborating in particular with architects Samuel Lipson, Sydney Ancher and Harry Seidler. From 1958 to 1973 he documented the construction of the Sydney Opera House. During the same period, he began photographing historic properties for the National Trust and recorded Canberra's new buildings for the National Capital Development Commission. In 1975 the Australian Centre for Photography mounted the touring exhibition _Max Dupain: A Retrospective 1930â€“1975_. This show brought Dupain's name to the attention of the wider public, and turned _The Sunbaker_, taken nearly 40 years earlier, into a definitive Australian image. Dupain continued to operate his studio on Sydney's Lower North Shore until he died at the age of 81."

                            "Iâ€™ve been asked if I have any favourite pictures of my own. I have to say no. And I looked through the catalogue of the retrospective exhibition just to check, and I find that all these pictures that I have in this show, 81 out of about 4,000, represent my responses to the environment in which I find myself, and thatâ€™s all there is to it. Thereâ€™s nothing world-shattering in any of these shots, they are just a simple and largely emotional response to an environment. Just little things: there might be grass growing in the sand, it might be a person, it might be a landscape at dusk, it might be an industrial operation at night. But this is my world. And I have no favourites. I just hope and worked towards the end that photography to me is my way of expressing my personal response to my environment. And thatâ€™s all there is to it.\\n\\nJust by way of a diversion, thereâ€™s a picture in the exhibition called _The Meat Queue_, which is a very good example of how lucky can you be. It consists of four or five old mums in a meat queue just after the war, in Sydney. I was doing a story on queues for the Department of Information at the time. I was in this butcherâ€™s shop and I just suddenly saw this action, and it was all over in a fraction of a second. Thereâ€™s movement in it, thereâ€™s a lot of intense feeling on the faces of these people, these women, and it has been one of the most, one of the favourite pictures in this show. But just sheer luck. There were half a dozen other photographs taken of this queuing operation in this butcherâ€™s shop at the time and not one of them are anything like this one.",

                            "The true photographers are not interested in equipment as such, theyâ€™re interested in what it will do and this is the important thing â€“ through the man, of course, not just automatic equipment that will take of its own volition. It has to be manipulated.\\n\\nOut of this great conglomeration of photo machinery, I have selected a few cameras which I try to keep to a minimum. My favourite camera is the Linhof, itâ€™s a 5 x 4 format, and I come back to this thing time and time and time again. We use a Hasselblad also for quick work, particularly for portrait work, and also a 35 mm camera. You can do an awful lot of work with those three cameras, and I try and keep it in that simple form.\\n\\nThe same applies to film and print paper. For black and white work, we use one line of Kodak film, and our print paper all comes from Ilford which we consider the best available here.\\n\\nNow, for colour work, which is supposed to be the up-and-coming thing but I doubt it very much â€“ Iâ€™m essentially a black and white man but we do a lot of colour work because we have to â€“ but until colour becomes a very much more controllable operation, I think black and white will still be, or will remain the intrinsic, inherent photographic medium. If you go to an exhibition of colour photography by a dozen photographers, itâ€™s very, very hard to find out whoâ€™s done what, they all look exactly alike, because the operation is essentially a mechanical one and the personal ingredient is minimised.",

                            "Geoff Dyer (1947-2020) was renowned landscape and portrait painter whose practice depicted Tasmania and its people. Dyer was born in Hobart and studied at the Tasmanian School of Art between 1965 and 1968. He started exhibiting in the 1970s while working as a teacher and then a lecturer, initially at the Launceston School of Art and then at Burnie Technical College. In 1995, he won an Art Gallery of NSW residency at the CitÃ© Internationale des Arts, Paris. Primarily a landscape artist, much of Dyerâ€™s work was inspired by Tasmania, his subjects including such iconic places as the Franklin River, the South West World Heritage Area, Cradle Mountain and Lake St. Clare. He was a finalist in the Wynne Prize nine times (1977, 1988â€“1993, 1997, 2004); and the Sulman Prize twice (1997, 2006). Dyer painted one portrait per year (generally of a fellow Tasmanian) for entry in the Archibald Prize. He became an Archibald finalist for the first time in 1993 with his portrait of environmentalist and former federal leader of The Greens, Bob Brown; and ten years later took out the Prize with his portrait of novelist Richard Flanagan. He was again a finalist in the 2011 prize for his portrait of MONA founder, David Walsh. Dyer was commissioned by the Tasmanian Government to paint the official portrait of former state Premier Paul Lennon for the Parliament House collection. Dyer exhibited regularly in solo and group exhibitions since 1970 and his work is represented in many collections, including those of Artbank; the University of Tasmania; the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Hobart; the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Launceston aand the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Hobart."

                            "Herbert Vere Evatt (1894â€“1965) was a Labor politician, judge, historian and statesman. In 1930, aged 36, Evatt became the youngest judge ever appointed to the High Court of Australia. Elected to Federal Parliament in 1940, he held the seat of Barton for 18 years. From 1941 to 1949 he was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs, and during this period he also served as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In 1951, he became Leader of the Opposition. In 1949, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was established, and soon thousands of supposed communists were threatened with jail in the event of a war. When Prime Minister Menzies attempted to outlaw the Communist Party in Australia, Evatt led the effort to defeat the proposal. A referendum saw the Partyâ€™s legitimacy confirmed. Evatt led the Labor Party until 1960."

Emigrating from Britain with his family when young, he started out as an apprentice plumber before his first musical success in 1968 with the single â€˜Sadieâ€™. He was voted Australiaâ€™s King of Pop five years in a row between 1969 and 1973, when he also appeared in a variety of stage shows and musicals. \\n\\nHe career stalled for the second half of the 1970s. He formed a band and went back on the performance circuit from 1982, for a time replacing Glenn Shorrock as the lead singer in the Little River Band. He returned to the charts with a version of the Beatles hit â€˜Helpâ€™ in the mid-eighties.\\n\\nWhen Farnham returned to a solo career, his Whispering Jack album emerged as the largest selling album in Australiaâ€™s history. The single from the album, â€˜Youâ€™re the Voiceâ€™, was a Top Ten hit in the United Kingdom in 1987, the year in which he was named Australian of the Year â€˜for his outstanding contribution to the Australian music industry over twenty yearsâ€™. He received 19 Aria Awards, was recognised as an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1996, was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001 and inducted into the Aria Hall of Fame in 2003."

                            "Maurice Appleby Felton (1803-1842) arrived in Sydney with his wife and four children in late 1839 as surgeon to the immigrant ship the Royal Admiral. Although listed in July of the following year as one of the colony's 'duly qualified medical practitioners', Felton had also by this time established himself as a portrait painter. In January 1840, Felton exhibited examples of his paintings at a shop on George Street. This led to an acquaintance with the merchant and arts patron Alexander Brodie Spark. In September 1840, 'Mr Felton, Surgeon, top of Hunter Street' impressed the Sydney Herald with his 'fine, life size portrait of Her Majesty Queen Victoria' - a copy of the portrait by Thomas Sully, which Felton had seen in England. In December 1840, The Colonist recommended that 'lovers of the fine arts pay a visit to Dr. F's rooms in Hunter Street, and they will have the pleasure of ... recognising the likenesses which are in various stages of execution in [his] exhibition.' His talents as an artist being 'highly appreciated', Felton created portraits of a number of Sydney identities between this time and his unexpected and unexplained death, aged 40, in March 1842. Among the sitters depicted by Felton are Spark's wife, Frances Maria; pastoralist John Marquett Blaxland, his mother Harriott and sister, Anna Elizabeth Walker; Sophia O'Brien, the wife of newspaper proprietor; and Felton's friend and fellow artist, Conrad Martens. Felton's works are held in a select number of collections including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, National Gallery of Australia and the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales."

                            "Matthew Flinders (1774â€“1814), was one of the worldâ€™s most accomplished navigators. Born in England, Flinders entered the navy at age 15, served with Captain Bligh, and at age 20 sailed for Australia with surgeon George Bass. From 1798 to 1803 he made detailed surveys of Australiaâ€™s coastline and islands, enduring unsuitable, leaking and rotting vessels. The first person to circumnavigate Australia, he inspired and repaid loyalty amongst his comrades, and was sympathetic to the cultures of Indigenous Australians. In December 1803, during a trip back to England, Flinders was forced to take port in Mauritius due to the unfitness for service of his schooner. Here he was detained, unshackled, until 1810, because governor General De Caen, a supporter of Napoleon, suspected him of being an English spy. Having returned to England at last, Flinders saw the publication of his findings under the title _A Voyage to Terra Australis_ on 18 July 1814. The following day, he died. His grave, the whereabouts of which was long a mystery, was discovered beneath Euston Station, London, in January 2019 during archaeological surveys pending construction of a high-speed railway."

It is a general and benumbing course of misery that I undergo in this imprisonment, but by dwelling on thy most charming letters, every little of thy tender anxiety and distress, is afresh called up in vivid colouring to my maddened imagination. I am, as it were, shut up in a cask that has been rolled with violence from the top of hope down in the vale of misfortune; I am bruised and well-nigh stunned out of my senses; but cannot thou imagine the addition it would be to this misery for the cask to have been drawn full of spike nails; - such is the increase of misery to my feelings on thinking intensely of thee.\\n\\nI have many friends, but yet before thee they disappear as stars before the rays of a morning sun. I cannot connect the idea of happiness with anything but thee. Without thee, the world would be a blank. I might indeed receive some gratification from distinction and applause of society; but where could be the faithful friend who would enjoy and share this with me â€“ into whose bosom my full heart could unburthen [sic] itself of excess of joy. Where would be that sweet intercourse of soul, that fine seasoning of happiness, without which a degree of insipidity attends all our enjoyments? From thee, my beloved, and thee only it is that I look to receive this zest for life, this height of luxury.\\n\\nI love thee most tenderly. Heaven grant that neither ambition, or necessity may ever again divide us.",

                            "Johann Reinhold Forster (1729-1798), German/Scottish naturalist and writer, began his career as a pastor near Danzig. After a spell in Russia, he moved to England in 1766, teaching languages and natural history for a short time before producing A Catalogue of British Insects (1770). This and other publications brought him to the notice of Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1772. That year, aged forty-two, he was appointed naturalist on Cook's second voyage of discovery, on the Resolution; his son, Georg(e), accompanied him."

                            "Johann Georg(e) Forster (1754-1794), writer, made his first voyage of exploration - to Russia - with his father when he was eleven. A linguistic prodigy, he travelled on the Resolution as his father's assistant. His elegantly-written scientific account of the voyage was a bestseller, and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In Europe from 1778, he taught at various universities and continued to travel and publish; the German translation of his account of the Resolution voyage, Reise um die Welt, was published in 1778 and significantly influenced contemporary German scientific and intellectual currents. In the early 1790s he became entangled in French revolutionary affairs, alienating his wife and friends; branded a traitor, he died alone in Paris, predeceasing his father without having realised his dream of producing an encyclopaedic account of the South Seas."

                            "Kristian Fredrikson (1940â€“2005) was a designer for opera, drama, ballet, film and television. Born in New Zealand, Fredriksonâ€™s training as an artist began with classes at the Wellington Polytechnic College, which he undertook while working as a journalist and reviewer. In the early 1960s, having completed a theatre design apprenticeship, he moved to Australia and assisted with the design for the Australian Balletâ€™s _Auroraâ€™s Wedding_ (1964). Resident designer for the Melbourne Theatre Company from 1966 to 1974, he designed a great number of productions for the Australian Ballet, the Australian Opera, the Western Australian Opera, the South Australian Opera and the Sydney Theatre and Sydney Dance Companies. From 1975 onwards, Fredrikson collaborated regularly with Graeme Murphy, working with him on many productions including _Body of Work_ for the Sydney Dance Company and _Tivoli_, a co-production with the Australian Ballet. His numerous awards include three Helpmann Awards and an Australian Dance Award for services to dance (1999). The Arts Centre Melbourne presented a retrospective exhibition of his work in 1995, and in 2008 the _Kristian Fredrikson Scholarship for Design in the Performing Arts_ was established in his memory."

                            "Ivan Gaal came to Australia as a refugee from his native Hungary in 1957. Settling in Melbourne, he became involved with photography and filmmaking, working with the ABC and training as a teacher. In the early days of the alternative theatre group the Pram Factory, he recorded productions and took portraits of actors and other performers including dancers at work at Margaret Lasicaâ€™s Modern Dance Ensemble. Applause Please and the widely-distributed Soft Soap, two of his early short films, featured Max Gillies; Camberwell Junction (1975) became something of a cult classic on the Melbourne and Sydney independent film scenes. While Gaal was a key figure in the Melbourne Filmmakersâ€™ Cooperative, having graduated from the Swinburne Film School in 1978 he worked at the Victorian Department of Education, directing many short films and documentaries including Tandberg on page 1 and Ibrahim (1983-1984), the latter exploring the experience of a teenaged refugee from Lebanon. Gaal was a finalist in the National Photographic Portrait Prizes of 2013 and 2015. Thirteen of his short films are held by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne. His work is favourably re-evaluated by prolific and esteemed film theorist Adrian Martin in â€˜Comment, think, analyse, experience and learn: The neglected film work of Ivan Gaalâ€™, Metro 2013.\\n\\nIvan Gaal believes his photograph of his friend George Spartels helped the actor win roles early in his career."

                            "Marea Gazzard AM (1928â€“2013), ceramic artist, trained at the East Sydney Technical College and London Central School for Arts and Craft. Emerging as one of England's leading ceramicists in the 1950s, she returned with her husband to Australia in 1960; together they set about building a modern house in Paddington, while starting the first urban action group in Sydney to help save the area. Unlike other ceramicists at the time, Gazzard used hand-building techniques to create sculptural forms inspired by Cycladic sculpture and pre-Colombian pottery. In 1973, with fibre artist Mona Hessing, Gazzard was one of the first craftspeople invited to exhibit at the National Gallery of Victoria. The exhibition, _Clay + Fibre_, generated much discussion about whether craft was art and accelerated acceptance of women artists. Through the 1970s and 1980s she exhibited large abstract works in a number of important group shows as well as solo exhibitions. Gazzard was also instrumental in the development of craft in Australia, including helping to set up the Crafts Council of Australia in 1971 and chairing the Crafts Board of the Australia Council in 1973. President of the World Crafts Council from 1980 to 1984, Gazzard was commissioned to create the bronze sculpture _Mingarri: The Little Olgas_ (1988), which stands in the central Executive Courtyard of Parliament House, Canberra. A major retrospective of her work was held at the SH Ervin Gallery in 1994, accompanied by a book by Christine France, _Marea Gazzard: Form and Clay_. Gazzard's _Bindu_ (2004) was commissioned for the Athens Olympic Games. The Art Gallery of New South Wales acquired her last major work, _Selini I_ (2009), in 2012."

                            "I think the thing that really concerns me is form. Sometimes Iâ€™m asked where I get my ideas from and itâ€™s hard to say, sometimes it might be sitting in a movie, just a certain shape flicks across the screen and I think â€˜Thatâ€™s just what Iâ€™m looking forâ€™, or on a beach a piece of driftwood, or in the park a squashed fig. Anything can supply it when youâ€™re looking, when youâ€™re feeling the need for a new idea.\\n\\nIâ€™d say that the curve is the thing that interests me, seldom the straight line in an object. Iâ€™m very sensitive to curves, a wrong curve can ruin it from the first half-inch. If I know itâ€™s somehow not going to be right, I just break it up. I break up a lot of things; in fact in my studio at the moment I can see six or eight things that I will no doubt smash up. Perhaps itâ€™s the scale thatâ€™s important in what I do. I keep being dissatisfied with small things, though they can be fun to do at times. I want to do bigger, more massive objects.\\n\\nI never feel so happy as when Iâ€™m quietly working alone. And I have everything here to make my work, the kiln, all. An artist has to be very close to his work. I know when Iâ€™ve been looking in museums, Iâ€™ve often felt that Iâ€™ve known the person whoâ€™s made that object. Perhaps this doing of oneâ€™s own work, oneâ€™s own thing, perhaps this is the link between civilisations. Other civilisations have tried to leave us what they knew. Perhaps this is what itâ€™s about.",

                            "Photographer and social justice activist Juno Gemes (b. 1944) has spent much of her long career documenting the lives and struggles of First Nations people. Born in Budapest, Gemes moved to Australia with her family in 1949. She studied at Sydney University, worked in theatre and wrote for the _International Times_ in London on and off until 1971. In the 1970s she became involved in the Yellow House at Potts Point, Sydney and worked in Central Australia on the film _Uluru_ (1978). She held her first solo exhibition, _We Wait No More_, in 1982; the same year she exhibited photographs in the group shows _After the Tent Embassy_ and _Apmira: Artists for Aboriginal Land Rights_. In 1984 she set up the Camera Future Photographers Cooperative Studio in Kings Cross and became a member of the Australian Journalists' Association Freelance committee. Two years later she established Paper Bark Press (1986â€“2010) with her partner, poet Robert Adamson; they live on the Hawkesbury River where she has a photography studio. Her 1997 series _The Language of Oysters_ documents the lives of oyster farmers on the Hawkesbury, raising questions of sustainability. In 2003 the National Portrait Gallery exhibited her portraits of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reconciliation activists and personalities, _Proof: Portraits from the Movement 1978â€“2003_, and has since acquired many of her photographs. Gemes was one of ten photographers invited to document that National Apology in Canberra in 2008. The Macquarie University Art Gallery held a survey exhibition of her work, _The Quiet Activist: Juno Gemes_, in 2019."

                            "Sir Kenneth Gillespie (1929â€“2010), dancer, teacher and founder of the Tasmanian Ballet, left his native Launceston at age sixteen to join the Borovansky Ballet in Melbourne. Soon a lead dancer, he performed with the Royal Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, the New York City Ballet and the American Festival Ballet before returning to Launceston in 1960. There he created Tasmania's first ballet studio, built behind his house in Wellington Street. He ran the Tasmanian Ballet School for many years, from which the performing ensemble known as the Tasmanian Ballet was founded in 1961. Gillespie travelled around Tasmania to give classes. His students included not only Graeme Murphy, who credits him as his mentor, but also Michelle Hawkins, Natasha Middleton, Claire McHugh and Glenn Murray. The Tasmanian Ballet performed and toured around Australia regularly, including in many primary schools, with Gillespie involved in every aspect of all its productions from 1961. By 1975 it was a state and federally funded professional company. Gillespie was its director until he retired in 1979 and moved to Newcastle for the climate. He received a knighthood from the Order of St John of Malta and of Rhodes in 1989."

                            "James Gillray, caricaturist and printmaker, was born in Chelsea and learned the art of engraving as a youth in London. After a period with a troupe of strolling players, he began to study at the Royal Academy, paying his way by engraving. He published his first known caricature in 1779. About ten years later, he formed a permanent professional partnership with Hannah Humphrey, publisher and printseller; they were to work together and share accommodation for twenty years. He not only sold his prints through her shop, which prospered accordingly, but depicted her shop (which moved from Old Bond Street, to New Bond Street, to St James Street) in his prints. Many of Gillrayâ€™s cruellest satires were directed at George III and his family. Early in his career he treated Whigs worse than Tories overall (because Tories, being more affluent, were more likely to buy his works), but from 1801 onwards he attacked both sides with equal vigour. Any study of eighteenth-century English life, costume, the Court or politics must turn, at some point, to the works of Gillray, in which the inscriptions constitute a vital complement to the images. Having lost his sight, and having attempted suicide by leaping from the upper window of the print shop, he lapsed into continuous insanity in 1811, to be cared-for by Miss Humphrey until he died in 1815. The Tate Britain mounted a major exhibition of his meticulously hand-coloured works, occupying â€˜a kind of limbo between political history and art historyâ€™, in 2001."

                            "Peter Goldsworthy AM (b. 1951), medical doctor and writer, was born in Minlaton, South Australia, and grew up in various country towns as his father, a school teacher, moved for work. Goldsworthy studied medicine at the University of Adelaide, and after graduating in 1974 worked in drug and alcohol rehabilitation while starting to write. His first book of poetry, _Readings from Ecclesiastes_, won the Commonwealth Poetry Prize for a debut collection, the South Australian Premierâ€™s Award, and was joint winner of the Fellowship of Australian Writersâ€™ Anne Elder Poetry Award in 1982. His first book of short stories, _Bleak Rooms_, was published in 1988 and his debut novel, _Maestro_, appeared the following year. Shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award, _Maestro_ was adapted for the stage in a collaboration between Goldsworthy and his daughter Anna, a concert pianist. Subsequent works include the novels _Honk If You Are Jesus_ (1992), _Wish_ (1995) and _Three Dog Night_ (2003), which won the FAW Christina Stead Award, and _Everything I Knew_ (2008), which was shortlisted for the Prime Ministerâ€™s Literature Award. His works have been translated widely, and four have been adapted for the stage, as has the short story _The Kiss_. Also an essayist and screenwriter, Goldsworthy wrote the libretti for Richard Millsâ€™ operas _Summer of the Seventeenth Doll_ and _Batavia_, the latter winning him and Mills the 2002 Helpmann Award for the best new Australian work, and a Green Room Award for special creative achievement. His most recent collection of short stories, _Gravel_ (2010), was shortlisted for the ASAL Gold Medal. His _Stupid Boyhood: a Memoir_ was published in 2013. The stage adaptation of _Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam_ (1993) is taking place in 2018. _The Minotaur_, his first novel in a decade, and an opera based on the lives of Ned and Ellen Kelly (written with the composer Luke Styles), are appearing in 2019."

As his father was a saw miller who worked all over central NSW, he attended at least twelve different primary schools before his family moved to Canberra. After he finished school he got a job at the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies; while working there he met Marcia Langton, who encouraged him to go to university. Educated at the University of New South Wales and subsequently at the Australian National University, he worked for The Canberra Times as a copy boy before gaining a cadetship at the Macquarie Radio Network. He then became a political correspondent for the ABC, and has since reported on Australian and international news and political affairs for Channel Seven, CNN International, Sky News Australia and SBS, working in London, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Abu Dhabi. He returned to Sydney in 2012 to help launch SBS's NITV. Grant later joined the ABC as the editor of Indigenous Affairs and became Professor of Global Affairs at Griffith University. In 2019, he moved to Doha, Qatar to work with Al Jazeera. Appointed the Vice-Chancellor's Chair of Indigenous Belonging at Charles Sturt University in 2020, he returned to the ABC as International Affairs Analyst. For his journalism and media work Grant has been awarded three Walkleys, a Peabody award and a DuPont award. He has published numerous books including his family memoir _The Tears of Strangers; Talking to My Country_; _Australia Day_; _On Identity_, published in English and Wiradjuri; _Tell it to the World: An Indigenous Memoir_; and _With the Falling of the Dusk_. Grant wrote _The Australian Dream_ (2019), a feature documentary film about the football player Adam Goodes exploring racism, identity and belonging."

He painted Samuel Beckett, and his portrait of Bacon is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. He held his first one-man exhibition at the Abbott and Holder Gallery in London in 1960. After moving to Paris in the 1960s he painted many private and well-known subjects including Juliette Binoche, Helena Bonham Carter, Yves Saint Laurent and the Prince of Brunei. Director Kerry Franzman made a film on the life of Gray, _Portrait of a Portrait Artist_, that was shown at the New York Film Festival in 2001."

                            "Robert Hannaford AM (b. 1944), a largely self-taught artist, grew up on his family farm near the small South Australian town of Riverton before working as political cartoonist for the _Adelaide Adverti_ser from 1964 to 1967. In 1969 he won the inaugural AME Bale Scholarship. He took up painting full-time in 1970 with the encouragement of the veteran South Australian portraitist, Sir Ivor Hele. He has been a favourite in both the Archibald Prize â€“ in which he has been a finalist 26 times, and won the People's Choice Award three times â€“ and the Doug Moran Portrait Prize, which he won in 1990. Much in demand as an official portraitist, he painted the Historic Memorials Committee's official prime-ministerial portrait of Paul Keating and the official Centenary of Federation painting that now hangs in Parliament House alongside Tom Roberts' 'Big Picture'. In 2015 the Art Gallery of South Australia showed more than 200 of his works in the solo exhibition _Robert Hannaford_. Hannaford works in a studio in Riverton, where has painted hundreds of portraits, his easel placed beneath a skylight that enables him to exploit the full range of daylight. Enjoying the discipline imposed by a commission, he is open to ideas from his sitters about how they would like to be portrayed, finding that they often lead him into new ways of seeing and composing. 'I can find anything interesting,' he says. 'I could look at the corner of the room and find a painting that could keep me going for ages.' The National Portrait Gallery owns his portraits of Dame Joan Sutherland, Robert Dessaix, Alexander Ramsay, Tim Flannery and Lowitja O'Donoghue, the latter painted on commission."

She later studied art history there, but as a practitioner she is largely self-taught, and has undertaken short courses in painting, life drawing and anatomy at the Adelaide Central School of Art; the Grand Central Atelier and the Art Students League, New York; and at Studio Escalier, France. Also mentored by her father â€“ the distinguished portraitist Robert Hannaford AM â€“ Hannaford has been selected for the Archibald Prize every year since 2015 and has been a finalist for the Portia Geach Memorial Award and the Doug Moran Portrait Prize on multiple occasions. Specialising in portraiture and still life, Hannaford says that, whatever her subject matter, she endeavours to capture 'a certain quietness and stillness'. She has been awarded fellowships and residencies in Australia and overseas and has undertaken official portrait commissions for many clients including Melbourne Girls' Grammar, the Supreme Court of South Australia, the City of Adelaide, and the Government of New South Wales."

                            "Nicholas Harding (1956â€“2022) was one of Australia's most highly regarded artists, known for his portraits and drawings, and his light-filled, vigorously painted images of the bush and the coast. Born in London, he came to Australia with his family as a boy and attained a Bachelor of Arts in 1975. After a couple of years travelling in Europe and the UK, he trained as an animator with the cartoon company Hanna Barbera, and then worked as a freelance animator for over twenty years. Meanwhile, he taught himself to paint and was first exhibited in the Sulman Prize in 1980. He held his first solo exhibition with Rex Irwin Art Dealer, Sydney, in 1992, subsequently showing multiple times with Irwin over the next twenty years and exhibiting also with Philip Bacon Galleries, Brisbane and Sophie Gannon Gallery, Melbourne. Harding became known early on for huge pen and ink depictions of the railway tracks and shabby streets of inner Sydney, and the scrubby trees of the beaches of the north coast of New South Wales. His paintings on the same themes, as well as flowers, and beach and river scenes, became much sought-after by collectors. He won the Mosman Art Prize in 1993 and from that year onward featured regularly in the Archibald Prize, the Wynne Prize, the Dobell Drawing Prize, the Sulman Prize and the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize. In 2001, the first of several triumphant years, Harding won the Dobell Prize and triumphed in the Archibald with his _Portrait of John Bell as King Lear_. A major retrospective of his work, _Nicholas Harding: Drawn to Paint_, was exhibited at the SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney in 2010; and the Tweed Regional Gallery presented _Carving Light and Landscape_ in 2015. In 2017 the National Portrait Gallery presented _Nicholas Harding: 28 Portraits_, which encompassed everything from swiftly-executed portraits of anonymous sitters that Harding sketched mid-flight on airline sick bags, to lush, large scale paintings of sitters including writer Robert Drewe and actor Hugo Weaving â€“ both of which are held in the NPGâ€™s collection. \\n\\nHarding held residencies at the CitÃ© des Arts Internationales in Paris (2013) and at Bundanon, New South Wales (1998). His work is represented in private, corporate and public collections internationally and at home, including those of the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Art Gallery of South Australia and the National Portrait Gallery."

                            "Kathleen 'Kate' Hattam (1923â€“2004), stylesetter and art collector, was born in London and served with the Womenâ€™s Royal Air Force during the Second World War, stationed in radar at Beachey Head. She met her future husband Hal Hattam, a Scottish-born Australian obstetrician and artist, while he was in England with the Australian Imperial Force. She started her career in the advertising department of Harrods before returning with Hal to Melbourne, where she found marketing work with Georges, then the city's most fashionable department store. Balancing work with raising her first three children, she quickly rose to the position of advertising manager, where she was at one time said to be the highest-paid woman in Australia. The couple became friends with a group of inner-city intellectuals and aesthetes, and entertained and encouraged many emerging artists who have since become household names. At Kate's behest, artists such as John Perceval, Arthur Boyd and Leonard French designed wrapping paper and greeting cards for Georges, and she is believed to have been influential in securing fair rates of payment for artists engaged in commercial work. The Hattam family homes in Canterbury and South Yarra housed an unrivalled body of works by artists in their circle and beyond, including John Brack, Clifton Pugh, Fred Williams and Sid Nolan, who came to play a substantial role in Australian art in the twentieth century."

Inspired by an imaginary world, and sometimes described as 'luminist', her paintings often include incorporeal, surrealistic motifs in empty landscapes and express a sense of transience. She has exhibited throughout Australia and abroad, including the Frankfurt Contemporary Art Fair in 1993, _Contempora 5_ in 1999, _Uncommon World: Aspects of Contemporary Australian Art_ in 2000 and _Big Spooks_ in 2005. A major survey of her works from 1990-2016 was shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney in 2016. She has won numerous awards and prizes, including the 2014 Doug Moran National Portrait Prize for a portrait of her long-term partner, artist Bill Henson, and the 2016 Archibald Prize for a portrait of Barry Humphries. Hearman's works are held in public and private collections throughout Australia."

                            "Sir Ivor Hele (1912â€“1993) was born in Adelaide and studied art at Prince Alfred College and the South Australian School of Arts and, later, in Paris and Munich. He was Australia's longest-serving official war artist, serving in North Africa, the Middle East and New Guinea during the Second World War and in the Korean War. The Australian War Memorial holds the majority of his works, including intimate landscapes, massive battle-pieces and sensitive drawings in chalk. His postwar paintings were occasionally shown at the _Adelaide_ _Advertiser's_ open-air art exhibitions. Although Hele painted landscapes (mostly of the rocky southern coast of South Australia) and made thousands of erotic paintings and drawings, he was best known as a portrait painter. He was much in demand as an official portraitist and won the Archibald Prize five times between 1951 and 1957, notably with his portrait of Sir Robert Menzies in 1954 and a self-portrait in 1957. Despite his success, he rarely exhibited his works and his last solo exhibition was at the 1970 Adelaide Festival of the Arts. Hele is represented in the National Portrait Gallery's collection with his portraits of Dame Nancy Buttfield, Sir Lloyd Dumas and Claude Charlick."

                            "Sir Robert Helpmann CBE (1909â€“1986) was a dancer, actor and choreographer. The son of a sheep farmer and a frustrated actress, Helpmann grew up in Mount Gambier, South Australia. At the age of eleven he made his stage debut, dressed in a tutu, at a charity concert in front of Dame Nellie Melba. Soon after he joined Anna Pavlova's touring company and went to England where by 1934 he was lead male dancer at the Vic-Wells Ballet (later Sadler's Wells). There, he formed a celebrated partnership with Dame Margot Fonteyn. Renowned for his dramatic and innovative ballet choreography, Helpmann was co-director and then director of The Australian Ballet from 1965 to 1976; during this period, in 1965, he was Australian of the Year. He appeared in twelve films, including _The Red Shoes_, which he also choreographed. Renowned for flamboyance and wit, at the age of 60 he performed as Dr CoppÃ©lius in The Australian Ballet's _CoppÃ©lia_ and he was still dancing two months before his death in the role of the Red King in _Checkmate_."

                            "By this time the English ballet was growing in impetus and the houses were getting bigger and I was getting more than favourable press and Markova and I had formed a great partnership. Markova then decided to leave and start her own company with Anton Dolin. And I thought, â€˜Well this is the end of the balletâ€™, when Ninette de Valois said, â€˜Iâ€™ve found a girl that youâ€™re going to dance withâ€™, and took me into the classroom and I said, â€˜Which one?â€™ She said, â€˜That one over there with the two long plaitsâ€™, and I thought, â€˜That funny-looking little girl?â€™ and I said, â€˜Whatâ€™s her name?â€™ and she said, â€˜Peggy Hookhamâ€™, and I said, â€˜Well, thatâ€™s not going to look very good on the notice board is it, Peggy Hookham?â€™ And I said, â€˜She looks Chineseâ€™. And she said, â€˜Well as a matter of fact, she was born in Shanghai but she is English. No, she was born in Reigate and she went to Shanghai as a little girl â€“ I want you to work with herâ€™. And the minute, of course, I saw her dance, I realised that she was absolutely wonderful, and Ninette said, â€˜Sheâ€™s going to change her name, sheâ€™s going to call herself Margot Fonteynâ€™. And so from that moment on, I danced with Fonteyn for 27 years and I suppose we became, at that time, the most famous pair dancing in Europe.\\n\\nIâ€™m always asked what was the most memorable performance or production, and itâ€™s impossible really for me to say, because so many things have been memorable to me. My first appearances with Markova, my first appearances with Fonteyn, my first appearances with Vivienne Leigh, the first time I played _Hamlet_, all of them. I have never felt for one minute in my life, â€˜Iâ€™m a successâ€™. I feel Iâ€™ve accomplished something and that is done and therefore there is something more to do. The success or failure of what has passed has passed and I must go on to something else. And whatever else I may have achieved in life, I hope that people will remember that my whole life has been dedicated to producing something of beauty in the theatre.",

During her lifetime Hester's contribution was overshadowed by her male contemporaries, however her work is now widely acknowledged. She is best known for her drawings, characterised by intense imagery and ability to economically convey states of mind and emotions. Hester's life was beset by tragedy. Diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease at the age of 27, she left Tucker for fellow artist, Gray Smith, and gave her son, Sweeney, to friends John and Sunday Reed for adoption. Despite a bleak prognosis, Hester continued to work until her death in 1960."

                            "Born in Lincolnshire, Charles Hewitt (1837â€“1912) had begun working in Melbourne by 1860 and was one of the founding members of the Photographic Society of Victoria. Initially he was in business with Charles Nettleton in a studio on Bourke Street East, but he was working independently by 1866. Examples of his work were included in the Melbourne Intercolonial Exhibition that year, and he was awarded an honourable mention for his 'fancy dress portraits'. Around 1866 or 1867, Hewitt opened his own studio â€“ The Australasian Studio â€“ at 95 Swanston Street, but he declared insolvency in 1878, citing 'falling-off in business, illness in family, and having to pay heavy interest on borrowed money' as the cause of the studio's collapse. He later had a studio in South Melbourne, and in 1892 he moved to Stawell, where he died in 1912. His known works include a suite of carte de visite portraits of members of the first Australian sporting team to tour overseas â€“ the Indigenous cricketers who travelled to England in 1868 â€“ and photographic reproductions of equestrian portraits by Frederick Woodhouse and Thomas Lyttleton, which illustrated the 1871 edition of the _Victorian Stud-Book_."

From 1926 to 1930 she studied at the School of Fine Arts in Adelaide under F Millward Grey. In 1930 her work was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of South Australia. Her first solo exhibition was held in Sydney three years later. In 1934 she travelled to London with her family, and remained in Europe until 1937 studying and painting. When she returned to Australia she returned briefly to Adelaide and before moving to Sydney, where she lived for the rest of her life. In 1938 she became the first woman to win the Archibald Prize, and in late 1943 she became the first woman to be appointed as an Australian war artist. Commissioned to depict the womenâ€™s war effort in the air force, the navy and the army, she completed more than 170 works of art before being discharged from service in New Guinea in 1946. While in New Guinea she met a doctor, Robert Black, whom she later married. Following her discharge from war service she went to London, returning to Sydney in 1948. She continued to paint, exhibit and travel with her husband. Her works are held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, the Australian War Memorial, the National Library of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery and several state galleries."

Iâ€™d arranged myself a beautiful native bowl full of flowers and I was sitting in the mess, painting this, when I had a signal to be moved on down to Lae, and I ignored the signal, and the jeep came along to collect me to take me to the airport, and I said, â€˜Go away, Iâ€™m in the middle of painting flowersâ€™, and I continued with my flowers and got into hot water over this. The signals flew from New Guinea to Melbourne and back, and I was still painting my flowers, refusing to budge.\\n\\nI recall that picture and sticking it out, and I remember painting it on the mess table; I had to move every time a meal was brought forward, and it took me about four or five days to complete it, and Iâ€™ve kept that canvas, I called it _The Flower Sip_ and itâ€™s one picture that didnâ€™t go into the Military History Section.

                            "Noel Fraser Hickey (1921â€“2010) was born in Kensington, in Sydney, New South Wales, a stone's throw from the Royal Randwick Racecourse. His father, James Hickey, was a violinist, as was his elder brother, Lionel. The family later lived at The Rocks and Noel was educated at Fort Street Boys' School in Petersham. As a schoolboy, he got into the habit of making his way back to Randwick racecourse where he would watch Phar Lap train, sometimes convincing a sympathetic tram conductor to let him catch a ride from Circular Quay for free. He got to know some of the trainers, who let him ride their horses so that he could get a better look at the champion. Hickey got to know Phar Lap's strapper, Tommy Woodcock, too. On race days, he would scramble under a fence in a far corner of the course to watch Phar Lap race. After leaving school, Hickey found work as a photographer with Kodak. He served with the AIF in North Africa and New Guinea in the Second World War.  \\n\\n\\nBy the time he was repatriated to Sydney on medical grounds, Hickey's devotion to Phar Lap was commonly known. He laid a wreath at the entrance to Randwick Racecourse each year on the anniversary of the famed gelding's death, and in 1944 he raised Â£1 from other troops and sent the money back to the _Daily Telegraph_ so that a wreath could be laid on his behalf. Hickey later told a journalist that 'I got into some tight spots in the war. It was the memory of Phar Lap that got me through.' He married for the first time in 1946; he had met his wife, Edna, when she was working as a photographic processor, and they had three children. By the 1950s Hickey appears to have had his own studio, specialising in headshots and portfolio photography for aspiring models from schools such as that run by the former Miss Australia, Pat Woodley (who is also represented in Nancy Menetrey's portrait of Noel Fraser Hickey). Hickey remarried after his divorce from Edna in 1970 and had another son with his second wife, Maree. When that marriage ended, he moved to Western Australia, where he trained racehorses.\\n\\nHickey nevertheless maintained his habit of honouring the anniversary of Phar Lap's death every year; and in 1982 having returned to Sydney, he went so far as to make a new headstone for the horse when the original one went missing. (The original headstone had been donated to the Australian Jockey Club in the 1970s). Hickey lived in Coffs Harbour towards the end of his life, and always arranged for a wreath to be laid when he was unable to lay one himself."

While earning a living as a commercial photographer, she maintained a private focus on her art photography, and entered various art prizes and exhibitions. In 2003, she won both the Fisher's Ghost Art Award for Contemporary Art in Campbelltown, and the Josephine Ulrick Photography Award for Portraiture in Tweed Heads. Since then, she has been making series of photographs of individuals that strain the definition of portraiture, finding, it has been said, 'beauty in perceived imperfections and render[ing] idealised beauty strange'. She had her first exhibition with Sydneyâ€™s inner-city Stills Gallery in 2005, and the following year the National Portrait Gallery included a series of her immaculate, unsettling photographs in the exhibition _Truth and Likeness_. In 2016 she completed a Master of Fine Arts at the Sydney College of the Arts, where she investigated the connection between humans and animals. Over her career Hicks has been represented in many solo and group exhibitions and her works are included in Australian and international collections. The National Gallery of Victoria held a major exhibition of her work _Petrina Hicks: Bleached Gothic_ in 2019â€“2020."

                            "Tracey Holmes (b. 1966), sports broadcaster and journalist, has covered twelve Olympic Games and was the first woman to host an Australian national sports program, Grandstand. Born in Sydney to a surfing family, Holmes' parents took her to South Africa when she was three, where they lived for four years. They then lived in Hawaii. She began her career in 1989 with a sports broadcasting cadetship at the ABC Radio, where she hosted Grandstand in the early 1990s. Her job as a media spokesperson for the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games led to a role as co-host of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. This was followed by a position as a sports presenter with Channel Seven, in which role she was the network's face of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Later that year she moved overseas with partner Stan Grant and worked as a sports presenter and broadcaster in Hong Kong and Beijing for China Central TV News, an English language news channel. Returning to Australia in 2006, Holmes was re-appointed as the host for Grandstand. In 2009, Holmes worked for CNN in Abu Dhabi, covering social issues, business and sports in the Middle East; two years later she rejoined China Central TV News in Beijing as an anchor. After moving back to Australia with her family in 2014, Holmes returned to the ABC hosting various radio programs including the award-winning sports program and podcast _The Ticket_. Twice named as a finalist in the Walkley awards, Holmes is a published author, lectures in journalism at the University of Technology, Sydney, and is a senior mentor for the International Olympic Committee's Young Reporters program."

                            "Cherry Hood (b. c. 1950), is an artist well known for her haunting, large-scale images of faces. Working for preference in watercolour, which she allows to bleed and drip, Hood specialises in intense depictions of mostly anonymous subjects. With a studio based in the Southern Tablelands of NSW, she has embraced her landscape surrounds, sometimes incorporating it into her figurative works. In 2000, Hood gained her masters degree from Sydney College of the Arts with a thesis comprising an investigation of 'gender politics and cultural mores and taboos surrounding the representation of the male body'. The following year she held her first solo exhibition at Mori Gallery, Sydney. Since then, she has exhibited in solo and group shows in Australia and internationally, including in the National Portrait Gallery's _Contemporary Australian Portraits_ in 2002. Following her Archibald Prize win in 2002 for her portrait, _Simon Tedeschi unplugged_, she won the Kedumba Drawing Award in 2003. Amongst her portrait subjects are painters Matthys Gerber, Ben Quilty and Michael Zavros, and pianist David Helfgott. Her portrait of Tedeschi is one of a number of Archibald winners in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Hood's works are in state collections around Australia and in public and private collections around the world."

                            "Robert Hughes AO (1938-2012) was the senior art critic for Time magazine and one of Australiaâ€™s famous expatriates of the 1960s. Born in Sydney, Hughes was educated at Riverview and Sydney University, although he did not complete a degree. Like many of the figures who floated around the Sydney â€˜Pushâ€™ in the late 1950s, he began his career contributing poems, cartoons, criticism and articles to _Honi Soit_, the _Observer_, and _Nation_. He began working for _Time_ in 1970, the year his _The Art of Australia_ was published, and lived in the USA for the rest of his life. His books and television series include _The Shock of the New_ (1980), _The Fatal Shore_ (1987), _Nothing if Not Critical_ (1990), _American Visions_ (1997) and _A Jerk on One End_ (1999), the latter about fishing. In 1999, just after beginning to film his television series on Australia, _Beyond the Fatal Shore_, Hughes suffered a terrible car accident on the coast of Western Australia. The series was cobbled together during his agonising convalescence, and Hughes had little control over the final cut; it was hostilely reviewed. The accident led to a protracted legal process; three years later, there was still talk of extraditing Hughes from the USA to face charges. His second marriage broke down, and his only son died. Named the _London Sunday Times_ Writer of the Year in 2000, Hughes proceeded to write _Goya_ (2003) and a superb autobiography, _Things I Didnâ€™t Know_ (2006)."

                            "Graeme Inson (1923â€“2000), artist and teacher, was born in Cootamundra, New South Wales and educated at Canberra Grammar School. He studied art in Melbourne with Max Meldrum in the early 1940s and also worked for Meldrum as an assistant teacher, becoming a leading exponent of his mentor's theory of perception and the importance of tonal and space relations between objects. After Meldrum's death, Inson moved to Sydney and established a studio in Rowe Street. He held his first solo exhibition in 1954 and in 1955 he opened his own art school. One of the most successful 'Meldrumites', he painted landscapes and still life as well as portraits, travelling widely to paint and holding scores of solo exhibitions in Sydney into the 1990s. \\n\\nInson was commissioned for many official portraits and was twice a finalist in the Doug Moran prize. He entered 41 works in the Archibald Prize between 1952 and 1979. The National Portrait Gallery acquired his 1980 portrait of Gough Whitlam in 2002, his 1953 portrait of Brian Fitzpatrick in 2008; his 1951 portrait of Max Meldrum in 2009; and his portrait of Kevin Weldon in 2012. In 2014, the NPG acquired Inson's painting of his life partner, the artist Ivy Shore."

                            "Akira Isogawa (b. 1964), fashion designer, was born in Kyoto, Japan, and first came to Australia on a working holiday at the age of 21. Excited by what he saw as the country's 'fresh and youthful spirit,' he moved here permanently, working as a waiter by night while studying fashion design at East Sydney TAFE. In 1993 he opened the Akira Isogawa boutique in Woollahra, and swiftly established a reputation for his bold and intelligent clothes. At Sydney's Australian Fashion Week in 1996, he sent all his models out wearing red socks from Gowings because he couldn't afford shoes for them; but he has shown at most Australian Fashion Weeks since, and since 1998 he has shown twice annually in Paris. He has exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art and has featured in the Powerhouse Museum's Fashion of the Year retrospective. Object Gallery's exhibition of his construction techniques in Sydney is said to have been its most successful ever show. At 1999's Australian Fashion Industry Awards he was named Designer of the Year and Womenswear Designer of the Year. The National Gallery of Victoria's _Akira Isogawa: Printemps EtÃ©_ in 2004â€“2005 was the first solo exhibition of an Australian designer's work to be shown at a major art institution and later toured to Singapore, Manila, Bangkok, New Delhi and Mumbai. In 2005 Isogawa was depicted on the 'Australian Legends' series of stamps issued by Australia Post and in 2007 he was named the country's first Fashion Laureate. A regular collaborator with choreographer Graeme Murphy, he designed costumes for The Australian Ballet's _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Murphy_, and for the Sydney Dance Company productions of _Salome_, _Air and Other Invisible Forces_, _Ellipse_ and _Grand_. Also known for his unique textiles, Isogawa's designs have appeared on collections for Designer Rugs and Woven Images. Sydney's Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences showed the retrospective _Akira Isogawa_ in 2018â€“2019 and his work was included in the Victoria and Albert Museum's 2020 exhibition _Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk_ in London."

                            "When I look back, being a teenager growing up in a traditional city in Japan called Kyoto, I felt I was a bit of a fashion victim, really. Well now actually I create fashion. But back then, actually, I was consuming fashion and that's how much I loved [it].  \\nJapanese culture is so different from Western ones. My grandparents had a house next door. They were all wearing actually traditional clothes â€“ kimono. What I noticed about kimono is actually they're made out rectangular shaped cloth. And they have no shapes. Whereas actually, Western clothes has a particular shape that enhance, particularly actually for female, the femininity of female body, but whereas actually kimono is totally unisex. I mean, I've never actually designed kimono myself. But being a kimono designer, I imagine actually, they work on texture, colour, print, and so on, because it's a highly textile driven fashion, and then to me, that's what Japanese fashion is all about. You know, when I design my own collection, I never really force myself to express my Japanese entity, but I feel that it just comes up naturally. And I think what's interesting is that not just, you know, designing something so traditionally Japanese, but then I kind of actually manage to fuse with Australian ease I guess actually. Australia has got this particular attitude â€“ friendly to start with â€“ but it's quite actually casual about things, you know. I feel actually my design is a result of actually, you know, some Japanese heritage with Australian attitude, which is actually friendly and easy.",

                            "Alex Jelinek (1925â€“2007), architect and designer, graduated from the technical building school of Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ©, near Prague, during World War II. In 1946 he became attached to the architectural school of the Prague Academy of Fine Arts, but just weeks before he was due to graduate, he fled communist Czechoslovakia to live as a displaced person in West Germany. In 1950 he emigrated to Australia on a labour contract. Initially working in Melbourne, laying track, the cultivated Praguer ended up on the Eucumbene Dam site. Some time before 1955 he met the artist Lina Bryans, and they began a lifelong relationship. Prickly with prospective clients, Jelinek was a visionary of genius, drawing brilliant designs for far more structures than he ever realised. For Bryansâ€™s second cousin, Canberra academic Bruce Benjamin, he carried out the spiral â€˜Round Houseâ€™ in Gawler Crescent, Deakin, which was named Australian House of the Year in 1957 and is now heritage-listed. In 1962 he designed a roadhouse at Peregian Beach that was converted to a motel before it was knocked down in 2003. Otherwise, his modifications to Bryansâ€™s two Melbourne houses were his only solid architectural contributions. His huge sculpture, Quill (1974) and some aluminium furniture he designed are now in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria."

                            "Carol Jerrems (1949â€“1980) was a photographer known for her intimate portraits of friends, lovers and others occupying the progressive social and creative circles in which she moved. Jerrems grew up in suburban Melbourne and studied art and design under Paul Cox at the Prahran Technical School between 1967 and 1970. Having won a number of awards for her photographs, including an Institute of Australian Photographers Award in 1970, Jerrems trained as a teacher and worked at technical colleges in Melbourne and, later, Hobart. She began exhibiting in the early 1970s at venues such as Brummels Gallery, Melbourne; the National Gallery of Victoria; the Arts Council Gallery, Sydney; and, later, the Australian Centre for Photography. Works such as _Vale Street_ (1975) are considered emblematic of 1970s counter-culture in Australia, not only for their documentation of people involved in spheres such as activism and creativity but specifically for their evocation of the spirit and aspirations that informed the lives and pursuits of her sitters. During the 1970s, Jerrems also completed commissions for clients such as Macquarie University; was awarded grants by the Australia Council and the Australian Film Commission; and worked for a period as a yoga instructor at an ashram north of Sydney. In 1979, Jerrems became ill with Budd Chiari Syndrome, a rare liver disease, and spent several months in hospital in Hobart undergoing treatment. She died in Melbourne in February 1980, a few weeks short of her 31st birthday. The National Gallery of Australia held touring exhibitions _Living in the 70s: Photographs by Carol Jerrems_ in 1990â€“1991 and _Carol Jerrems: Photographic Artist_ in 2013â€“2014. Heide Museum of Modern Art staged _Up Close: Carol Jerrems with Larry Clark, Nan Goldin and William Yang_ in 2010."

                            "Louis Kahan (1905-2002) was born in Vienna, Austria to Jewish parents. After training as a tailor in Vienna, at twenty Kahan moved to Paris, where he worked for the couturier Paul Poiret, first as a tailor and then a designer. In 1939, he enlisted in the Foreign Legion; as the war progressed he worked for the American Red Cross, making thousands of glamorous portraits of wounded servicemen in French and American hospitals in North Africa. After the war he returned to Paris and worked as an illustrator for Le Figaro, but in 1947 he came to Australia. He settled in Melbourne in 1950. Soon after he arrived the editor of Meanjin, Clem Christesen, asked him to make a series of pen and ink portraits of writers for the journal. Critic Robert Nelson wrote that these portraits 'stand tall in the great tradition of intellectual homage: direct, well observed, economical, even brusque'. Over the next fifty years his pen and ink portraits were hung in many Melbourne homes, while he continued to experiment with techniques and fields of activity. The Jewish Museum held a Kahan retrospective in 1997, comprising portraits, stained glass, drawings, paintings, prints, costume and set designs and ephemera. A selection of his war drawings was shown at the Australian Embassy in Washington in 2005. Kahan won the Archibald Prize in 1962 with a startling portrait of Patrick White."

                            "I have no preconceived idea how to set about, because I feel painting is an adventure and very often a method Iâ€™ve been using for years, or for days, wouldnâ€™t apply to the subject or the mood. Quite generally speaking, my works in oil are based on sketches â€“ vaguely based on sketches â€“ and come to life only while Iâ€™m in the process of execution. One must always leave â€“ I at least must always leave â€“ a certain element of ambiguity which appears in the work in mental process while youâ€™re at work. I love working from life, life drawings â€“ I do quite a number, and my life drawings very often donâ€™t have any close relationship to the work Iâ€™m doing based on those drawings. My subject matter is a very varied one, for the very reason that I consider art an adventure and any path I have trodden before seems to me very often used up, and I need to find a different stimulus and a different subject or combination of ideas.\\n\\nThe actual painting of a picture doesnâ€™t take long. Very often I may only spend an hour a day in actual execution of a painting; most of the time is spent just thinking about it, looking at the work, the stage in which the work is, and so drift, think and let things develop in my mind.",

                            "Emily Kame Kngwarreye (c. 1910â€“1996) is one of Australia's most significant artists. An Anmatyerre woman, Kngwarreye was born at Alhalkere, Utopia Station in the Northern Territory. After her ancestral land was appropriated for cattle grazing, she worked as a stockhand. As she grew older she became a leader in Awelye (women's business), experienced in ceremonial body painting. In 1977 she was a founding member of the Utopia Women's Batik Group and collaborated in the production of batik, an important industry for the Anmatyerre after they regained land title. Kngwarreye began to paint on canvas late in life, in 1988. She held her first solo exhibition in 1990 at Utopia Art Sydney, and her popularity grew. During her brief career she produced thousands of canvases depicting the flowers, roots, dust and summer rains of her Country, the translucent colours built up with layered touches of paint to create an illusion of depth and movement. After her death in 1996, Kngwarreye's work represented Australia at the 1997 Venice Biennale. In 1998 a retrospective exhibition, _Alhalkere: Paintings from Utopia_, travelled to three state galleries and the National Gallery of Australia. Ten years later _Utopia: The Genius of Emily Kame Kngwarreye_, an exhibition of 120 of the artist's works, showed in Osaka and Tokyo. With that exhibition, Kngwarreye was recognised as one of the very greatest abstract artists of the twentieth century."

                            "Horace Keats (1895-1945) came to Australia from his native England in 1915 as accompanist to vaudeville performer Nella Webb. Having been persuaded to remain in the country to accompany Australian singers Ella Caspers and Peter Dawson, between 1917 and 1920 he was orchestral pianist and conductor for several operas directed by Count Filippini, and for three years from 1920 he led a trio in the restaurant of Farmer's department store. Soon after, he became involved in the formation of the ABC. During the 1920s he and his wife, soprano Janet le Brun Brown, began their long broadcasting careers; except for a short break in 1930 when he returned to England to work for the BBC as a conductor, he was associated with the ABC until he died. From 1933, when Keats began composing in earnest, he wrote more than 120 pieces. In 1934 he began setting the work of Australian poets to music. In 1936 he commenced a series of settings of Christopher Brennan's poems, to which he had been granted exclusive rights during his lifetime. These came to be regarded as some of his finest compositions. Amongst his other productions are some film scores."

She met Horace Keats in Sydney, and after hearing her sing at the New Zealand Soldiers Rest Room, he determined to make her his wife. They were married in 1918, and were to live at various addresses in Mosman throughout their lives together. Always addressed as 'Mrs Keats' by their friends, under the name of Barbara Russell she became the principal performer of his songs; he described her as his critic and guide. In 1946, the year after Keats died, Janet married the poet Hugh McRae; their marriage was dissolved two years later."

                            "Paul Kelly AO (b. 1955), singer/songwriter and producer, grew up in Adelaide and made his performing debut in Hobart in 1974. In Melbourne, he and his pub band The Dots made two albums before breaking up in 1982. He recorded _Post_ in Sydney in 1985, but his major break came the following year, by which time his band was known as The Coloured Girls. Their double album _Gossip_ was one of the biggest Australian records of 1986. The band made _Under the Sun_ (1987) before touring the US as Paul Kelly and the Messengers. They disbanded in 1991, and from that point Kelly branched into producing and acting as well as writing and performing. Kelly sings with a marked Australian accent and many of his songs refer to specific Australian people, places and experiences.\\n\\nThough he has written most of his long and poetic songlist alone, over the course of his 27 studio albums has also collaborated brilliantly, particularly with First Nations performers such as Kev Carmody, Christine Anu and Yothu Yindi. His self-described 'mongrel memoir', _How to Make Gravy_, was released in 2010 and Ian Darling's film _Paul Kelly: Stories of Me_ appeared in 2012. In 2013 Kelly was the subject of a biographical exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. The winner of seventeen ARIA awards, he was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1997. His 2019 greatest hits album _Songs from the South_ debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, his third number one album in three years (the others were _Life is Fine_ and _Nature_)."

He trained for a naval career in England, and subsequently became skilled in surveying. In 1817 he was appointed to explore the Australian coastline to consolidate the earlier work of Matthew Flinders. Over five years he made four difficult voyages, charting many gulfs, identifying several islands, and providing the first reports of Port Darwin. He was accompanied on the early voyages by Bungaree. In 1826, regarded as one of Britain's leading hydrographers, he sailed in the company of the _Beagle_ to chart Peru, Chile and Patagonia. From 1832 onwards King was an agricultural administrator, although he was promoted rear admiral on the retired list in 1855. He continued to take an interest in exploration and published many volumes on his investigations in New South Wales."

After serving in Newfoundland under Commodore Hugh Palliser, a friend and patron of Cook's, he was promoted to lieutenant in 1771 and later undertook scientific study in Paris. Recommended for Cook's third voyage, he shared duties of astronomer with Cook, contributing much to the various surveys that were completed. After Cook was killed and Charles Clerke, who had transferred from the Discovery to command the Resolution, died of tuberculosis, King commanded the Discovery on the voyage home. It was King who completed the account of the third voyage, working at Woodstock, near Oxford. In 1782, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society for his astronomical observations. After more time at sea in the Channel and the West Indies, he saw the publication of the three volumes of the voyage before dying of tuberculosis in Nice at the age of 34."

Kingsford Smith was a member of the Australian Flying Corps and the Royal Flying Corps during World War I, during which he was awarded the Military Cross. He worked in England, America and Australia as a stunt flyer and joy-flight pilot, and for West Australian Airways, before forming his own aviation company in 1924. He then embarked on a series of record flights with Ulm. The pair flew in record time around Australia, from America to Australia, from Point Cook near Melbourne to Perth, and from Sydney to Christchurch. Ulm disappeared on a flight from America to Australia, intending to demonstrate the feasibility of a commercial trans-pacific air service. Smith disappeared over the Bay of Bengal on an attempt at the Britain-Australia record."

                            "HÃ©lÃ¨ne Kirsova (1910â€“1962), dancer and founder of Kirsova Ballet, the first professional ballet company in Australia. Born Ellen Wittrup Hansen in Copenhagen, she trained as a dancer in Paris, toured with various companies in South America and danced in Paris and London. A founding member of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo in 1932, four years later she toured Australia with the company as a leading dancer, turning in sparkling performances in _Petrouchka_ and _Le Carnaval_. At the end of the tour in 1937 she went back to England but returned early in 1938 to marry the Danish Vice-Consul in Sydney, Erik Fischer. In 1940 she began a ballet school in Sydney, and the following year she established the Kirsova Ballet. She employed several dancers who had stayed in Australia following the Ballets Russes tours to Australia, including Tamara Tchinarova, and took on some young Australian dancers who would later have significant careers, such as Rachel Cameron, Strelsa Heckelman, Paul Hammond and Peggy Sager. An important patron of Australian artists, composers and set designers, Kirsova commissioned designs for her original ballets from artists such as Loudon Sainthill, Amie Kingston, Alice Danciger and Wolfgang Cardamatis. The Kirsova Ballet folded in 1944, but Kirsova kept her school running until she retired to Europe in the late 1940s."

She learnt the finer points of Cantonese cooking in her mother's kitchen, but the young Kylie aspired to be a visual artist: she studied fine arts and furniture restoration, and worked in graphic design and advertising before rediscovering her passion for food at age 25, while working for a catering company. She then apprenticed with Neil Perry at Rockpool, and within two years was made head chef at Perry's Asian-themed Wockpool. In 2000 Kylie opened her own restaurant, Billy Kwong, in Surrey Hills. Her recipes are known for their exciting blend of traditional Chinese and contemporary Australian influences. Her first cookbook was Kylie Kwong: Recipes and Stories 2003. Also in 2003 came the ABC TV series Kylie Kwong: Heart and Soul, and a book based on the series."

                            "George Lambert (1873â€“1930), artist, was born in St Petersburg and lived in Germany and England before coming to Australia with his family at the age of fourteen. He lived on his uncle's north-west NSW farm, working as a jackeroo and becoming friendly with Breaker Morant and Banjo Paterson before coming to Sydney to work as an illustrator for the _Bulletin_. He studied at the Julian Ashton Art School in Sydney from 1896 to 1900, when winning the first NSW Travelling scholarship enabled him to spend a year in Paris. He was successful both there and in London, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy and the New Salon and gained a reputation as a raconteur and man about town. During the First World War, as the only official war artist to be appointed to the rank of Honorary Captain, he produced immense, violent paintings of the landing at Gallipoli and the charge of the Light Horse at Beersheba. When he returned to Sydney in 1921 he was the most glittering figure of the art world, and between 1920 and 1930 his paintings dominated the Australian art scene. At the same time, he encouraged a new generation of modernist artists such as Thea Proctor, Roy de Maistre, Roland Wakelin and Grace Cossington Smith. Toward the end of his life, with his pupil Arthur Murch, he created the figure of the unknown soldier in St Mary's Basilica, Sydney. For Sydney's Domain he also made the statue of another old acquaintance, Henry Lawson, a work, like his war paintings, that has significantly influenced notions of Australian identity. He won the Wynne Prize in 1899, the Archibald Prize in 1927, and was an Associate of the Royal Academy."

                                "(Ms Lawford-Wolf speaking in language)\\n\\nI was sick and tired of white portrayal of Aboriginal people. And I wanted to write a theatre that was different, had all different forms of acting in it whether it be music, dance, singing, a monologue. And I wanted to stay in the traditional way of storytelling but make it real, make it different. And the only way, and the only way I can do stories like that was to fall back on myself and my plays, like â€˜You know, youâ€™ve got a story yourself, youâ€™ve been to Alaska when you were 16, you know, you lived here, you lived there, youâ€™ve come from Christmas Creek station, youâ€™ve come up from nowhere and make a name for yourself in the acting world and that is an achievement for someone my age. And I never really thought about it because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m anything special. I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m still quite naive in that aspect.\\n\\nI wanted to make it honest too, â€˜cos you look at a lot of Aboriginal people that are working out there, thereâ€™s a lot of Aboriginal women that are working but not really strong Aboriginal womenâ€™s stories. And I wanted to make my point of view as a woman and as a proud Aboriginal woman, proud of where I come from, whether than be the backblocks of Woop Woop but yet that place still has a very big significance for me. I wanted to make Australia realise that they do have an Indigenous culture in Australia. They have it here. No, no, and Australia doesnâ€™t need to go anywhere else and adopt someone elseâ€™s Indigenous culture which a lot of people tend to do. But, you know, they have it here. And nobody hasnâ€™t discovered it, itâ€™s so funny going to Europe, for me, and more European people know more about Aboriginal Australia than Australians do so which is quite sad, which is really really quite sad. It goes to show how ignorant white Australia is.",

                            "Adrian Lawlor, critic and artist, came to Australia from his native England at the age of about twenty. After serving in the AIF during the First World War he settled in Warrandyte and began to write for the Bulletin and other publications. During the 1930s, he studied at George Bell's Bourke Street school and was a frequent visitor to Bell's studio; over that decade he held eight exhibitions in Melbourne and became an office-bearer in Bell's Contemporary Artists Group. Along with Sidney Nolan, Lawlor was singled out by Bell as an artist who 'dared to think for [himself]'. In 1939, more than 200 of his paintings were destroyed in a fire at his Warrandyte home. Subsequently, he established his reputation as a critic in print and on the wireless, over which he broadcast his opinions on art from 1936 to 1951. Following the death of his wife and the failure of his novel, _The Horned Capon_ (1949) Lawlor went into sad decline. Although fewer than sixty of his paintings are known to have survived, he is represented in the National Gallery of Australia and several state and regional galleries."

                            "Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830) was one of the leading portrait painters of the Georgian era. The son of a Bristol innkeeper, Lawrence was precociously talented and by age 10 his pastel portraits were the main source of his family's income. By the time he was 13, his family had settled in Bath, where Lawrence earned a good income from portraits of the spa town's fashionable inhabitants. Soon after, he began painting in oils and went to London, enrolling in the Royal Academy in 1787. With the death of Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1792, Lawrence became the most sought-after portraitist in England. Appointed principal painter to the courts of George III and George IV, his sitters included numerous British royals and those of Europe, as well as many of society's notables, including Joseph Banks, Lord Melbourne and the Duke of Wellington. The National Portrait Gallery, London, which holds numerous examples of his work, describes Lawrence as having 'the temperament and flair to capture the glamour of the age â€¦ with dazzling brushwork and an innovative use of colour.' He became a member of the Royal Academy in 1794 and was knighted in 1815. \\n\\nThe National Portrait Gallery has eight prints made after paintings by Lawrence, representing such figures as Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool; the Rt Honorable Lord Hawkesbury; and William Lamb, Baron Melbourne."

                            "Percy Leason, artist, illustrator and cartoonist, grew up in Victoria's Wimmera region and trained in the rudiments of art in Nhill. In 1907 he was apprenticed to the Melbourne printers Sands & McDougall as a lithographic artist. There he met Richard McCann, with whom he attended evening classes at the NGV school in the evenings; together, they produced the poster for Carlton Breweries, 'I allus has one at eleven'. In 1911 Leason set up an art studio with McCann, William Frater and others, making a precarious living through book illustration and commissions. In 1917 he moved to Sydney to take up a contract with the publishers Smith & Julius. Successful book illustration and inclusion in the 1918 Society of Artists exhibition brought him to the attention of artist and teacher Julian Rossi Ashton; both Ashton and the Art Gallery of New South Wales acquired his work and he soon took the place of political cartoonist David Low at the Bulletin. He worked stably as an illustrator, cartoonist and artist until 1924, when perturbed by the 'new wave' of Modernism sweeping Sydney, he sought solace in Melbourne. There, he was introduced to Max Meldrum, who espoused a theory of tonal objective painting which accorded with his own views. The men's relationship, at times tinged by professional jealousy, was of considerable benefit to both in the formulation of their respective and at times mutual tenets of painting. Upon Leason's return to Sydney, Keith Murdoch offered him a contract cartooning for Punch, based in Melbourne. Henceforth Australia's highest-paid cartoonist, he built a home in Eltham which became a hub for Melbourne artists, writers and performers. When Punch was absorbed into the society journal Table Talk in 1925, Leason continued to provide cartoons for it as well as the Bulletin. His 'Wiregrass' cartoon, illustrating humorous aspects of life in a fictitious country town, appeared in Table Talk from 1926 to 1937. \\n\\nIn 1929 Leason provided illustrations and a model of a rock shelter containing Aboriginal paintings for the National Museum of Victoria's Aboriginal Art Exhibition. Through his role in the exhibition he met anthropologist Donald Thomson, and in 1934, on a field trip with Thomson and other colleagues, he completed twenty-eight portraits of Aboriginal people from Lake Tyers. \\n\\nIn 1938 Leason moved to the USA and settled in Staten Island, where he exhibited and became President of the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences. At his art school, the Modern Perceptual School of Painting, he, his wife and daughter conducted virtually round-the-clock art classes for the community in realist tonal painting. The school continued in various guises until 1955. During these years Leason undertook many commissions, and he won the Audubon Society's Hollander Prize in 1945. He joined the artists' society the Salmagundi Club, and became an elected member of the Royal Art Society in London. Having continued to illustrate, teach and exhibit throughout the 1950s, in 1957 he travelled to Europe for the first time, to view cave art. He published his observations on cave paintings in the journals of the British Medical Association and the Staten Island Institute; plaster models and drawings from tracings he made in France are in the State Library of Victoria."

                            "Kerrie Lester (1953â€“2016) became well-known as a portraitist for her playful, textured, highly coloured works that appeared regularly in the Archibald and Portia Geach exhibitions of the late 1980s and the 1990s. Born in Sydney, Lester studied at the National Art School and the Alexander Mackie College between 1971 and 1975. She held her first solo exhibition in 1976 and featured regularly in group exhibitions including the Wynne and Sulman prizes and the Mosman Art Prize, which she won in 2011. Her bold and distinctive portraits, in which the outlines of the sitters are hand-stitched, were contenders for the Archibald Prize at least sixteen times and, from 1988 until her death in 2016, she figured in the Portia Geach Memorial Award shortlist nine times, her sitters including Phillip Noyce, Judy Cassab, Jeffrey Smart, Akira Isogawa, Jimmy Barnes, Margaret Fink and Trent Nathan. Her _Self-portrait as a Bridesmaid_ took out the Archibald's Packing Room Prize in 1998. Lesterâ€™s painting of athlete Cathy Freeman was among the first 50 works acquired for the National Portrait Gallery's collection. Art historian Gavin Fry has suggested that 'the appeal of Kerrie Lester's work lies in the way it embodies both the serious and the whimsical, the fleeting and the solid, the wry smile with instant recognition of our own weaknesses and excesses'."

London-born, Lewis had worked as a surveyor and draftsman for almost fifteen years before being appointed to a position in the office of the Surveyor-General of New South Wales, Thomas Mitchell. Lewis assisted Mitchell in surveying areas of the Great Dividing Range and, at Mitchellâ€™s instigation, was appointed New South Wales Government Architect in 1835. During his fifteen year tenure in this role, Lewis oversaw the implementation of an ambitious program of public works, designing churches, schools, police stations, courthouses and prisons, as well as residences. Examples of his buildings include the courthouses and gaols at Darlinghurst and Berrima; the Customs House at Circular Quay; the Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum (now known as Gladesville Hospital); the Kingâ€™s School, Parramatta; and Richmond Villa, constructed beside the Domain as Lewisâ€™s private residence in 1849, but relocated to Millers Point in the 1970s. Lewis also supervised the construction of Sydneyâ€™s Government House, designed in London by Edward Blore and comlpeted in 1845. Lewis resigned as Government Architect in 1849 pending an official enquiry that was to find that he had misappropriated materials intended for the first Australian Museum. Of his and Elizabethâ€™s five children, three â€“ sons Oswald, Mortimer junior and Frederick â€“ became architects. Lewis went into private practice with Oswald for a time. He died in Sydney in March 1879. During the 1830s, Mortimer Lewis acquired seventeen acres of coastal land in what is now the Sydney suburb of Bronte. Lewis commenced building a villa on the property â€“ Bronte House â€“ but managed to complete only the dining and drawing rooms before being forced to sell in 1843. The house was completed for the new owners, politician Robert Lowe and his wife, Georgiana, in 1845. Opinions vary on whether these portraits of Mortimer and Elizabeth Lewis were painted in England before they left for Australia, or are the work of a colonial artist. They remained in the collection of the Lewis family until being purchased by Leo Schofield, then the occupant of Bronte House, in 1998. They hung in Bronte House until gifted by Schofield to the National Portrait Gallery in 2002."

                            "I like to have my sitter sit for me and then I do a sketch or a couple of sketches, and then I proceed to put it on canvas, just block it in. I donâ€™t use pencil or crayons very often, I like to use a brush with a very thin medium, and I draw it in onto the canvas and then I do a lot of blocking in, and then I like to have my sitter back when Iâ€™ve done all the preparing, and then paint with my sitter present.\\n\\nSometimes, of course, I come into very difficult problems because my models havenâ€™t got as much time as they â€“ as I â€“ would need and I try and do as much without them from memory and occasionally have to have a photo taken, and try and do a little from that. But I donâ€™t think you can ever get the colour and the feeling trying to ever paint from a photograph. You must have the live person there and you get some inspiration from them as youâ€™re working, I think on portraiture anyway.\\n\\nI like to have my portraits with a feeling that they are casual and not in every detail, because sometimes I think I feel as if theyâ€™re overworked and have a very tight feeling about them. I like the loose flowing feelings and a little bit of softness and a little bit of imagination left to it.",

                            "David Lloyd Jones (1931â€“1961) was the great-grandson of the original David Jones â€“ who founded the eponymous department store in Sydney in 1838 â€“ and the eldest son of Sir Charles Lloyd Jones (1878â€“1958), who was chairman of David Jones Ltd from 1920 until his death. Educated at Cranbrook School, David L Jones (as he called himself) was seventeen when his father began preparing him as his successor. David was sent to work in David Jones' London office and to learn about textiles in Manchester before spending some time as a salesman in the toy department at Harrods. He then undertook a year-long executive training course at Macy's in New York. He is said to have acquired a taste for modern art while he was there. Returning to Sydney in 1951, he was put in charge of the first floor of David Jones' flagship Elizabeth Street premises and subsequently became manager of it, and of the stores in Perth and Wagga Wagga. He married Rosemary Turnbull in 1953; in 1954, aged 23, he became the youngest director of David Jones in the firm's history. A profile which appeared in the _Australian Women's Weekly_ in January 1957 noted that he usually took the tram to work from his terrace house in Woollahra, and that his salary 'has always erred on the meagre side' because that was the way he wanted it. 'A tireless worker', he was said to be at work each day well before opening time, and was 'still there at night when the doors are closed after the last of the customers have scurried from the store.'\\n\\nA councilor of the Retail Traders Association, he became an alderman of the City of Sydney in 1956, representing the Civic Reform Association. He was also a member of the Board of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, the Sydney Chamber of Commerce and the Swedish Chamber of Commerce, and was a founding member of the council of the Art Gallery Society of New South Wales. He became Deputy Chairman and joint Managing Director of David Jones Ltd following his father's death in 1958; in 1960, he was appointed Chairman. Hailed as Australia's most successful young businessman, at the time of his death, aged 30, in June 1931, David Jones employed more than 8000 people and had an annual turnover of thirty-nine million pounds."

                            "Sir John Longstaff, born in Clunes, Victoria, studied at the NGV school from 1883 to 1887 and thenceforth at Corman's in Paris. Becoming friends with the Australian expatriate impressionist John Russell, he met Toulouse-Lautrec and others, but his own style remained conservative and he exhibited at the Salon and the RA in the early 1890s. 'Tall, handsome and charming', according to his biographer Leigh Astbury, 'Longstaff moved effortlessly in society circles where his skills as a portraitist were eagerly sought'. Indeed, his sitters included King Edward and Queen Alexandra. In London in 1907 he completed his colossal Arrival of Burke, Wills and King at the deserted camp at Cooper's Creek, Sunday evening, 21st April 1861, now in the collection of the NGV. During World War I he painted many portraits of leading Australian military figures (his cousin, Will Longstaff, painted some of the iconic paintings of the Australian War Memorial, as well as the portrait of Walter Lindrum now owned by the National Portrait Gallery). John Longstaff's 1923 painting of Nellie Melba was presented to the NGV from Melba's estate in 1932. John Longstaff won the Archibald Prize five times between 1925 and 1935; during this period, in 1928, he was knighted. From 1927 until his death in Melbourne in 1941 he was a trustee of the NGV."

                            "Fiona Lowry is a Sydney-based artist. Having held her first solo exhibition in 2002, she exhibited at Sydneyâ€™s Gallery Barry Keldoulis from 2004 to 2010; from 2010 she was also represented by Hugo Michell in Adelaide, and she is currently handled by Martin Browne Contemporary in Sydney. Her delicate, yet disturbing paintings are characteristically made using an airbrush and a restricted palette of soft, pastel colours. In 2008, she won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize for a self-portrait in the Belanglo State Forest, the site of a series of murders in the mid-1990s. In 2010 her work was included in Wilderness: Balnaves contemporary: painting at the Art Gallery of NSW. She was a finalist in the 2011 Archibald Prize with a portrait of artist Tim Silver and in 2012 she had works in the Wynne and Sulman Prizes. In 2013 she won the Fleurieu Prize with a landscape of the Shoalhaven and was highly commended in the Archibald with a portrait of Shaun Gladwell; in 2014 she won the Archibald with a portrait of Penelope Seidler."

                            "David Malouf (b.1934), educated at Brisbane Grammar and the University of Queensland, left Australia at the age of 24 and remained abroad for a decade, teaching in England and travelling throughout Europe. After returning to Australia in 1968 he taught English at the University of Sydney and began to publish poetry â€“ his first collection was the 1970 volume Bicycle and Other Poems. His first novel, the acclaimed Johnno, appeared in 1975. Since turning to writing full-time in 1977 Malouf has published five further books of poetry, three libretti â€“ including an adaptation of Patrick Whiteâ€™s Voss (1978) for the Australian Opera â€“ and an autobiography, 12 Edmonstone Street (1985). He is best known, however, for his novels. An Imaginary Life won the 1979 NSW Premierâ€™s Literary Award; Fly Away Peter won the Age Book of the Year Award in 1982; The Great World won the Miles Franklin Award in 1990; Remembering Babylon was shortlisted for 1994â€™s Booker Prize; The Conversations at Curlow Creek was nominated for the 1997 Miles Franklin Award. His non-fiction essays include On Experience (2008) and The happy life (2011). He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2008. His most recent book, Ransom (2009) retelling the last eight books of the Iliad, is already on the Victorian school syllabus. Having divided his time between residences in Australia and Tuscany for some years, he now mostly lives in Sydney."

                            "I think what Rick was looking for in the portrait was the person who is the writer. And the person who is the writer is not necessarily the person that presents themselves. So, he was looking behind the sociable gesture or the sociable person for, I think, the person who does the writing, who is often a quite secret self and mysterious and unknown even to the person who does the writing. That is, you know, the place the writing comes from is somewhere different from your social self.\\n\\nWhen youâ€™re a writer you have to discover how your own imagination works and how you can recreate on the page something that will stir the readerâ€™s imagination in the same way. Of course, because itâ€™s language thatâ€™s very, very much to do with rhythm and with cadence and things like that and I donâ€™t make a distinction between how important rhythm is in say poetry to how important it is in prose as well. And I think of almost everything I write, including the short stories or novels or even a piece of non-fictional prose, I think of that as being, when Iâ€™m writing it, as being something that will be read aloud, and read aloud in the readerâ€™s mind even if they donâ€™t think that thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re doing.\\n\\nI grew up in a generation where our visual imagination was absolutely stimulated and decided by film. And so almost always, I think, when Iâ€™m writing, I see whatâ€™s there as if it were either a still from a film or an unfolding piece of action in the film.",

                            "Fanny Jane Marlay (1819â€“1848), was the second-eldest daughter of military officer, Edward Marlay (1792â€“1839). A veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, Marlay came to Australia with his family around 1825, and by the time of Stokesâ€™s visit was the barrack master-general in Sydney. Stokes and Fanny Jane Marlay married in Sydney in January 1841. Later the same year, Stokes succeeded Wickham to the command of the Beagle. Their daughter, Fanny Anne, was born in 1842 at The Vineyard, Parramatta, (the home of Phillip Parker Kingâ€™s brother-in-law), where Fanny Jane was living while the Beagle continued its survey of the Australian coast. Back in England between 1843 and 1847, Stokes â€“ whose 18 years on the Beagle had made him its longest-serving officer â€“ published his two-volume account of its third voyage, Discoveries in Australia (1846). Promoted to captain and appointed to the command of the Acheron in 1847, Stokes sailed south again to undertake the first full hydrographical survey of New Zealand. Fanny Jane died in South Africa while en route to Sydney with Stokes in 1848."

                            "Alan Marshall AM OBE (1902-1984), writer, began life in Victoriaâ€™s Western District. At the age of six he contracted infantile paralysis (polio) which left him permanently disabled. When he was a teenager his family moved to Melbourne, where he wrote with great dedication from the early 1920s and worked as an accountant at a shoe factory from 1930 to 1935. In 1933 he won the first of his three Australian Literary Society Short Story Awards. At last, in 1934, one of his stories was published; from then on he wrote for _Workerâ€™s Voice_, the _Communist Review_ and the _Left Review_; _Smithâ€™s Weekly_, the _Bulletin_, _ABC Weekly_, _Bohemia_ and _Meanjin_. He edited the anti-fascist review _Point_ and was president of the Victorian Writersâ€™ League; though he never joined the Communist Party, he attracted the interest of ASIO immediately upon its formation in 1949. _These Are My People_, stories he collected while travelling with his wife Olive in a horse-drawn caravan through Victoria, was published in 1944; his encounters with Aboriginal people on two trips north were published as _Ourselves Writ Strange_ in 1948. During the 1950s he wrote a regular advice column for the _Argus_. The vicissitudes and triumphs of his childhood are detailed in his best-known, autobiographical work, _I Can Jump Puddles_ (1955), the first volume of a trilogy. The book sold more than 3 million copies and was translated into many languages; it was made into an award-winning film in Czechoslovakia in 1970 and an Australian television series in 1981. Living in the artistsâ€™ enclave of Eltham from 1955, Marshall continued to write prolifically, including popular tales of the imaginary Speewah station, but his autobiographical works gradually darkened in tone until his friend and publisher Frank Cheshire refused to bring out _Hammers Over the Anvil_ (which eventually appeared in 1975). Marshall was made OBE in 1972, received the Soviet Order of Friendship in 1977 and was made AM in 1981. Late in life he worked on projects highlighting various challenges confronting people with disabilities. He is commemorated in the annual Alan Marshall Award for Literature, the award for childrenâ€™s literature in the Victorian Premierâ€™s Literary Awards and the annual Alan Marshall Award in Eltham Shire, Victoria."

                            "I think I wrote 20 short stories before I had one published and I won 12 literary competitions. When I won a competition, I imagined I must be good, and yet I couldnâ€™t get them published. So I had to keep on and I remember one of the stories that I won a prize with was called _A Little Son_ and it was a story of my mother away outback and it described the birth of one of my sisters. And she told me the story and it won the Australian Literature Societyâ€™s short story competition for one year and I had to read it out aloud. And I brought my mother in to listen to it; she was a very wonderful person. And there Iâ€™m describing how she had knotted towels at the head of her bed and while she was lying on this bed, away outback, with a blowing dust and the hessian above her head, and where father sometimes used to pierce it with a knife and catch the dust in a bucket; sheâ€™s lying there and she said â€˜All that I could rememberâ€™, she told me, very vividly, â€˜was the smell of the Myall wood stockwhip handle that was hanging at the end of the bedâ€™.\\n\\nSo I wrote that story and I liked it, but people seemed rather shocked at it at the time, to motherâ€™s astonishment. And I remember some woman coming up to her there and saying â€˜Your son must be marriedâ€™, and she said â€˜No, heâ€™s not, heâ€™s telling about meâ€™.\\n\\nWhen I began working in the city, that was the sad time of my life. See I think that when youâ€™re crippled, childhood is fairly happy. It is not the affliction that makes life hard but the attitude of people towards it, and this manifests itself very strongly in your teens. That is the time when you want to grab a girl. And Iâ€™ve described this period, although not very well Iâ€™m afraid, in In _Mine Own Heart_.\\n\\nWhat I wanted to do was to describe how I broke through this feeling of restriction, of sadness, and I succeeded in doing it but I havenâ€™t quite succeeded in doing it as I wanted to do in my books. I have one more to write at the time of speaking and that will describe that period of my life when I moved round with artists and writers and when I became much more confident in myself.",

                            "David McAllister AC (b. 1963), dancer and former artistic director of the Australian Ballet, was born in Perth and began studying ballet in the early 1970s. Having weathered harassment from both schoolmates and teachers for his love of dance, at seventeen he left for Melbourne and further training at the Australian Ballet School. He joined the Australian Ballet in 1983, won bronze at the Fifth International Ballet Competition in Moscow in 1985, and was promoted to principal artist with the company in 1989. Working under successive artistic directors Maina Gielgud and Ross Stretton, McAllister's major roles included those in _Onegin_, _Romeo and Juliet_, _La Fille mal gardee_, _Don Quixote_, _The Sentimental Bloke_, _Coppelia_, _Manon_, _La Sylphide_, _Sinfonietta_ and _Stepping Stones_. As a guest artist he has danced with the Bolshoi Ballet, the Kirov Ballet, the National Ballet of Canada, the Birmingham Royal Ballet and the Singapore Dance Theatre, among other companies. After making his final appearance as dancer in _Giselle_ in 2001 he became the Australian Ballet's artistic director shortly afterwards. During twenty years in this role, McAllister helped to transform the company into one of the best dance companies in the world. In his 2020 memoir _Soar: A Life Freed by Dance_ he writes that highlights of his tenure include choreographing a new production of _Sleeping Beauty_ (2015), commissioning new works, supporting local choreographers and introducing a maternity leave policy and a health and wellness team. Since retiring in 2020, he has choreographed a new _Swan Lake_ (2021) for the Finnish National Ballet."

                            "I was one of those weird kids that just always wanted to dance. My family, you know, are fantastic; they're wonderful people. Dad was an accountant, Mum was my mum and I have brothers and sisters that there's no artistic sort of dance background in our family at all. So, I was this sort of mutant child who, you know, used to dance around the house all the time and I used to dance in front of the TV when the TV was off so I could see myself, you know, moving around. And whenever there was a family gathering, I was always putting on a show and annoying the hell out of everyone. So, I guess it was in my DNA and I didn't really have a plan B. Iâ€™d started training when I was seven. I didn't realize that all the other boys at school wouldn't think it was quite as cool as what I did. So, that was, a life journey. But yeah, I just love to dance. And I guess ballet, because I saw some ballet on TV, which was Rudolf Nureyev doing Don Quixote with the Australian Ballet. And I went, Oh, that's the sort of dance I want to do. And then I went to a ballet school and 10 years later I was in Melbourne at the Australian Ballet School. And two years later I joined the company.\\n\\nI've got to say the first time I saw that portrait, I was just in awe really. I'd seen all of the preparatory work that Peter had done through his journals and diaries and things, and he talked a lot about it. So, I guess I knew that the dance element would be as it was, and it was incredibly beautiful. But I had no idea of what I'd look like. And it was really, really amazing. He caught a moment that sort of not, I guess what people would think necessarily is a former dancer and, a, you know, artistic director, because we tend to be on, you know, sort of like â€˜Welcome to the balletâ€™. And it was sort of more of a pensive moment. And I really liked that â€™cos, you know, I feel like it's the side of me that sometimes people don't get to see. And so it's beautiful that it's the side that he's shown.",

                            "Robert McFarlane (1942â€“2023), photographer, was born in Glenelg, South Australia. After leaving school he began work in a small advertising agency, where his growing interest in photography was encouraged. In 1963 he moved to Sydney, where he began freelancing for magazines including the _Bulletin_, _Vogue Australia_ and _Walkabout_. McFarlane's 1964 photograph of Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins on a Sydney bus is one of his most recognisable images. At the same time, as editor of the magazine _Camera World_, he began his lifelong career writing about photography. In the early 1970s he travelled and worked overseas. Since 1973 he has documented Australian society and key figures in politics and the performing arts, taking stills photographs on a great number of significant Australian films and theatre productions. He has exhibited in solo and group shows and has written regular photography criticism for the _Australian_ and the _Sydney Morning Herald_. His work is represented in the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of NSW and the National Library as well as the National Portrait Gallery."

                            "William Beckwith (Bill) McInnes (1889â€“1939), artist, was only fourteen when he began studying drawing under Frederick McCubbin at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, before moving to painting. In 1912 he travelled around Europe and the UK, and his landscapes were exhibited at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters in London in 1913. Back in Melbourne he held successful exhibitions and taught drawing at the National Gallery School from 1916 to 1934. Beginning in 1921, McInnes won the Archibald Prize seven times, writing in defence of his conservative work that 'in Australia we have not been bitten by Cubism or Futurism or other isms â€¦ and I am glad of it'. Sir William Dargie was the only artist to win more times than McInnes; Dargie employed a style similar to McInnes, of optical realism based on tonal values, which had been handed down from Bernard Hall, McInnes' teacher, via Max Meldrum to Archibald Colquhoun, Dargie's teacher. In 1927 McInnes was commissioned, with Septimus Power, to paint the opening of Federal Parliament by HRH the Duke of York. He went to London in 1933 to paint the Duke's portrait. The following year he acted as director of the National Gallery of Victoria, and became Head of the National Gallery School, a position he held until shortly before his death."

                            "Noel McKenna (b. 1956), artist, is best known for his spare linear style and paintings of everyday scenarios, often featuring animals and interiors. He grew up in Brisbane, where he studied architecture before switching to art school. In the late 1970s he moved to Sydney, living in share houses and using an office in an old Elizabeth Street building as a studio. As the garment trade evaporated in Surry Hills, he took studio space there. For much of the 1980s he worked by night at the Cosmopolitan CafÃ© and Twenty One in Double Bay. Horses have been central to his art from the beginning, inspired by trips to the races with his father. 'Being a painter is a bigger gamble than being a punter, in terms of getting a collect,' the artist once observed. His first solo exhibition was a show of etchings of horses, at the Garry Anderson gallery in Potts Point. In 1993 he began painting on ceramics in a commercial shopfront in Newtown, and the following year had a solo exhibition at Roslyn Oxley9 in Sydney â€“ an assortment of horses painted on plates, with dainty dotted borders. He won the Sulman Prize in 1994 and has taken out the Art Gallery of New South Wales Trustees' prize for watercolour five times. Both the Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art and the Art Gallery of New South Wales have shown major series by McKenna. Twenty of his works were shown in _The Popular Pet Show_ at the National Portrait Gallery in 2016."

A co-founder, in 1975, of the Photographers Gallery, McNicol held his first exhibition, with Carol Jerrems, in 1978 at Brummels Gallery â€“ the first Australian gallery dedicated to the work of photographers. Soon afterwards, he moved into studio space in Fitzroy, and between 1978 and 1986 created a series of black-and-white portraits of his friends and contemporaries â€“ 'artists, actors, drug addicts and other fellow marginals', as McNicol has said. This series was exhibited in Melbourne, Cracow and Paris in the 1980s. In 1989â€“1990, McNicol undertook an Australia Council-funded residency in the cancer ward of Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, during which time he created a series of portraits of terminally ill patients, exhibited as Art and the Cancer Ward in Melbourne in 1992. Deeply affected by this experience, McNicol shelved his photographic practice for several years during the 1990s. He completed a Master of Fine Arts at Monash University in 2007, his major project being to recreate the portraits from the 1978â€“1986 _Portrait of Melbourne_ series. McNicol's work has been included in many solo and group exhibitions including the Australian Photographic Portrait Prize (2004â€“2006); the Olive Cotton Portrait Prize (2005â€“2008); and the National Portrait Gallery exhibitions _Reveries: Photography and Mortality_ (2007) and _Life and Time: Portraits by Rod McNicol_ (2015). The winner of the 2004 Australian Photographic Portrait Prize, McNicol was a finalist in 2007 and 2010. He took out the National Photographic Portrait Prize in 2012 with his portrait of his friend, actor Jack Charles, who McNicol has been photographing since the 1970s. McNicol's work is represented in major collections including those of the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Monash Gallery of Art, and the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale, Paris."

In 1916 he founded an art school in the city, and many students from the NGV school left it to join Meldrum's. They were the first of many generations of Australian artists known as 'Meldrumites', who were indoctrinated in what Meldrum believed to be the 'invariable truths of depictive art' and the 'science of appearance' relating to tonal and space relations between objects."

                            "Nancy Menetrey (nÃ©e Wilkinson) (1924-2024) was born in Sydney in 1924. After serving with the Australian Women's Land Army, formed during the Second World War to address labour shortages in the agricultural sector, she travelled overseas in the early 1950s, living and working in London for a number of years. She returned to Australia with her Swiss fiancÃ©, Phillipe Gabriel Menetrey, who she married in Rockdale, Sydney, in 1956. Largely self-taught as an artist, Menetrey became a member of the (selective) St George Art Society in the 1950s, and is thought to be the first woman accepted into its ranks.\\n\\nUnder her married name she entered the Archibald Prize in 1957 with the portrait of her colleague, photographer Noel Fraser Hickey; and in 1958 with a painting of Pat Woodley, model and former Miss New South Wales and Miss Australia. The painting of Hickey was among the 69 works selected for the 1957 Archibald exhibition. Menetrey left Australia again in 1958 and spent the next decade living in Canada and Switzerland. After returning to Sydney in 1969, she held the occasional solo exhibition and exhibited in a number of group shows, including the Portia Geach Memorial Award several times in the 1970s. She was president of the Kuring-Gai Art Society from 1979 to 1981. Among Menetrey's other portrait subjects were Rita Young (nÃ©e Lee), who modelled for artists such as Norman Lindsay, Rah Fizelle, Max Dupain and Kerry Dundas in the 1930s and 1940s; and author and conservationist Mary Edgeworth David, the daughter of the Antarctic explorer and eminent geologist Sir Tannatt William Edgeworth David. In the 1970s she painted a commissioned portrait of Admiral Sir Victor Smith (1913â€“1998), former Chief of Navy, which is on display at HMAS Albatross in Nowra."

                            "Samuel Metford was born in Glastonbury, into a Quaker family. In England he came to specialise in full-length silhouette likenesses, cut from black paper and embellished with gold and white paint. According to the standard text on British silhouettes, Metford made 'some very fine family groups - Father and Mother surrounded by their children and pets, with hand-painted backgrounds of imposing rooms whose tall windows looked out on wide landscapes, or a seascape with a tall-funnelled steamship in a prominent position.' Metford moved to America in about 1834, and spent some ten years there, working mostly in Connecticut but also in New York and South Carolina. He returned to England in the early 1840s, and lived there for the rest of his life, although he revisited America in 1869 and 1867. He died at Weston-Super-Mare."

                            "Jacqueline Mitelman (b. 1952), photographer, was born in Scotland and moved to Australia with her family at the age of five. At twenty she moved to France, where she worked as a model and actress. In the mid-1970s she studied photography at Prahran College in Melbourne under Athol Shmith, Paul Cox and John Cato. Since then she has worked as a freelance photographer specialising in portraiture. Her work has appeared in Australia and internationally in magazines and newspapers, on CD and book covers and on theatre and music posters; her wide-ranging commissions have given rise to a considerable collection of portraits of culturally significant Australians. Mitelman won the National Photographic Portrait Prize in 2011 and the National Portrait Gallery owns twenty of her portraits. Her works are also held by the National Library, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Museum of Modern Art at Heide and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery."

                            "I remember when I was very young and still a teenager and doing some work in the darkroom. It was really the first time [that] time disappeared for me, you know; I was so excited about doing it.\\n\\nMost people, even people who are really well known and photographed all the time, feel a bit vulnerable. Itâ€™s incredibly easy to take a horrible picture of somebody where they look really tense and they donâ€™t look like themselves. So, I guess Iâ€™m interested in people being comfortable. And Iâ€™m interested in, not the eyes that are uncomfortable andâ€™ how Iâ€™m going to lookâ€™, Iâ€™m interested in the eyes that try to get some sort of straight gaze where at least you have the impression that youâ€™re contacting the essence of that person. I mean, there was a phrase that I quite used to like, which was Buddha Nature, which means, you know, like that in you which doesnâ€™t change. Obviously, it can be damaged, but you can take pictures of quite small children. And you know that thereâ€™s something in that photograph that if you came back 50 years later, there would be still the same thing in it. And thatâ€™s sort of, I guess, what Iâ€™m interested in, really.\\n\\nTaking photographs is a bit like a temporary infatuation for me. Because Iâ€™m not interested in taking awkward pictures of somebody. So itâ€™s a bit like, you know, that process when you fall in love with somebody, they do one thing, into that one thing you attach all these qualities which they donâ€™t have, they just do that one thing. But you donâ€™t want to show somehow â€¦ you donâ€™t want to see the bad things in that state. You just put all the good things together. Iâ€™ve taken photographs of people who have looked at them afterwards and Iâ€™ve thought, yes, the person whoâ€™s in love with him sees him like that.",

                            "Tracey Moffatt AO (b. 1960) is an artist whose work reflects on issues including race, childhood trauma, gender and popular culture. Born in Brisbane, she graduated from the Queensland College of Art in 1982. After moving to Sydney, Moffatt was one of the co-founders of the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative, and worked with Anthony (Ace) Bourke to curate NADOC '86 exhibition of Aboriginal and Islander photographers. In 1987 she made her first short film, _Nice Coloured Girls_. Moffatt became widely known through her celebrated first solo exhibition, _Something More_ (1989). In 1990 her short film _Night Cries â€“ A Rural Tragedy_ (1989) was selected for official competition at the Cannes Film Festival, as was her first feature-length film, _Bedevil_, in 1993. Following the photographic series _Scarred for Life_ (1994) she was invited to exhibit in the Venice Biennale in 1997, and during that year held solo exhibitions in Germany, Denmark, France and the USA. Since then, she has built an international reputation with a body of films and photographic series such as _Laudanum_ (1998), _Invocations_ (2000), _Under the Sign of Scorpio_ (2005), _First Jobs_ (2008) and _Spirit Landscapes_ (2013). In 2007 she received the Infinity Award from New York's International Center of Photography; in 2012 she had a solo show at the cityâ€™s Museum of Modern Art. She became the first Aboriginal artist to present a solo exhibition, _My Horizon_, at the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017. Moffatt's work is represented in all major Australian galleries."

                            "Helge Jon Molvig was born and grew up in Newcastle, where he left school at thirteen and worked in a garage and at the steelworks. After war service in New Guinea and Manila, he enrolled as an art student under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme at the Strathfield campus of East Sydney Technical College. He exhibited with the Strath Art Group between 1949 and 1954 (thereafter, he was part of no group). During this period, from 1949 to 1952, he travelled in Europe, where he was particularly influenced by the German and Norwegian expressionists. In 1955 he settled in Brisbane, where he began to paint passionately intense and personal works that are now in the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Queensland Art Gallery. As a teacher, he encouraged a number of innovative artists including Andrew Sibley and Merv Moriarty to pursue their own visions. In 1961 he won the inaugural Transfield prize, the countryâ€™s richest art award, and was able to purchase land near Brisbane on which he built a house. Through the 1960s he won a series of art prizes in Queensland, and exhibited with the Sydney dealer Rudy Komon. Molvigâ€™s work is notoriously variable in style; his many portraits illustrate his many different approaches to his art. From 1952 he entered the Archibald, but was not hung until 1955. In 1966, his portraits of Charles Blackman and Sir Charles Moses were both hung; he won the prize for the Blackman portrait, which is now in the Art Gallery of South Australia. From the late 1960s he was increasingly ill with chronic kidney disease; he died following the rejection of a kidney transplant in Brisbane. A retrospective of his work initiated by the Newcastle Region Art Gallery toured nationally in 1978. Molvig is represented in all major Australian galleries, with his striking portraits dispersed between them."

                            "I donâ€™t know whether youâ€™ve ever noticed it, but colour has a lot of psychological significance; some colours can make you happy and some sad, some heavy and some light. I try to use colours that heighten the feeling of what I want to say. For instance, if I was painting a young girl, I wouldnâ€™t use browns and purples and heavy colours like that; Iâ€™d naturally use something thatâ€™s light and youthful and airy, happy, perhaps, depending on whether I wanted to make her happy or sad. If I was painting an old man, I wouldnâ€™t use light greens and light blues, things like that. Thatâ€™s only a very rough basis for psychology of colour.\\n\\nQuite often I use drawings, particularly in portraits. When I have a portrait commission to do â€“ not a commission necessarily but a portrait â€“ I usually do a lot of drawings. I like to become familiar with the subject, especially the character of the subject and the general feeling of it. I usually throw the drawing away and do the painting from memory. But usually now, with an ordinary subject, I just start straight on the large canvas and work it out from there. Once a picture is started, it sort of paints itself. What I mean is: when you put a brushstroke down, it indicates the next brushstroke to put down and so on, itâ€™s like doing a jigsaw puzzle in which you put one piece in place and you have to find another piece to fit in with it.",

And he introduced me to the authorities that were handling the staging of the play. And I particularly wanted to show the Parthenon at the top of the hill, at the top of the Acropolis, behind the action that was going on, on the stage. But this meant getting the floodlights turned on, on the Parthenon at a particular time. Now, I thought this would be very, very difficult indeed, but as it turned out, the authorities were only too pleased to co-operate, and they said â€˜No, that would be no problemâ€™, and â€˜we can do it at a certain time and if youâ€™re in your position at a certain time, everythingâ€™ll be fineâ€™, and they gave me all sorts of help from a position point of view; and I could roam where I wanted to and photograph this play and the environment on this beautiful night in Athens. And I turned to my helper and I said, â€˜Well, you know, this sort of co-operation is more than I could ever expect, itâ€™s beautiful.â€™ I said, â€˜All we want now, just when weâ€™re taking these pictures, all we want now is for the full moon to rise through the Parthenonâ€™, joking, you see. And he said â€˜Well, Iâ€™ll see if I can arrange itâ€™, so I thought that was very funny. So there we were, taking these pictures, and the lights came on at the right time, and he tapped me on the shoulder and he pointed up and I looked up and there was the full moon, rising right through the Acropolis.\\n\\nI took some pictures at that point but that was not the one that was used â€“ but thatâ€™s often the way it goes.",

                            "In this book â€˜Australia and New Zealandâ€™ published by Life World Library, there are two colour pictures of Aboriginal children at Ernabella mission station. These children are of the Pitjantjatjara tribe and they have blond hair which tends to grow out in adolescence. And one afternoon we went out with about thirty of these children into the hills nearby, and as soon as we got there, the children virtually disappeared into the landscape, because theyâ€™re so sympathetic â€“ their forms and their colouring is so sympathetic to the rocks and the earth â€“ that you could hardly see the children in the landscape. The picture on page 114 tends to show this; the children are searching for rabbits and lizards and things in these marvellous rock forms.\\n\\nI found that these children [were] totally delightful, totally unsophisticated of course, genuine, happy, really beautiful kids. The light, of course, in this situation of photographing these children, was superb, it was bright low sun, and this accentuated this quality of fairness of hair that the children have, and the hair is very similar in colour and texture and the look of it in the picture, to the spinifex bushes which dot the landscape across the country there. But I find that whatever the light is, as a professional photographer you have to make it work for you one way or the other. There are certain things you would rather wait for and you have time to wait for, but very often the pressures are such that you just have to take it some way with what youâ€™re given, and make it work. And itâ€™s incredible how many times this can be done. I think that there was no problem in photographing these children â€“ the light was superb â€“ but to photograph them against the light so that the light is in fact coming through their hair, gives the hair more luminosity, more life, more movement.",

                            "Lewis Morley (1925â€“2013) established his reputation as one of the key British photographers of the 1960s and is known for his iconic image of a nude Christine Keeler straddling an Arne Jacobsen chair. He ran a highly successful studio above London's first satirical venue, the Establishment Club, where he formed important associations with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Barry Humphries and a range of as yet undiscovered young talents including Michael Caine who frequented the hip venue. Many of the faces he captured on film define the swinging sixties scene in London, including portraits of Charlotte Rampling, Vanessa Redgrave, Judy Dench, Jean Shrimpton and Peter O'Toole. He worked extensively for theatre and television, becoming sought after for his particular style of 'on location' and 'action' photography and portraiture. Migrating to Sydney in 1971, Morley found 'the sixties all over again'. Despite this, working in a new country in a new decade his work underwent a dramatic shift in approach to style and format. Shooting increasingly in colour for magazines such as _Dolly_, _POL_ and _Belle_, Morley's Australian work provides an evocative record of culture change through the 1970s and 1980s. Portraits from this era include images of Peter Carey, Brett Whiteley, Nicole Kidman, Marcia Hines, Sherbet and John Newcombe. The National Portrait Gallery held an exhibition of his work, _Myself and Eye_, in 2003; _Lewis Morley: 50 Years of Photography_ was staged at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2006."

                            "Thomas Sutcliffe Mort (1816-1878) was a merchant, shipbuilder, wool broker and pioneer of the technique of freezing meat for export. Mort arrrived in New South Wales from England in 1838, and by 1843 had extablished the colony's main wool auction house, Mort Company. He soon took on export consignments, stock and station agencies, railway promotion, mining and sugar cultivation. Successful pastoral investments in the 1850s financed his development of a large model dairy farm at Bodalla, NSW, where he also tried to grow cotton and silk. While rebuilding a Darling Point mansion, he established a dry dock at Balmain in the mid 1850s, where he progressed from shipbuilding to locomotive production and general engineering. This business became Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. in 1888, some 10 years after Mort's death. In 1875 Mort established the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company, which capitalised on refrigeration experiments he had funded between 1866 and 1878. The first consignments of frozen meat were shipped from Australia in 1870, the year after Mort died. The Morts were married in Sydney in 1841 and travelled to England in 1857."

Laidley served in the West Indies, Canada and Mauritius before taking up the position of Commissary General in Sydney, arriving with his family in 1827. In October 1841, Theresa married merchant, shipbuilder and wool broker Thomas Sutcliffe Mort (1816-1878). Five years later, Mort purchased land at Darling Point where the family home, Greenoaks, was built. Theresa and Thomas had eight children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. Their eldest son, Laidley James Mort was born at Greenoaks in 1843 and was later educated at Eton. Theresa was a devoted wife and mother and was also an amateur artist, taking lessons from Conrad Martens (who painted Greenoaks) in 1846 and 1847. Thomas Sutcliffe Mort's biographer has described Mort as having an 'immense love' for his wife and family; he is said to have been devastated at Theresa's death, aged 49, in 1869."

In January 1834, he married one of his students, Lavinia Lord (1816â€“1875), the eldest of the five daughters of Thomas and Susan Lord. He left Ellinthorp in 1838 and established himself in Launceston as an artist, his students having supplied a useful connection to the colonists most likely to commission portraits. In late 1840 he relocated to a farm near Little Swanport at his father-in-lawâ€™s instigation. But Mundyâ€™s attempt to make a living as a farmer failed, and by 1842 heâ€™d moved to Hobart, where he sought work as an artist with â€˜leisure for a few pupils who are desirous of instruction in painting, drawing or music.â€™ Mundy received favourable notice for his work and during the early 1840s completed a number of portrait commissions, but despite his â€˜excellent taste and professional abilityâ€™, his practice gradually declined and exacerbated his alcoholism and depression. He took an overdose of laudanum in a Hobart pub in March 1848, leaving Lavinia and five children to â€˜lament his untimely demiseâ€™."

                            "Arthur Murch, artist, is best-known as a painter in a colourful cubistic style, but he was occupied with sculpture throughout his career. Murch trained at Dattilo-Rubboâ€™s school between 1921 and 1925; meanwhile, in sculpture his most important teacher was Rayner Hoff. It was his sculpture that won him the 1925 Travelling Art Scholarship, which he spent most profitably in Italy. Later, his chief mentor was George Lambert, whom he assisted in Sydney from 1927 to 1930. At that time, Lambert was weakened by remnant malaria, and he greatly valued Murchâ€™s strength, calling him the â€˜pocket Herculesâ€™. They worked together on the figure for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in St Maryâ€™s Cathedral, and Murch completed the Henry Lawson Memorial after Lambert died in 1930. Other works Murch produced around the period of his association with Lambert include the memorial to Thorburn Brailsford Robertson in Adelaide University, and the Macarthur Onslow Memorial Light Horse Trophy. In 1933 he travelled with a scientific expedition to Hermannsburg, and he returned to the mission the following year. Many of his paintings reflect his interest in Indigenous culture and practises. In the late 1930s he was in the UK, and worked on the wool pavilion at the Glasgow Empire Exhibition. In 1941 he won the competition to execute the memorial relief in honour of Dame Nellie Melba in the Sydney Town Hall. During World War 2 he was an official war artist in the Northern Territory, working in Darwin and around the Adelaide River. Perhaps because his father was a carpenter-builder and he himself trained as an engineer, Murch sculpted in all imaginable media including fibreglass, rubber, pottery, stitched felt applique and cement - the latter when restoring Norman Lindsayâ€™s garden sculptures. He was a foundation member of the Australian Academy of Art; he won the Society of Artistsâ€™ Medal in 1935 and the Archibald Prize for 1949. The 1977 exhibition _Project 19: Arthur Murch_ at the Art Gallery of New South Wales was the first major survey of Murchâ€™s work by a public gallery. Now, the Art Gallery of New South Wales has many of his works; the Australian War Memorial has more than thirty of his paintings and drawings and he is represented in most Australian public galleries. The papers of Arthur Murch, collated by Ria Murch, are in the archive of the Art Gallery of New South Wales."

                            "Glenn Murcutt AO (b. 1936), architect, received the world's highest architectural honour when he was awarded the Pritzker Prize in April 2002. Having spent a good deal of his youth in New Guinea, where he learned to love simple shapes and materials, Murcutt only just scraped into a university architecture course at the University of New South Wales, graduating in 1961. As a student, he drew on principles he had learned while working for his father, who had a number of building businesses in Sydney after the war. Murcutt is unusual among Pritzker winners in that he works alone, mostly on residential homes; he has never made a skyscraper or a tourist attraction; and he uses mostly basic materials. By using shades, louvres, fully opening walls and carefully planned ventilation he enables his buildings to respond instantly to changing conditions and requirements. His overriding design philosophy is that dwellings should 'touch the earth lightly'. There are several books about his work, including _Leaves of Iron_ (1991) and _Touch This Earth Lightly_ (2000) by Philip Drew and _Glenn Murcutt: Buildings + Projects 1962â€“2003_ (2003) by FranÃ§oise Fromonot. Murcutt's Islamic Centre project, an unconventional mosque in suburban Melbourne, is at the heart of an intimate film about Murcutt by Catherine Hunter, _Glenn Murcutt: Spirit of Place_ (2016). He is a Professor at UNSW, and is the principle 'master' on the Architecture Foundation Australia annual International Architecture Master Classes."

                            "For me in architecture nature has a beautiful story. You look at the strength of our flora but also look at the delicacy at the same time. So thereâ€™s a strength and a delicacy. I love the idea of the legibility of the strength. I love the delicacy of the edges. And so in my work, I like to articulate that which is structure, that which is skin, that which is edge. These are things that are in nature in this part of the world and I have endeavoured in my career to try and understand this landscape of ours and be able to integrate these elements not in a determined way but in a very relaxed way. So that there is the articulation of elements without it being such that you are forced to look at it. I donâ€™t like an architecture that is saying to me, Look at me, look at me, look at me. I want an architecture thatâ€™s quiet, that reveals itself quietly, and the more you start to see it, the more you start to understand it.\\n\\nThe roots of architecture remain relevant. If you go beyond the roots of architecture, about space, about order, about structure, about understanding nature and structure â€¦ If you go and just do something for the sake of it, for example, youâ€™ll hear students talking about, Oh I wanted to do this and I wanted to do that. Thatâ€™s delinquent. What does the brief call for? What does the site call for? What does the economics call for? What does the structure call for, what are the materials available? These are the things â€“ itâ€™s not what I want. Itâ€™s what these things are asking to be addressed.\\n\\nI am very happy at the age of over 80 now still practising like mad and still enjoying it as I did as a young architect.",

                            "Graeme Murphy AO (b. 1950), choreographer and dancer, was co-artistic director of the Sydney Dance Company with his wife Janet Vernon AM for three decades. Born in Melbourne, Murphy grew up in Mole Creek, Tasmania, taking dance classes in Launceston. At age fourteen he was the youngest male dancer to be accepted into The Australian Ballet School in Melbourne; he commenced with The Australian Ballet three years later and choreographed his first ballet, _Ecco le Diavole_, in 1971. That year he received an Australia Council Grant to study overseas, studying with the Joffrey Ballet in New York, and dancing with the Royal Ballet in England and Les Ballets FÃ©lix Blaska in France. Back in Australia, he was appointed artistic director of the Sydney Dance Company (then known as The Dance Company NSW) in 1976, helping it to become one of Australia's most successful dance companies. His most popular piece is perhaps _Poppy_ (1978), a full-length ballet based on the life of Jean Cocteau, in which he danced the title role four years after announcing his retirement. In 2001 Murphy was presented with a Helpmann Award for _Body of Work: A Retrospective_; he won Australian Dance Awards for outstanding achievement in choreography for Tivoli in 2001 and Swan Lake in 2003. Named a Living National Treasure in 1999, Murphy retired from the Sydney Dance Company in 2007 after creating a repertoire of more than 50 works. Over the years he has also created productions for companies including Opera Australia, The Australian Ballet, Shanghai Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. His honours include the 2009 Best Choreography Green Room Award for _Firebird_ and the 2011 Fred & Adele Astaire Award for excellence in choreography for _Mao's Last Dancer_. He was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in June 2012 for his distinguished contribution to Australian dance. Murphy continues to direct and choreograph productions, including _Turandot_ (2019) and _The Merry Widow_ (2021) for Opera Australia."

                            "Dame Margery Merlyn Baillieu Myer DBE (1900â€“1982), philanthropist and fundraiser, was the daughter of a hotelier, George Baillieu. Born in Queenscliff, she grew up in Melbourne, where she met store-owner Sidney Myer in 1916. Eighteen years her senior, he had arrived in Victoria as Simca Baevski in 1898. Changing his name to Myer, he opened a sophisticated American-style department store, the Myer Emporium, on Bourke Street in 1911. Merlyn began an arts degree at the University of Melbourne, but was distracted by love, and in 1920 she and Myer (a divorcÃ©) married in San Francisco. Throughout the 1920s they moved between California and Melbourne. In 1929, with two sons and two daughters, they set up house at Cranlana, Toorak. As the company continued to expand, Sidney made generous contributions to cultural and charitable causes, but in 1934 he died. Merlyn plunged herself into the Myer Emporium and charitable work, administering the Sidney Myer Charitable Trust, which financed the Sidney Myer Music Bowl among many other projects. Along with her many Myer-related activities, she was for more than four decades a board member of the Royal Melbourne Hospital, engaging closely with patients and staff as well as fundraising, often at Cranlana, and making big donations herself. For her work on behalf of the Red Cross during the war, she was appointed OBE. She raised large sums for cancer and heart disease research and was a member or patron of many community welfare organisations. In 1960 she was promoted to DBE for her philanthropy. She also remained passionate about the Myer retail business and took a practical interest in the welfare of the store's employees. Between 1919 and 1981 she went overseas 144 times, and from 1942 she often retreated to her sheep and cattle property Booroola, but she remained a byword in Melbourne for elegance and generosity."

                            "Arrernte artist Albert Namatjira (1902â€“1959) is one of Australia's most celebrated and important artists. He is recognised as the first person to link Aboriginal art and culture with European painting techniques. Born at Hermannsburg (Ntaria) near Alice Springs, Namatjira had been making art for much of his life before becoming interested in watercolour painting in the 1930s. Exhibiting from 1938 to acclaim and working prolifically, demand for his paintings increased during the 1940s. Though famous by the 1950s, First Nations people were not recognised in the Australian constitution at this time and faced widespread prejudice and inequality. Namatjira met Queen Elizabeth II in Canberra in 1954, and was the first Aboriginal person to receive citizenship in 1957, but restrictions on his family and his community remained engrained and complex, ultimately leading to his death in 1959. His distinctive style, though seemingly taking on the appearance of Western landscape traditions is rooted in deep ancestral connection and knowledge of the lands spanning his fatherâ€™s country around the MacDonnell Ranges and his motherâ€™s country in the region of Palm Valley in Central Australia. The Gamatj clan leader Yunupingu AM leader has explained that in his work Namatjira was 'demonstrating to the rest of the world the living title held by his people to the lands they had been on for thousands of years'."

By the age of seventeen she was something of a muse to Sydney bohemians, and was courted by cricketer Keith Miller and artist Norman Lindsay. Arriving in London in the early 1950s, she initially lived on a Chelsea houseboat. When her brother Richard Neville arrived in London, she introduced him to people who helped launch the English incarnation of his magazine _Oz_, the first issues of which were published from her Bayswater home. Following early encouragement by the Canadian author Elizabeth Smart, in 1966 she published her first novel, _Fall-Girl_, which drew on her tumultuous relationships with the poets Peter Porter and Robert Lowell. Moving to Paris in about 1967, she published six more novels, the last three of which, _Last Ferry To Manly_, _Swimming the Channel_ and _The Day We Cut the Lavender_, formed a loose trilogy exploring the experience of individuals torn between Europe and Australia. Through the 1980s and early 1990s she was a regular reviewer for the _Independent_, the _Times Literary Supplement_, the _Observer_, _London Magazine_ and the _Australian_. She also wrote _The Poet and the Goddess_, a play about Robert Graves and Laura Riding staged in 1995 at Oxford, the Cheltenham Festival and the Everyman Theatre, Hampstead. A warm friend and a generous critic, Neville was married three times, the last time to the geneticist Lewis Wolpert."

                            "Jinx Nolan (b. 1941), artist, is the daughter of writer Cynthia Reed and the adopted daughter of Sidney Nolan, whom Reed married in 1948. Jinx was nine when she asked Nolan if he would teach her to draw: believing that art couldn't be taught, Nolan apparently just gave her a pencil and some paper and said 'Now draw'. Despite this, her childhood travels in Central Australia with her family encouraged her love of art, and when she eventually went to art school, at age 30, Nolan told her that 'You either have it or you donâ€™t â€“ and you have it'. After the family's move to Europe in the early 1950s, Jinx spent several years at an English boarding school and later attended finishing schools in Paris and Lausanne. She was seventeen when they moved to the United States. She studied French and music at Bennington College, Vermont, and subsequently found work with the United Nations in New York. After moving to Boston in the early 1970s she started studying art at evening college but later went on to study full-time in printmaking and fine art. Following her mother's death in 1976, Jinx temporarily relocated to London and then returned to Australia to be with her stepfather. She returned to the USA following Nolan's death in 1992. Still based in Boston, Jinx continues to paint abstract landscapes, holding a solo exhibition in Sydney in 2017."

                            "Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920â€“1993), formerly Kath Walker, was a Quandamooka woman, activist, poet, writer and educator. Born in Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island) in Queensland, she enlisted in the Australian Women's Army Service in 1942 before beginning her career in political activism. In the 1940s she was a member of the Communist Party of Australia, which opposed racial discrimination. She became Queensland State Secretary of the Federal Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advancement in 1961, and campaigned successfully for amendments to Sections 51(xxvi) and 127 of the Constitution in 1967. In the 1970s she chaired a number of bodies set up to promote Indigenous interests, including the Queensland Aboriginal Advancement League. Throughout her life, she aimed to promote cultural pride among Aboriginal people through her writing, which she described as 'sloganistic, civil rightish, plain and simple'. Her first book of poetry, _We are Going_, published in 1964, was the first poetry publication by an Aboriginal person. Noonuccal returned to Minjerribah in 1971 where she taught Aboriginal culture to thousands of school children, and published two children's books: _Stradbroke Dreamtime_ (1972) and _Father Sky and Mother Earth_ (1981). Having gained world acclaim for her writing and advocacy (for which she was also conferred with four honorary doctorates), she published her last collection of poems, _Kath Walker in China_, in 1988. That year, she reassumed her tribal name in protest at the Bicentennial celebrations, and returned the MBE she had been awarded in 1970."

                            "In 1965 I think it was, we were invited to go in and talk to the then prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies. There was a deputation from all over Australia of Aboriginal spokesmen and women and we did go in. Sir Robert Menzies had told the public and the politicians, the people of the House, that he would not have a referendum in his lifetime as prime minister. Heâ€™d been badly beaten on the referendum before where he had appealed to the people to outlaw Communism and when the people said â€˜No outlawing of the Communist Partyâ€™, Sir Robert Menzies refused then to have anything to do with referendums in his lifetime as prime minister.\\n\\nWe lobbied the House of Parliament and itâ€™s to their discredit, really, that when we asked them to bring out the laws concerning the Aboriginal people that there was no laws, no books on the Aboriginal people in their archives or libraries, and they had to quickly have them printed, so that the politicians could read what it was, for and against the Aborigines. There was one, however, on the national â€“ the Canberra law book saying that if Aboriginals go into Canberra, any Justice of the Peace could declare them illegal immigrants into Canberra and they could be chased out of Canberra. This still applied to us, incidentally, at this period of time. And we always made a joke of it when we went to Canberra, you know, â€˜If you get into trouble, you know the law on the book. If a JP says Get Out, make sure you get your blanket,â€™ because the law still said that before sending them out of Canberra, they must first issue them with one government blanket. So we were determined weâ€™d get our government blanket if ever they threw us out.  \\nWe told everyone this and we made it a laughingstock â€“ Canberra a laughingstock â€“ to such an extent that the first thing Sir Robert Menzies did was delete that off the Canberra constitution. So itâ€™s no longer there.",

                            "I would say that the majority of the Australian people voted Yes in favour of the Aboriginal people merely to clear their guilty conscience. Itâ€™s easy to put a mark on a ballot paper, and I must say this definitely, that there was a small minority group of sincere Australian people but I would say 75 [per cent] of those who voted Yes did it to clear their guilty conscience.\\n\\nIncidentally, itâ€™s interesting to understand why those terrible discriminative laws were put into the books. In the first place, our civic fathers, or the white manâ€™s civic fathers of long ago, during the â€˜soothing of the dying pillowâ€™ era, the politicians, or the statesmen of that time, were writing over to Queen Victoria saying, â€˜The Aborigine is dying out.â€™ And true, he was â€“ they were poisoning him with strychnine in the waterholes and they were shooting him, and they were doing all sorts of things. And the Aborigine dropped from 300,000 strong to 80,000 in a very short period of time. So it was quite natural for them to say the Aborigine was a dying race.\\n\\nNow it was during this period of time that the Constitution was being fixed, and as they thought we were a dying race, to save themselves a lot of bother they said, â€˜Well we will not count the Aborigines and we do not have to make laws for the Aborigines, because theyâ€™re going to die out anywayâ€™. And this is the reason today why Aboriginals have not had any education, any decent housing, any facilities that the white Australian enjoys today. Itâ€™s because of that stupid business of thinking the Aboriginals were going to die out.\\n\\nMind you, the Aboriginals are a determined lot, and theyâ€™re quite ungrateful. They didnâ€™t die, they lived on and are still living on; in spite of the many attempts to commit genocide and assassinate us all, we are still here. I think weâ€™ll last the white man out, truly.",

                            "Dr Lowitja Oâ€™Donoghue AC CBE DSG (1932â€“2024), a Yankunytjatjara woman, dedicated her lifeâ€™s work to advancing the rights and wellbeing of Australiaâ€™s First Peoples. Born at Indulkana in the APY Lands in South Australia, she was removed from her mother at the age of two and raised in a childrenâ€™s home run by missionaries at Quorn in the Flinders Ranges. She recollects that she became rebellious at a young age after hearing her culture being denigrated. â€˜I was always asking the question about who am I, where did I come from, whoâ€™s my mother and whoâ€™s my father, and where are they? Never got any answers to any of that at all,â€™ she says. At 16 she got a job as a nanny. Encouraged to become a nurse, she applied for a traineeship and was â€“ eventually â€“ accepted, becoming the first Aboriginal woman to complete her nursing training at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. She worked there until the early 1960s, and also travelled to remote communities, learning about her heritage through â€˜just doing what I could to heal peopleâ€™. She joined the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1967 and by 1975 she had become its regional director in South Australia. In 1977 she was elected Foundation Chair of the National Aboriginal Conference, formed under prime minister Malcolm Fraser as a peak body to advise the Federal government on Indigenous affairs, and she chaired the Aboriginal Development Commission from 1989 to 1990. Named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1983, she was Australian of the Year in 1984, and in 1999 she was named a Companion of the Order of Australia. In 2005 she was invested by Pope John Paul II as a Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great. While Chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission between 1990 and 1996, she helped to draft the Mabo legislation. The holder of six honorary doctorates, she was the patron of the Lowitja Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research. In 2022, on her 90th birthday, the Lowitja Institute formed the Lowitja Oâ€™Donoghue Foundation to continue and preserve her legacy."

So, Iâ€™m not sure that he knew much about [the] Stolen Generation. After I saw the portrait come out, I myself felt the portrait wasnâ€™t like me because Robert had told me very early in the piece that I wasnâ€™t to smile. He doesnâ€™t like smiling portraits. People who know me of course know that I do smile a lot.\\n\\nThe suit that I wore on the day, I think he was a bit surprised because it was really quite formal and itâ€™s a suit that I wear when I receive the many awards that Iâ€™ve received over the years. My family had no difficulty at all seeing me turn up in that same suit. And because it was a portrait, I thought, well, you know, Iâ€™m an Aboriginal woman and Iâ€™m going to wear the Aboriginal flag, and Iâ€™m going to wear everything red, black and yellow.\\n\\nIâ€™m much more proud of the fact that Iâ€™m a nurse and that I was able to use my nursing experience to actually travel to remote areas in my own, well in my own right, just doing what I could to heal people. I didnâ€™t know my people very well and so on, this is one way of getting to know them out on the APY lands. I have had a lot of senior jobs, met just so many people in high places, really. And I enjoyed seeing them but they werenâ€™t the most important things in my life. It was really about making a difference.",

                            "Margaret Olley AC (1923-2011), painter, studied art at East Sydney Technical College and the Grande ChaumiÃ¨re in Paris. She was well known in the Sydney post war art scene and her portrait was painted by Drysdale and Dobell â€“ Dobellâ€™s painting won the 1948 Archibald Prize. Olley held her first one-person show that year. It was a sellout, and she held at least one solo exhibition annually from then on. In 1991 she reprised her success of 43 years before, when a show of thirty-five of her intimate, brilliantly coloured interiors and still lifes sold out again. The Art Gallery of New South Wales held a major retrospective show of her long career in 1996/7. Olley remained one of Sydneyâ€™s best-known arts identities to her death, curating an exhibition with Barry Humphries called â€˜Favouritesâ€™ at the SH Ervin Gallery in 2002, continuing to paint, and posing for numerous portraits by younger artists she encouraged, including Nicholas Harding and Ben Quilty. In the 1980s she endowed the Margaret Hannah Olley Art Trust, of which several Australian galleries, including the National Portrait Gallery, have been beneficiaries. Quiltyâ€™s portrait of Olley won the Archibald Prize in 2011. Tweed River Art Gallery is home to the Margaret Olley Art Centre which includes a reproduction of Olleyâ€™s studio and living space."

                            "I have many ways of working. One is working directly from a model or from using a still life. This I donâ€™t arrange and then paint it immediately; I always have a very definite idea what I want to do. Sometimes it doesnâ€™t come off immediately, sometimes it does, and this is a very satisfying thing. Other times I paint say for a whole day, and then leave it for several weeks; it might go on for months or even six weeks, taking out something, repainting again.\\n\\nI very rarely make a detailed sketch of what I intend to do. I might make little thumbnail notes but never very detailed, because I feel you kill the painting you want to do.\\n\\nPainting to me is like drawing; you draw with your brush or your palette knife, so whether one is using a paintbrush or watercolour or a pen, itâ€™s all creative, and I never mind which medium Iâ€™m using.\\n\\nThe paintings I do are naturally things I â€“ Iâ€™m inspired whether itâ€™s the colour, the shape; it might be the colour of the skin of a native woman, it doesnâ€™t matter.\\n\\nI can hear myself saying things that are so trite, and theyâ€™re not really how I want to say them. This is a dreadful thing for a painter. We say it in paint, otherwise weâ€™d be a writer or perhaps a musician, who knows?",

                            "John Olsen AO (b. 1945), diplomat and former politician, grew up in South Australia and began his public career as its youngest-ever mayor, assuming that office in Kadina in 1974. In 1976 he became the youngest-ever president of the South Australian Liberal Party. Having been elected member for Rocky River in 1979, he led the opposition in South Australia from 1982 to 1990, when he was appointed to the Federal Senate. In 1992 he returned to the South Australian parliament as the member for Kavel; four years later he became South Australian premier. During his premiership he encouraged investment in the economically beleaguered state and pressed for corporatisation and privatisation of government services; in particular, he is associated with water management and recycling initiatives that boosted production in the Barossa and elsewhere. He resigned from office in 2001 following an enquiry established to investigate a government contract. From 2002 to 2006 he was Australiaâ€™s consul-general in Los Angeles, in which capacity he initiated the enduringly successful Australia Week, a significant driver of American tourism, trade and investment in Australia. Subsequently, until 2009, he was consul-general in New York. Currently chair of the American Australian Association Ltd and a member of the board of the US Studies Centre at the University of New South Wales, in mid-2017 he became the president of the South Australian Liberal Party for the second time."

                            "Sir Alexander Campbell Onslow (1842-1908), judge, was educated at Cambridge and practised law in England before being appointed attorney general of British Honduras in 1878. In 1880, he arrived in Western Australia, then under the governorship of William Robinson, to become attorney general there. Suffering ill health almost from the day he arrived, he took his seat as chief justice in 1883. By 1884 he had severely antagonised the new governor, Broome. Tensions between them involving interpretation of Colonial Office instructions escalated until, in 1887, Broome interdicted Onslow from the exercise of his office. Onslow became a hero to anti-government factions, who burned Broome in effigy and were jubilant when the Colonial Office lifted Onslow's suspension. He returned to the bench in May 1888, but fell into another imbroglio when the proprietors of the West Australian and the Western Mail accused him of open prejudice against them. Broome held an inquiry in Executive Council, at which Onslow defended himself, but there was no outcome. After other avenues of inquiry were canvassed unsuccessfully, the matter was passed to the Legislative Council, which found that Onslow's occupancy of his present position was an impediment to 'peace and harmony' in the colony. Onslow took nearly a year's leave. However, he returned to the bench in 1891, welcomed by the reinstated Robinson and a conciliatory West Australian. Throughout his remaining years in office, he discharged his duties competently. Retiring in ill health in 1901, he returned to England for the last seven years of his life."

Trained as an art teacher, Orr began exhibiting at the Ewing and George Paton Gallery at Melbourne University in the late 1970s. Since then, her work has been shown in numerous solo and group exhibitions in Australia and overseas, including in Paris, Beijing, Amsterdam, New York, Toronto, Bern, Venice, and Hong Kong. A key figure in the performance art movement in Australia, she is known in particular for performance works and installations examining social and political issues, environmentalism, gender and the relationship between identity and place. Currently Senior Lecturer in Visual Art & Performance at Federation University, Ballarat, Orr has an MA from RMIT and attained her PhD for Monash University in 2012. Her work is represented in many public collections, including those of the NGA and the NGV, and has featured in major survey exhibitions including _Know My Name_ (NGA 2020-2021), _Every Brilliant Eye: Australian Art of the 1990s_ (NGV 2017), and _Lurid Beauty: Australian Surrealism and its echoes_ (NGV 2015)."

                            "Russell Page (1968â€“2002), choreographer, dancer and actor, was from the Nunukul (Noonuccal) people and the Munaldjali clan of the Yugambeh people of south-east Queensland. The youngest of twelve children, he grew up in the working-class Brisbane suburb of Mt Gravatt. He was a skilled rugby league player, chosen to play for the Queensland Zone side, but at the age of sixteen he chose instead to follow his brother to study at the National Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Association's Dance College in Sydney. Overcoming his initial rebellion at the discipline of dance, he quickly became 'pure spirit' in performance, equally breathtaking as an earth-bound or aerial dancer. With brothers Stephen, an artistic director, and David, a composer, he was a founder of the Bangarra Dance Theatre, and was its principal artist from 1991. Page occasionally took time to dance with other companies, including the Australian Dance Theatre in Adelaide and the Aboriginal and Islander Dance Theatre in Sydney. He was also a seasoned television and film performer, appearing in the feature film _Kick_, the contemporary opera _Black River_, ABC TV's _Poison_, Tracy Moffatt's film _Bedevil_ and Christine Anu's _Wanem Time_. He represented Australia at the 1997 Venice Biennale and appeared in the opening and closing ceremonies of the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000. The Bangarra production _Walkabout_ received typically ecstatic reviews from critics, with Page's solo singled out for special praise. He tragically passed away shortly after the close of the Sydney season of _Walkabout_ in July 2002, leaving his family, his three children, and Australian art, dance and Aboriginal communities mourning an irreplaceable loss."

                            "Josonia Palaitis trained as an art teacher in Sydney in the early 1970s, and experimented with diverse painting styles before settling into the photorealist mode for which she became best known. Her first solo exhibition was in 1981, by which time she had exhibited in both the Archibald and Portia Geach competitions. She has won the Peopleâ€™s Choice Award of the Archibald three times, with portraits of Paul Lyneham (1992), Bill Leak (1995) and Patrick Dodson (1998), and she won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize in 1994 with a portrait of her father, veteran _Womenâ€™s Weekly_ illustrator John Mills. Palaitis had painted John Howard for the Archibald Prize competition of 1979, and otherwise knew the Howards slightly as their children had been at the same preschool. When she was chosen for the commission, the three met at Kirribilli House to discuss her conception of the work. As she took many informal snaps of them in different areas of the grounds, the interaction between the artist and her subjects became freer. Unlike many portraitists, Palaitis is happy to show her sitters the work as it evolves from photographs to watercolour studies to the final canvas, and the Howards viewed it several times over the course of the 650 hours it took her to paint in her studio. In response to media and public interest in the work, Palaitis maintained that â€˜foremost in my mind was to portray, in whatever way, a sense of relationship between the coupleâ€™, whom she found â€˜sincere and unpretentiousâ€™."

                            "Ambrose Patterson (1877-1967) was a printmaker, painter and teacher. Like Ramsay, Patterson studied under Bernard Hall at the National Gallery School. Travelling to Europe between 1898 and 1899, he continued his studies and returned to Australia via visits to Canada and the United States. In 1901 he returned to Europe, staying until 1910 under the sponsorship of Dame Nellie Melba, to whom he was related by marriage and who wished him to 'work and be a gentlemen without financial restraints'. During this time he became acquainted with Hugh Ramsay, with whom he shared a Paris studio, and who was to have an important influence on his work, particularly his self-portraiture. Patterson's widow recalled 'I don't need to say that my Husband looked on Ramsay as an exceptional artist - in fact, I know he felt he was the Australian artist whose work he most admired'. In 1915 Patterson travelled to Honolulu before migrating to the USA, where he taught and lectured at the University of Washington Art School from 1919 to 1947. He died in Seattle, having visited Australia for the last time in 1951."

Peck layers visual motifs that challenge dichotomies; addressing complex concepts of identity, culture, innocence, power; and the place of the individual within a pluralist society. Peck's hyper-real painting frequently intersects with street art aesthetics, post-apocalyptic imagery, nineteenth century photographic landscape and portraiture formats, and recently, patterning from luxury interior and textile designs.\\n\\nPeck won the National Gallery of Victoria's Trustees Award in 1998 and the Metro Art Award in 2005. A finalist in the 2010 Dobell Drawing Prize and the 2012 Archibald Prize, he was awarded a highly commended in the Doug Moran National Portrait prize the same year. In 2013 Peck won the People's Choice Nillumbik Art Prize, Melbourne and in 2014 he was a finalist for both the John Leslie Landscape Art Prize and the Tattersall's Landscape Art Prize. Peck is also a three-time Sulman prize finalist, in 2013, 2014 and in 2017 â€“ with the striking work _Therefore I am_.\\n\\nIn 2015 Peck exhibited _Recruit #6_ and _Recruit (Self Portrait in the image of my son)_, both created in 2012, in the National Portrait Galleryâ€™s exhibition _In the Flesh_. He has also worked on large scale public art and mural formats across Australia and internationally. Peckâ€™s work is held in collections throughout Australia, and in London, New York and Hong Kong."

                            "Christine Audrey Pecket (1908â€“1996), artist, was three years old when her family emigrated to Sydney from Yorkshire. Two years after arriving in Australia, Pecket contracted polio, which left her partially paralysed and reliant on crutches and leg braces for the rest of her life. Despite this and being from a large, working-class family with little interest in art, Pecket was determined to become an artist. 'Disabilities are supposed to take everything from life, to leave it hollow and empty,' she said in a 1937 interview, 'but they don't. They make you try all the harder. One makes up one's mind to succeed despite the odds, and one does.' From around 1934, and with financial assistance from the NSW Society for Crippled Children, Pecket studied full-time at East Sydney Technical College, undertaking courses in drawing, printmaking, painting and modelling. Her solo exhibition at the college in 1937 featured more than 60 works and included etchings, drawings, watercolours and mural designs along with oil paintings. Having completed her diploma, Pecket established a studio in Castlereagh Street, Sydney, where she initially painted and taught art. Subsequently, during the 1940s and early 1950s, she produced and sold a range of decorative ceramics under her own label, Christine Ware. In 1955, she bought a house in Cammeray, where she established a home studio and returned to painting and teaching. She published an autobiography, _Some facets of my life_, in 1976."

                            "Clif Peir (b.1905) was a Sydney painter and teacher, who studied at the Julian Ashton School under Ashton and H.C.Gibbons. He was President of the Australian Art Society in 1951, and later a member of the Royal Art Society of NSW and the St George Art Society. From 1950 onward he travelled extensively in Central Australia, and throughout the sixties painted views of desert landscapes and Aboriginal people. In the early sixties he taught art at evening classes at Sutherland School, and also worked sporadically as an art critic for the Mirror newspaper group and a broadcaster for the BBC in London. However, his principal employment was producing advertising material for the Sydney County Council. He held many solo and group shows in Sydney from 1960 onward, and won municipal art awards in Kogarah, Campbelltown and Rockdale. In 1970 his work was featured in an 'Art Sale for Land Rights' at Paddington Town Hall with proceeds going to the New South Wales, Kimberley and North Queensland Aboriginal Land Councils. He is represented in the Art Gallery of New South Wales; the National Library; the Newcastle Art Gallery; the Howard Collection (Armidale); the Sutherland Shire Council; the National Bank in Adelaide; the Commonwealth Advisory Board; and in private collections in Australia and abroad."

                            "I started painting out of doors directly from something that I could see, and tried to get, even in those days, what I felt about them. Sometimes I would, of course, sketch, mostly with pencil, and where portraits were concerned, directly on the canvas with paint. Later on, after coming back from England, I used to make more sketches but I did my painting, the actual portrait, directly from the sitter. In those days you could get a sitter to sit still but nowadays they donâ€™t sit still, they want everything done in a hurry so that the method has to change. It takes very much longer to paint a portrait than it used to, simply because you canâ€™t get your sitter.\\n\\nIn my _Portrait of Richard_, [a] schoolboy about 12 years of age, I remember that I painted him or drew him in, first of all, with terre verte and then painted directly in colour. It took me about three weeks. He came and stayed with me and so we worked every day.\\n\\nIn a portrait I try to get the character as well as the outside resemblance of the sitter, to get the feeling, because that would be your feeling of the sitter; it wouldnâ€™t be the sitterâ€™s feeling of you, fortunately. In this particular case I was very fortunate. Itâ€™s a portrait of my nephew and he was very co-operative indeed.",

                            "Arthur Phillip (1738â€“1814), first governor of New South Wales, began his career while a boy in London. Educated at the Charity School of the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich, he was apprenticed to a whaler before serving as a powdermonkey in the Battle of Minorca and, later, a lieutenant in the Siege of Havana. Over the ensuing years he lived in France, served in the Portuguese Navy in Brazil from 1775 to 1778, commanded the Europe in the Bay of Bengal and spent time in Cape Town before returning to France. According to a recent biography by Michael Pembroke, over this period he engaged in espionage for the British. Endorsed by Even Nepean, under-secretary of the Home Office, in October 1786 Phillip was appointed to establish a colony on the east coast of Australia (before the French did). It was largely down to his meticulous planning that the First Fleet â€“ comprising eleven ships, 1500 people and two yearsâ€™ worth of supplies â€“ arrived at Sydney Cove in January 1788 at all. However, in the four years of his governorship convicts and officers alike felt intensely isolated and uncertain, and experienced critical shortages of food. As an Enlightenment man, he persisted in his hopes for the colony, always envisaging more than a convict settlement, insisting on equal distribution of rations and generally emphasising the desirability of peaceful relationships with Sydneyâ€™s Indigenous people (â€˜Any man who takes the life of a Native, will be put on his trial as if he had killed one of the Garrison. This appears to me not only just, but good policyâ€™, he wrote.) He contributed to early plans for the layout of Sydney and initiated farming at Parramatta before leaving the colony because of illness. He returned to naval duties in the late 1790s, becoming a rear admiral of the Blue and inspector of the Sea Fencibles. By the time he died, to be buried in a small church in Bathampton, he was a full Admiral of the blue, the highest of the nine ranks of admiral."

I have always found the natives friendly, and still retain the opinion I first formed of those people, that they do not betray a confidence placed in them.\\n\\nIn December 1788, one of the natives was seized for the purpose of learning the language and reconciling them to us, as mentioned in my former letter to your lordship, none of the natives having for some months come near the settlement. The man who was taken for that purpose appeared to be about 24 years of age and in three months was so reconciled that he was freed from all restraint and lived with me perfectly satisfied with his situation.\\n\\nIn the beginning of the following April, numbers of the natives were found dead with the smallpox in different parts of the harbour. It is not possible to determine the number of natives who were carried off by this fatal disorder; it must be great. And judging from the information of the native now living with us, and who had recovered from the disorder before he was taken, one half of those who inhabit this part of the country died. And as the natives always retired from where the disorder appeared and which some must have carried with them, it must have been spread to a considerable distance, as well as inland as along the coast. We have seen traces of it wherever we have been.\\n\\nThat they have some idea of a future state appears from their belief in spirits and from saying that the bones of the dead are in the chase, but the body in the clouds. And the question has been asked, do the white men go thither?",

American-born West, a noted portrait painter who succeeded Sir Joshua Reynolds as President of the Royal Academy in 1792, found Phillips employment on the windows of St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. On canvas, Phillips started out working in landscape and history painting, first exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1792. By 1796, he was primarily occupied with portraits and his reputation and demand as a portrait painter rivalled that of artists such as Thomas Lawrence and John Hoppner. He became a member of the Royal Academy in 1808, and in 1824, he succeeded Henry Fuseli as professor of painting at the Academy school. Among Phillips's portrait subjects are many eighteenth-century British luminaries, including William Blake, Sir Joseph Banks, Lord Byron, and Michael Faraday. His works are held in major public collections in Britain, Australia and the United States."

He also illustrated books and drew cartoons for the Daily Telegraph, where he was the regular art critic. Pidgeon became well known as a portrait painter, entering the Archibald Prize consistently between 1949 and the 1970s and winning it three times - in 1958, 1961, and in 1968 with a portrait of his friend and neighbour Lloyd Rees.

                            "Well, at [the] present moment Iâ€™m still painting portraits, most of them commissions. It means that you can be interested in people you are painting; doesnâ€™t necessarily follow that youâ€™re always interested in the particular job youâ€™re doing, although you make the best of it you can. Some sitters are more sympathetic than others and if you get no co-operation from a sitter it makes it very heavy going. However, you try to make the most of the composition and take some other interest in it.\\n\\nI think that my attitude to a portrait has to be reasonably objective, itâ€™s impossible to get rid of the artistâ€™s subjectivity altogether and necessarily one person sees another person in a slightly different light to what the next one would, and that does always condition your choice of position and your choice of light and your choice of angle and of expression that youâ€™ll put on a sitter. Nevertheless, I still, in a portrait, like to get more information about the sitter than I do about the artist who painted it. I think the work can be a work of art and yet be reasonably objective.\\n\\nBut Iâ€™ve had the experience that if I put what I thought was a reasonably amiable expression on a personâ€™s face and it seems to be an amiable person to me and the family accept that, to somebody else itâ€™s a supercilious smirk just because they donâ€™t like the person in any case, so that to the beholder all things are true. So that by this type of objectivity, youâ€™re not completely bound down to the limitations of pure subjectivity which emphasises and underlines one personâ€™s relation to the object at which heâ€™s looking.",

In the winter of that year, Peter Booth, Dale Hickey, Robert Hunter and Robert Rooney were some of the artists represented in a group show of large works at Pinocotheca; Paul Partos showed there later. Similar in sensibility and physical space to a New York SoHo loft, the gallery showed artists interested in post-object, conceptual and other non-traditional art forms. Aside from Legge and Watters in Sydney, it was the only gallery in Australia showing experimental work in the late 1960s and 1970s. Amongst the more than 300 artists who showed there were Rosalie Gascoigne, James Gleeson, Bill Henson, Tim Johnson, Tony Tuckson and Stelarc. Purposely, there was little documentation accompanying exhibitions."

                            "Peter Porter OAM (1929-2010), poet and critic, moved from Brisbane to London in 1951 at age 22. His work as an advertising copywriter influenced his early poetry, lucidly evoking the culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s. British poet Stephen Spender described Porter's mind as 'immensely fertile, lively, informed, honest and penetrating'. Porter's first collection of poems, Once Bitten, Twice Bitten, was published in Britain in 1961. The death of his wife in 1974 gave rise to the poetry collection The Cost of Seriousness (1978). Porter's straddling of Australian and English culture remained central to his work, evoking urban and natural worlds. In 1990 Porter was awarded the Gold Medal of Australian Literature, and in 2002, the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry."

                            "I usually write with fair facility, that is to say, it goes straight down, but I do a considerable amount of revision afterwards. However, the thing which is most interesting to me about the process of writing is what particularly moves you to write on a, say, a theme or a particular purpose. Well, with me itâ€™s rather like something sticking into me, something will get into my mind, and since I observe this much of a method that I have a set of notebooks which I work in, Iâ€™m usually working in, say, four notebooks at once and approaching from one end and from the other end, moving towards the middle, so that I have sort of places where I am working, like a workshop, like a sculptor might have his workshop where he has still got a piece, say, unfinished which he is working on. I have poems which are in unfinished states, which I keep going back to, and every time I get an idea for a poem I just put it in a margin and return to it. The one thing I do believe in is often choosing deliberately a particular external form before you actually choose your poem, though over the years Iâ€™ve tended to write more free verse poems, but I still like returning to poems in set forms and recently Iâ€™ve been writing a whole batch of sonnets.\\n\\nI also try to use different forms and to attempt things which I havenâ€™t done before, but mostly itâ€™s ideas, I suppose. Iâ€™m probably an impure poet, I believe in impure poetry, Iâ€™m not interested in lyrical qualities for themselves. What interests me in poetry is the confrontation of certain sorts of language, and therefore I like to be able to use many different styles, many different ways of doing things. I neither like to be particularly modern nor particularly traditional. In my view, the best poets are those who, starting from a traditional basis, widen the language by their own imagination.",

                            "Margaret Preston (1875-1963) trained at the NGV School and the Adelaide School of Design before leasing a studio and beginning to teach in Adelaide. After travel studies in Germany, France and Spain between 1904 and 1907 she returned to Adelaide to take on an increased teaching load. In 1912 she went to London, spending seven years there and in Europe before marrying and setting up house in the Sydney harbourside suburb of Mosman in 1920. Based there for the rest of her life, though travelling extensively, she campaigned vigorously on behalf of modern art while bringing forth a large body of robust paintings and prints. Preston was one of the first artists to recognise the significance and aesthetic power of Indigenous Australian art, the influence of which can be seen in some of her own work. She also saw the beauty in the native flowers and trees from which contemporaries such as Thea Proctor recoiled. Since the 1980s, many of her works have numbered amongst the most recognisable images of Australian art. The major Art Gallery of New South Wales retrospective, Margaret Preston: Art and Life toured in 2005."

                            "Clifton Pugh AO was one of Australiaâ€™s best-known artists of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and one of its leading advocates for the arts. Born in Richmond, he grew up in Melbourne, moving to Adelaide as a teenager. There, while waiting to enlist, he attended evening classes at the South Australian School of Art. After serving with the AIF, and then for a year in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, he returned to Australia to pursue a career as an artist. Under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Scheme, he attended classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, training under Sir William Dargie. Although a favourite of Dargieâ€™s, soon after completing his course Pugh did away with tonalism, developing a style that is at once expressionistic and figurative, seeking to fuse successfully the rival approaches to painting the virtues of which the arts community debated so passionately in the 1950s. In 1959 he was one of seven artists who signed the Antipodean Manifesto. As Pughâ€™s popularity grew, so too did the demand for a portrait by him, which increased with his second and third Archibald victories in 1971 and 1972. Reluctant to accept commissions for portraits, he preferred to paint people with whom he had developed some degree of spiritual, intellectual or imaginative connection. These came to include some of Australiaâ€™s leading artists, philanthropists and academics. Pugh is now best remembered, however, for his portraits of politicians; his own deep interest in the arts and politics emerged publicly in his chairmanship of the Arts and Cultural Policy Committee of the Victorian Branch of the ALP from 1971. Once described as a court painter to the Australian Labor Party, he portrayed many of its key figures, including Gough Whitlam, Don Dunstan, Clyde Cameron, Clyde Holding, Lionel Murphy and Tom Uren. Yet, moved by various impulses, he also completed portraits of other politicians and statesmen, amongst them Harold Holt, John McEwen, Viscount de Lâ€™Isle, the Duke of Edinburgh and Sir John Kerr."

                            "There was a wild herd of kangaroos in the bush around us, and of course I was very intrigued. I used to creep up and sit down and watch them playing around me. But always very upset because whenever they were aware of me, theyâ€™d gallop off, and I used to feel, if I could let them know that Iâ€™m not going to harm them. But perhaps because of other human beings they were scared. And my feeling the whole time was, if I could only get the birds and animals to realise that Iâ€™m not going to harm them.\\n\\nI saw one kangaroo had been shot and I was really upset about this and I used to go back and look at this â€“ remains. Then I got a shock the following spring, that the animal had practically disintegrated, but out of that area where this animal had died, there were these most beautiful orchids. And that gave me the realisation of this continuing cycle, is that this kangaroo had to die to produce something in the soil that produced these orchids, because they werenâ€™t anywhere else, they were just in this one spot. So all the paintings from then on, right up â€˜til halfway through â€™64, were of birds and animals, and this continuing cycle, always the paintings took the form, organic form of a movement, you could almost call it like a circle, â€˜til this trip came up to the north-west, up to the Kimberleys. There I had a very, very big change of feeling. As I said before, I felt myself not belonging to the world â€“ we were some mistake. Going up there, I felt myself starting to belong for the very first time, and itâ€™s made a big change to the paintings, because now Iâ€™m painting human beings, theyâ€™re in all the paintings Iâ€™m doing, because for the first time perhaps, at the age of 40, Iâ€™m feeling myself starting to belong in the world, that is, the world in its total stage, not just human beings and animals but all being one.",

Purves began his career as a manufacturer's agent, and spent eighteen years running a successful dress-pattern manufacturing business with his wife. He managed the business aspects of the Australian Galleries, while Anne dealt with the art. As a team, they pioneered professional dealing in Australian contemporary art, promoting the careers of artists including Sidney Nolan, John Perceval, Albert Tucker, Jeffrey Smart and Brett Whiteley. John Brack began exhibiting with them in 1957. The following year he painted their portraits - as well as one of his friend, Fred Williams.

                            "Peter Purves Smith (1912â€“1949), artist, went to Geelong Grammar with his lifelong friend Russell Drysdale. He worked as a jackaroo for three years before undertaking art studies at the Grosvenor School in London. Back in Melbourne, he studied at the George Bell School where he met Maisie Mathews, who later became his wife. In 1938, Purves Smith left for Europe, where he painted major works including _Kangaroo Hunt_, acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, New York. He was an imaginative and inventive painter; the elongated figures and surrealist elements that Drysdale was to extend in representations of the Australian landscape were present in Purves Smith's paintings in the late 1930s and early 1940s. After proposing to Maisie, who had returned to Australia, Purves Smith joined the British Army in 1940 and served in West Africa and Burma until he was hospitalised with tuberculosis. He and Maisie married in 1946 in Melbourne, with Drysdale as best man; Purves Smith died following surgery to relieve his symptoms in 1949, at the age of 37."

                            "Hugh Ramsay (1877-1906), painter, was born in Scotland but arrived in Australia as a baby. He grew up in a mansion in what is now Essendon and studied at the NGV school from 1894 to 1899, when he was named runner-up for the National Gallery Travelling Scholarship. He sailed to Europe on the same ship as George Lambert. For fifteen months he painted and partied in a cold, grimy Paris studio, achieving some critical success while depending on the Lamberts for an occasional hot meal. In 1902 four of his paintings were chosen for exhibition at the New Salon, Paris; he wrote at the time 'it's rather an extraordinary thing . . . they seldom accept more than two, even from experienced and recognised men.' Ramsay's exhibited works brought him to the attention of Dame Nellie Melba, who subsequently became his patron in London. When he fell ill, she funded his return to Victoria, where Ramsay was to produce more than 20 full-length portraits before he died of consumption at the age of 28. His contemporaries admitted that he had the most brilliant potential of the artists of his generation. 'Had he lived longer', said Lambert, 'he would have beaten the lot of us."

                            "Iâ€™ve met someone who will be of more help to me than anyone else, namely, Madame Melba. Patterson brought her to my studio last Friday afternoon. She was accompanied by Mr Haddon Chambers, the playwright, and an Australian girl, Miss Johnstone. Madame Melba was great, and made me tell her all about myself, how many commissions Iâ€™d had over here and all that. She was intensely sympathetic, and I quite fell in love with her. I fancy she rather took to me, for some reason or another, as she seemed so interested, and told me she would be very angry with me if I didnâ€™t go and see her first thing when I get to London, and she promised quite voluntarily, of her own accord, to do everything she can to help me, which coming from such a person, is almost an assurance of success. With such a friend as Madame Melba, who knows everybody who is anything, well, it looks rosy for me, Auntie. My luckâ€™s in lately. My greatest fortune, next to having four pictures in the Salon, is to have been looked on favourable [sic] by Madame Melba.\\n\\nShe actually sat for half an hour for me, to do a sketch, but I was a bit flabbergasted and too nervous to do a chef dâ€™oeuvre. She has promised that she will pose for me in London. What an opportunity. Think of it. If I could make a successful portrait of her, Iâ€™m a made man.\\n\\nMadame Melbaâ€™s a charming lady, so natural, sincere and unaffected. Although sheâ€™s a great lady, you feel at home with her from the first, she doesnâ€™t put fears into your heart, as many in her position would, but makes you feel quite at your ease. I could tell you heaps of little incidents that happened during her one and a half hour stay at the studio, but wait till I see you, when perhaps Iâ€™ll have more to add.",

                            "Alison Baily Rehfisch (1900â€“1975) was born Alison Green in Woollahra, New South Wales, to parents who 'were very interested in painting â€“ in all the arts: music, literature, everything'. Her mother, a painter, woodcarver and accomplished musician, was a staunch supporter of women's rights and encouraged her daughter's interest in art. Rehfisch stated in 1965 that she began making art in earnest around the age of five in the wake of the death of her younger sister, her sole playmate. 'Life seemed so cruel without her, [so] I started to draw, pictures of God and heaven and angels and things â€¦ and the world to which I imagined she'd gone', Rehfisch said. Following the family's move to Mosman, she attended SCEGGS Redlands and after she finished school it was agreed that she should study art seriously. With her parents' full support, she studied under Julian Ashton at his Sydney art school for a time but left at the age of nineteen to marry Rodney Rehfisch, a warehouse manager. Their daughter was born in 1920. With her painting curtailed by wifehood and motherhood, it was several years before Rehfisch was able to resume her practice. When she did, she took classes with Antonio Dattilo-Rubbo at the Royal Art Society of New South Wales, where she met artist George Duncan. 'It was then that I really started to work', Rehfisch said, 'and from that day to now Iâ€™ve never ceased to work.' \\n\\nIn 1929, alongside her friend Dora Jarret, Rehfisch held her first exhibition at Farmer's Blaxland Gallery and she began exhibiting with the Society of Artists in 1931. By this time, she and her husband had separated and she was living in a studio apartment in Bridge Street in the city. Rah Fizelle, Dorrit Black, Thea Proctor and Adelaide Perry had digs in the same building. Heading to Europe in 1933, she studied at London's Grosvenor School of Modern Art under Iain MacNab, and became influenced by artists including Marc Chagall, El Greco, and Georges Braque â€“ the latter for what she called his 'feeling of design, his reality. Reality has always appealed to me. I've always hated frills and that sort of thing, in life and in painting too', she said. With Duncan, Elaine Haxton and sculptor Gerald Lewers, Rehfisch held a show at Cooling Galleries in London in 1934; and in 1938, she was one of the cash-strapped expats, including William Dobell, who contributed to the gigantic felt mural designed by Arthur Murch for the Australian Wool pavilion at the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow. During her time abroad, Rehfisch also exhibited with the Society of Women Artists, the British Empire Society, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, and at the SocietÃ© des Beaux Arts, Paris.\\n\\nFollowing the death of her estranged husband, and having travelled and painted in Spain, France and Germany, Rehfisch returned to Sydney in late 1938. She and Duncan married there in December 1942. Duncan worked as a camouflage artist during the war, and he and Rehfisch exhibited jointly at Macquarie Galleries, and in group shows with the Contemporary Group and the Contemporary Art Society. A fire in their studio in 1947 â€“ in which some 200 of Rehfischâ€™s paintings were destroyed â€“ prompted a move away from the city, and for the next several years they lived in the Southern Highlands. From 1939 until 1969, Rehfisch exhibited regularly in solo and group shows at Macquarie Galleries, the David Jones Art Gallery (of which Duncan was director from 1953 to 1964), the Blaxland Gallery and other venues in Sydney and interstate. She was known for her landscapes, still lifes and particularly her flowerpieces, often executed on hessian and always in a consistently post-impressionist style that employed rhythmic, structured composition, simple forms and a bold yet harmonious use of colour. As a result, Rehfisch was occasionally disparaged by critics who, in thrall to the vigorous, expressionist styles that came to prevail in the post-WW2 period, saw a lack of development or relevance in her work and that of some of her peers. 'These are contemporary painters in the sense that they are still living rather than in the sense that their work is executed in a contemporary idiom', James Gleeson wrote in 1951 of the Contemporary Group's annual exhibition. In 1950, Gleeson described Rehfisch's flowerpieces as being possessed of 'an ability to enthral us with a kind of magic nostalgia.' From the 1960s onwards, she and Duncan lived in Pymble, where Rehfisch painted and taught. Experiencing failing eyesight as well as bouts of severe depression following Duncan's death in 1974, Rehfisch took her own life in March 1975. Like many women artists of her generation, Rehfisch is now recognised as one of the foremost exponents of modernism in Australia, and her work has been included in landmark exhibitions such as Janine Burke's _Australian Women Artists: 100 Years 1840â€“1940_ (University of Melbourne, 1975) and _The National Women's Art Exhibition_, which consisted of more than 140 exhibitions presented simultaneously at galleries and museum around Australia in 1995. In 2002, the Beagle Press published the monograph _Alison Rehfisch: A life for art_, and the first ever retrospective of Rehfisch's work was presented at the National Trust SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney."

                            "When my daughter reached school age, a terrific longing to paint came over me, I just had to do something like that. I joined Dattilo Rubboâ€™s classes. It was then that I really did start to work. He was a wonderful teacher. He realised I was an unconventional, peculiar sort of person really, and he rather encouraged it, not always approving but always sympathetic and helpful. It was there that I met my present husband, who has always been a help to me, with his encouragement and criticism and so on, George Duncan.\\n\\nI worked seriously for years and years and from that day to now Iâ€™ve never ceased to paint.\\n\\nWithin the last few years, Iâ€™ve been extraordinarily interested in an ecological approach, which is the balance of life and place. I wanted to balance my subjects with something behind it, something deeper behind it. I think my early childhood feelings about trying to get behind things had something to do with it. Itâ€™s always been with me, always been interested in the other side of things. But somehow or other itâ€™s terribly difficult to get right behind things, as I think every artist should do. After all, itsâ€™ not just a superficial rendering of the things we see in front of us, itâ€™s trying to get the spirit behind all that and join it up with something, another life that isnâ€™t quite only of this world, and I expect I shall go along those lines for quite a while yet.\\n\\nUsually, when Iâ€™m painting anything at all, things come to me. Iâ€™m slightly psychic, and things come to me in that peculiar period just between waking and sleeping. I see the whole composition, the colour scheme, the feeling of the thing, but I have to work out the detail, of course, physically, myself, afterwards; but the whole general feeling of the thing usually comes to me, and I never start an important work unless that happens because I find itâ€™s never any use at all.",

                            "Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), acknowledged as one of the world's great portraitists, was master of portraits in the 'Grand Manner', replete with moral and heroic symbolism. Reynolds studied in London and Rome before establishing himself as an artist in London, where he was at the height of his fame by 1760. In 1764 he founded the Literary Club, with Joseph Banks, Dr Johnson, James Boswell, Adam Smith, actor David Garrick and playwrights Richard Sheridan and Oliver Goldsmith amongst the members. In 1768 he became the first President of the Royal Academy of Arts; he wrote a celebrated series of Discourses on Art to deliver to its members. Reynolds painted most of the stars of 18th century England. A few years after he painted Banks, he depicted Omai, exhibiting the work at the Royal Academy in the spring of 1776. Described by the National Portrait Gallery, London as 'an incredible socialite, social climber and self-promoter', Reynolds is buried in St Paul's Cathedral."

                            "Michael Riley (1960â€“2004), a Wiradjuri/Kamilaroi photographer, filmmaker and video-artist, was one of Australia's most influential Aboriginal contemporary artists. Born in Dubbo, Riley moved to Sydney in the late 1970s, setting aside his carpentry apprenticeship in 1982 and taking photography courses at Sydney University's Tin Sheds Gallery and the Sydney College of the Arts. Riley and his work became integral to the emerging movement of Indigenous artists working in photography and new media. He was one of the co-founders of the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative in 1987 and exhibited in the groundbreaking Indigenous art exhibitions _Koori Art '84_ at Artspace and _NADOC '86 Exhibition of Aboriginal and Islander Photographers_ at the Aboriginal Artists Gallery. He also worked at Film Australia, where he wrote and directed his first film _Boomalli: Five Artists_ (1988). His first solo exhibition, _Portraits by a Window_, was held at Hogarth Galleries in 1990. In 1991, he achieved international success with his photographs of his mother's Kamilaroi family in Moree, where he grew up. These were echoed in his 1999 series, which centred on his father's Wiradjuri family in Dubbo. His last photographic series, _Cloud_ (2000), was included in the Fourth Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art at the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane and the 2003 Festival of Sydney. His achievements were celebrated in the National Gallery of Australia's 2006 retrospective, _Michael Riley: Sights Unseen_, which toured around Australia. In 2014, the National Portrait Gallery displayed fifteen of Riley's black-and-white photographic portraits, made between 1984 and 1990, representing the vibrant urban-based Indigenous arts community in Sydney."

                            "Tom Roberts (1856â€“1931), artist, came to Australia from England at the age of 13, but returned eight years later to study art in London. He arrived back in Melbourne in 1885 and established a successful portrait practice. At the same time, he began to paint outdoors with a number of other artists, including Charles Conder and Arthur Streeton, and they came to be known as the â€˜Heidelberg Schoolâ€™. In 1889 Roberts was an organiser of, and key participant in, the _9 by 5 Impression Exhibition_ in Melbourne. That year, intent on a series of paintings depicting quintessentially Australian scenes, he travelled from Melbourne to observe the action in the shearing shed on Brocklesby on the Murray near Corowa, New South Wales. There, over a few years he painted _Shearing the rams_ and _A break away_. In 1891 he moved to an artistsâ€™ camp at Sirius Cove near Mosman, Sydney; he was to live in the city for twelve years. In 1892 he exhibited some significant portraits. Amongst them were _Eileen_ and _Aboriginal head_ (Charlie Turner), the first two of his pictures to be purchased for the Art Gallery of New South Wales; and also the trio â€˜Church State and Lawâ€™, portraits of Cardinal Moran, Henry Parkes and Justice William Windeyer. (The location of the portrait of Cardinal Moran is one of Australian art's great mysteries.) Having completed his series of â€˜Australianâ€™ pictures with _The Golden Fleece_ and _Bailed Up_ by 1895, in the late 1890s he painted his series on wood panels of eminent Australians, amongst them many musicians and newspapermen; and also the remainder of his great portraits of women. Unsuccessful in his lobbying for the establishment of a national collection of portraits in the newly-federated Australia, he moved to England in 1903. In London, he completed his vast â€˜Big Pictureâ€™ of the opening of the Australian Parliament, but the project was exhausting, his eyesight dwindled, and he fell into a black period as the success he had hoped for in the old country eluded him. During the First World War he understated his age to work as an orderly at the Third London General Hospital, Wandsworth. He returned permanently to Australia in 1923, settling at Kallista in the Dandenongs. There, he mostly painted small landscapes and flower pieces."

                            "William Robinson AO (b. 1936) is one of Australia's most distinguished and influential contemporary painters, known for his distinctive and prolific output as landscape painter in particular. Born and raised in Brisbane, he trained as a teacher and studied art at the Central Technical College (now Queensland University of Technology) in the 1950s, after which he began a distinguished career as a tertiary art educator in Brisbane and Toowoomba (including at QUT). His painting practice continued alongside his teaching work, and he held his first solo exhibitions in Brisbane in the late 1960s. During the 1970s, following his move with his wife Shirley to a small farm outside Brisbane, he began creating works which were inspired by Bonnard and documented his surroundings, the interiors of his home and the day-to-day life of his growing family. When they moved to a bigger property at Beechmont in the Gold Coast hinterland, he began painting farmyard scenes â€“ witty, merry pictures in which cows, goats, chickens and other animals cavort across the picture plane, often with minimal acknowledgement of realism or perspective. He included self portraits and portraits of Shirley in many of these works. 'Every place that we've ever lived has really affected my work', Robinson has stated. 'My work is a total reflection of my life, and these places have sometimes been difficult but they have been of extreme importance because they have given me an individuality â€¦ rather than a recipe which must be followed, or fashion or anything like that. I abhor fashion: I could never become a fashion model and nor could I become a fashionable painter, because I just do what I am.' The move to Beechmont also initiated Robinson's engagement with the landscape, which he likewise began rendering in swirling, increasingly Romantic compositions that dispense with conventional viewpoints, incorporating multiple perspectives instead. Skies, rivers, rainforests and ranges contort and are upended; night and day, summer and winter coincide; trees grow sideways or upside-down; stars collide with the forest canopy and vice-versa. During the same period, Robinson entered the Archibald Prize for the first time with _William and Josephine_ (1984) â€“ a self-portrait with one of his favourite cows. Robinson won the Prize for the first time in 1987 with _Equestrian self portrait_; his second Archibald win came in 1995 with _Self portrait with stunned mullet_ â€“ his final Archibald entry.\\n\\nArt critic John McDonald has written that Robinson 'is the only non-Aboriginal artist since Fred Williams and John Olsen to give us an entirely new view of the Australian landscape.' Twice winner of the Wynne Prize (in 1990 and 1996), Robinson's name has become synonymous with swooping, grand and all-encompassing pictures of gnarled rainforests and deep green mountain ranges, dizzying views of the heavens, and paintings evoking the creation. His work is represented in in each of the major Australian public art museums as well as in prestigious international collections such as those of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the British Museum, London. In 2011, Robinson donated works valued at almost $5 million to the Queensland University of Technology in honour of his longstanding association with the institution as a student and educator. The gift included both of his Archibald-winning self portraits and now forms the basis of the William Robinson Gallery, situated on QUT's Gardens Point campus in Old Government House. Robinson has held numerous solo exhibitions since the late 1960s and his work has been included in a similar number of prestigious group exhibitions. He has represented Australia at the Venice Biennale (in 1990), and the retrospectives of his work â€“ _William Robinson: the revelation of lands_cape (SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney, 2003) and _Darkness and Light: the art of William Robinson_ (QAG, 2001) have toured to venues across the country. Robinson's official honours include an AO, awarded in 2007, and three honorary doctorates."

                            "Robert Rooney (1937-2017), painter, conceptual artist and photographer, studied at Swinburne Technical college from 1954 to 1957. Between 1961 and 1966 he â€˜slowly and systematically eliminated the figureâ€™ from his paintings. In between his Slippery seal (1967) and Canine capers (1969) series, in which he used brightly coloured cut-outs on the back of Kelloggâ€™s boxes as stencils, he was represented in The Field. Soon after he made his Superknits series, hard-edged abstractions, â€˜absurdlyâ€™ based on knitting patterns. He studied at the Phillip Institute from 1972 to 1973; by 1978, his work was the subject of survey exhibitions at the NGV and the Art Gallery of New South Wales; with hindsight, it has become clear that although Rooneyâ€™s work â€˜employs the visual vocabulary of colour-field painting, it is in fact closer in intent to pop and conceptual artâ€™. From 1980 to 1982 he was art critic for the Age; for the next eighteen years he held the same position at the Australian. Rooney exhibited at Pinocotheca and then Tolarno Gallery between 1960 and 2006. The Monash Univeristy Museum of Art retrospective From the Homefront: Robert Rooney Works 1953-88, held in 1990, was accompanied by a catalogue essay by Philip Brophy. Since then, Rooneyâ€™s hand-painted acrylic pictures have been based on illustrations in little-known childrenâ€™s books or concerned with artworks made by children themselves, though he explains that it is not his aim to draw or paint like a child; rather, his interest is in â€˜modern Art (or Modernism) and childhood, or, if you like, the early childhood of Modernism.â€™ His recent exhibitions at Tolarno include Balletomania (2005) and Le Rire. In 2010-2011 the National Gallery of Victoria presented Endless Present: Robert Rooney and Conceptual Art, featuring Rooneyâ€™s photographs in the context of his comprehensive collection of Australian and international conceptual art, much of it gifted to the NGV."

                            "Marilyn Rowe AM OBE (b. 1946), former prima ballerina, was the first graduate of The Australian Ballet School to become its director. Born in Sydney, Rowe was one of 23 students in the first intake of The Australian Ballet School in 1964. At that time, Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn were guesting with The Australian Ballet, which had formed in 1962. Dame Peggy van Praagh invited Rowe to join the company at the end of 1964 and she was promoted to principal artist in 1969. Four years later, she and Kelvin Coe won silver medals at the Second International Ballet Competition in Moscow. Rowe danced all of the major roles in The Australian Ballet's repertoire and had several works created for her by leading international choreographers, including _Gemini_ (Glen Tetley), _The Merry Widow_ (Ronald Hynd) and _Anna Karenina_ (AndrÃ© Prokovsky). She and Coe performed in New York and London, and became the first Australians to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi, Riga and Vilnius ballet companies. At the end of 1980, while pregnant, Rowe's husband Christopher Maver died in a plane crash. She went into seclusion, but when her son was six months old, in response to demands from the dancers, she returned to the company as an adviser to the artistic director. In 1982 and 1985 she received the Green Room Award for Best Female Dancer. Director of the Dancers' Company from 1984 to 1986, she was on the board of The Australian Ballet from 1994 to 2009, and was Director of The Australian Ballet School from 1999 to 2014. Rowe has produced and directed major contemporary and classical works and received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Australian Dance Awards in 2015."

                            "Kenneth Rowell AM (1920â€“1999), artist and theatre designer, grew up in Melbourne and became intent on a career in the theatre at a young age. Around the age of thirteen, he left school and found work as a window dresser, spending his spare cash on theatre and his spare time at the National Gallery of Victoria. He began designing backdrops and costumes during the early 1940s, earning his first professional commission in 1947. Awarded a British Council Scholarship in 1950, he moved to London, subsequently working there and in Australia over the next four decades on more than 140 ballet, opera and theatre productions. In the 1960s, he developed a close association with The Australian Ballet, creating designs for productions including _Coppelia_ (1960), _Giselle_ (1965) and _Sleeping Beauty_ (1973), the latter being the first production performed by the company at the Sydney Opera House. In the 1970s, he created the sets and costumes for the ballets of Peter Sculthorpe's _Sun Music_ and _Rites of Passage_, choreographed by Robert Helpmann. At the same time, Rowell developed a considerable reputation as an artist, producing expressionist paintings, mixed media works and sculpture inspired by the Australian landscape. The National Gallery of Australia holds more than 400 examples of his costume design drawings; and in 1999, Opera Australia mounted the retrospective exhibition _Double Act_."

                            "Early on, at the beginning of my career, I really wasnâ€™t interested in painting at all. Quite simply I was stagestruck and for a long time thatâ€™s really all I wanted to do, I just wanted to work in the theatre, I was mad about the theatre. That seemed enough for a few years, or perhaps for ten years, and then I became terribly conscious of the fact that I was working in a medium that you can never be wholly in charge of as a designer or a producer or a choreographer; youâ€™re one of a number of collaborators working together on a production. And I became more and more interested in the idea of painting because that seemed to me to be something where I could be in charge of a medium and express myself in a way that, much as I love working in the theatre, I would never have that final control about what the statement was. So I started to try and paint and I worked terribly hard. I took myself out of the theatre because I could see that the only way of developing a technique and trying to find a direction as a painter was really to get right out of the theatre for a few years. I did that, and people in the English theatre thought I was mad, but I felt it was something I absolutely had to do.\\n\\nThe paintings I did for the first few years were really not good at all. But I worked very hard, I developed a technique. I simply work in the theatre when Iâ€™m offered work that I want to do and when Iâ€™m not doing that, Iâ€™m up in the studio painting for all Iâ€™m worth.\\n\\nI know that this work I do as a painter nourishes all my theatre work, the colours even that Iâ€™ve used in the _Sleeping Beauty_ which are very â€“ particularly in the prologue and scenes like that â€“ absolutely strong, chromatic colours I know I donâ€™t see in other theatre. I can only use these because of all Iâ€™ve learned as a painter. Anyway, the thing is that both forms of activity now are absolutely necessary to me. People donâ€™t particularly want you to work in two different media but itâ€™s something that I absolutely need.",

                            "Rachel Roxburgh (1915â€“1991), artist, conservationist and architectural historian, grew up in Sydney's eastern suburbs and studied art at East Sydney Technical College and the Adelaide Perry Art School in the 1930s. She exhibited with the Society of Artists, the Contemporary Group and at the Macquarie Galleries; at the same time, she was a competitive horserider and keen surfer. In 1940, she first exercised what proved to be a formidable skill at fundraising by organising an exhibition in aid of the Journalists and Artists Ambulance Fund. The exhibition featured loaned works by British artists such as Augustus John and Duncan Grant, and locals such as William Dobell, and enabled the purchase of an ambulance for the army's Medical Services division. Roxburgh qualified as a nurse during the war; when it was over she went to London and studied at the Central School of Art. She worked in a number of jobs during her ten years abroad including dressmaking, nursing, creating costumes for the Old Vic Theatre and teaching art as therapy in hospitals. She also took up pottery, which she studied at the Hammersmith School of Arts and Crafts. After returning to Sydney she joined the Potters Society of New South Wales, exhibiting in its first group show at the Macquarie Galleries in 1958. The interior designer Marion Hall Best sold her pots, as did the David Jones Art Gallery. For many years she taught art and pottery at schools including Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School, Abbotsleigh and Ravenswood, and at East Sydney Technical College. From the 1960s onwards she was increasingly involved in built heritage conservation, serving on the council and the executive of the National Trust (NSW) and on its historical and architectural survey committee. Among her many contributions, she was integral to the fundraising for the restoration of Francis Greenway's St Matthewâ€™s Church in Windsor; and she published a number of books on colonial architectural treasures. A committed bushwalker, she held roles with the National Parks Association and the National Parks Advisory Council and campaigned for the preservation of wilderness now contained in the South-East Forests National Park."

                            "Helena Rubinstein (c. 1870â€“1965), cosmetician, businesswoman and philanthropist, is the founder of one of the first international cosmetic companies. Rubinstein left her home in KrakÃ³w, Poland at age 22 and moved to Australia. When local women in Coleraine, Victoria admired her skin, she is said to have set about importing pots of face cream made by a chemist in Poland, later described as 'the celebrated Russian skin specialist Dr Lykuski'. She opened her first beauty salon in Melbourne in 1902, with her signature CrÃ¨me Valaze, said to include rare herbs from the Carpathian Mountains, but probably comprising mostly lanolin sourced from local druggists Felton, Grimwade & Co. Her beauty cream was an overnight sensation. In late 1905 she established the Valaze Institute in Collins Street, offering various beauty treatments administered by her sisters and developing skincare and make-up. Having expanded to Sydney and Wellington, New Zealand, in 1908 Rubinstein departed with Â£100,000, to open modern salons in London and Paris. Fleeing wartime France, she opened in New York in 1916, becoming one of the first luxury beauty brands in the US; other stand-alone salons followed, and she established a presence in various department stores while retaining brand and marketing control. After the war, she returned to Paris, where she collected modern art, African and Oceanic sculpture and jewellery. In 1953 she established the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, which funded Tel Avivâ€™s Helena Rubinstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art, and also the Helena Rubinstein travelling art scholarship in Australia, which she last visited in 1957. The year before she died she published her memoir, _My Life for Beauty_. In 1973, the Helena Rubinstein brand was sold to Colgate-Palmolive, and is now owned by Lâ€™OrÃ©al."

                            "Jenny Sages (b. 1933), artist, was born to Russian Jewish parents in Shanghai and came to Australia with her family in 1948. After cursory art studies at East Sydney Technical College she attended Franklin School of Art, New York. Having returned to Sydney and married Jack Sages, between 1955 and 1984 she worked as a freelance illustrator and travel writer for books and fashion magazines including _Vogue Australia_. Following a trip to the Kimberley in 1983, Sages decided to become a full-time artist, concentrating on portraits, abstract and landscape works. A specialist in the medium of encaustic wax, delicately coloured with powdered pigments, since 1985 she has worked in a studio atop her home in Carlotta Road, Double Bay; she has had regular solo exhibitions since 1988. Her portrait of Emily Kngwarreye, the first work purchased for the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in 1998, was painted following her annual trips to Central Australia. From 2010 to 2013 an expanded iteration of the National Portrait Gallery exhibition _Jenny Sages: Paths to Portraiture_ toured to Tweed, Toowoomba, Mackay, Burnie and Mosman. Sages won the Portia Geach Award in 1992 and 1994 and the Wynne Prize in 2005, and has been a finalist for the Archibald Prize twenty times (1990, 1993â€“2009, 2011â€“2012); her 2000 and 2001 Archibald Prize entries were highly commended by the Trustees and the affecting self-portrait of the artist in widowhood, _After Jack_, was People's Choice in 2012. She last entered the Prize in 2013 with a portrait of Sarah Engledow, which was hung in the Salon des RefusÃ©s. The National Portrait Gallery has her portraits of Emily Kngwarreye, Helen Garner, Kate Grenville, Irina Baronova, and Nancy Borlase and Laurie Short. Her solo exhibition, _Lest I forget_, showed at her long-term gallery, King Street Gallery on William, in 2018."

                            "Leo Schofield AM (b. 1935) has been a significant figure in Australia's cultural life for three decades. With a background in advertising and journalism, he was the director of the Melbourne Festival from 1994 to 1996 and the Sydney Festival from 1997 to 2001. In the latter role, he was credited with making the annual showcase for music, dance, theatre, art exhibitions and outdoor events more diverse, accessible and financially viable. From 1996 to 2000 he was the energetic inaugural chairman of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and in 2001 he directed the Olympic Arts Festival. He has been a lively and powerful newspaper and television commentator on the performing arts, food, museums and heritage issues, and during his long tenancy at Sydney's historic Bronte House he painstakingly restored and maintained the house and its grounds. In 2001 Schofield gained an honorary doctorate for his cultural advocacy from the University of New South Wales."

                            "Ronald 'Bon' Scott (1946-1980) had come to Australia with his family in 1952, aged six, had lived in Melbourne and Fremantle, where he joined a pipe band; had dropped out of school at fifteen; and had spent some time in custody. By 1974, Scott was working at a fertiliser plant by day and writing songs that he would try out with other musicians at night. Artistic differences had arisen between AC/DC and their lead singer, Dave Evans, and Scott had had a terminal falling-out with his own loose group, the Mount Lofty rangers. He liked AC/DC but thought they were too young to rock; they thought he was too old to rock; but their first jam session was enough to seal the first AC/DC lineup. The following year, with two albums and four huge singles in Australia, the band was signed to an international deal, but American success did not come until Highway to Hell reached number 17 on the US charts in 1979. Two years later he was dead, having inhaled his own vomit while 'sleeping off' a bender in a parked car in London. His grave in Fremantle is the most-visited grave in Australia. In mid- 2004 UK magazine Classic Rock rated Scott as number one in a list of the 100 Greatest Frontmen. Significantly, however, largely thanks to Angus Young's star status, the band weathered the loss of Scott and his replacement by Brian Johnston. AC/DC's Back in Black, issued five months after Scott's death, is said to be the second-highest-selling album of all time worldwide, after Michael Jackson's Thriller; it is the fifth-highest selling album in the USA alone."

                            "George Seddon AM (1927-2007), scholar and academic, studied English at Melbourne University before spending several years abroad, travelling and teaching at universities in Europe and North America. He returned to Australia in 1956 to take up a lectureship in English at the University of Western Australia and during this time developed an interest in environmentalism. He completed a BSc in Perth, with a major in geology, and then returned to the USA, attaining masters and doctoral degrees in science from the University of Minnesota. He briefly returned to WA before going back to America and taking up a professorship in geology and geophysics at the University of Oregon. In 1970, he published his first book, Swan River Landscapes. This was followed by many others including A Sense of Place (1972); Your vegetable garden in Australia (1983); A city and its setting (1986); and Searching for the Snowy: an environmental history (1994), which won the Eureka Prize. From 1971 to 1974, Seddon was chair of the History and Philosophy of Science program at the University of NSW. He then became the founding professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Melbourne; and was dean of the Faculty of Architecture and Planning there from 1982 until 1987. Seddon's other interests included tennis, gardening, botany, photography and languages. He was the recipient of many awards and in 1998 he was made a Member of the Order of Australia. In retirement he lived in Fremantle, where he died in May 2007."

                            "Robin Sellick (b. 1967), photographer, is well known for his distinctive portraits of Australian actors, musicians, politicians and athletes. Sellick grew up in Broken Hill in regional New South Wales. After receiving a Young Achiever Award and Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Grant in 1991, he travelled to New York, where he worked as an assistant to photographers including Annie Leibovitz, Mark Seliger and Mary Ellen Mark. In 1994 he returned to Sydney, and began shooting for major publications including _Vogue_ and _Australian Style_. Retaining a distinct influence of his early years, during which he was surrounded by bush characters with large personalities, over the course of his career he has tried to craft a style of photography that is intrinsically Australian. He was instrumental in developing a distinctive photography style for the newly published _Who Weekly_, and was the first photographer to be commissioned to shoot in Australia for _Marie Claire_. His creative use of light came to be seen as a trademark feature of his work. His portraits have appeared on the covers of _NME_, _Q Magazine_ and German _Rolling Stone_ and continue to be published around the world. The National Portrait Gallery holds seventeen of his portraits, including photographs of Sir Donald Bradman, Shane Warne and Molly Meldrum."

                            "Anneliese Seubert (b. 1973), fashion model, grew up in Cooma, New South Wales, her family having migrated from Germany when she was nine. She began modelling while a boarder at Canberra Girls' Grammar School and was 'discovered' after becoming a finalist in the _Dolly_ Covergirl competition in 1989. In 1990, aged seventeen, she won the Ford Models Supermodel of the World competition, but signed with the Paris-based agency Karin instead of the New York-based Ford. Over the next two decades Seubert lived in Paris and then New York, walking the runway for almost all the major international design houses, including Dior, Hermes, Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Versace. She appeared in editorials for magazines such as _Vogue_, _Marie Claire_, _Harper's Bazaar_ and _Elle_; posed for leading fashion photographers such as Mario Testino and Lillian Bassman; and represented Covergirl, Guerlain Perfumes, Hermes and Pantene. Now living in Canberra with her partner and two daughters, Seubert takes on occasional modelling jobs, including a Country Road campaign and fashion shoots for the _Australian Women's Weekly_."

                            "Wendy Sharpe undertook art studies in Sydney between 1978 and 1984 and held her first solo exhibition at the Nicholson Street Gallery in 1985. Ten years later, having exhibited at various venues, she had her first solo exhibition with King Street Gallery, where she has shown ever since. To date, she has held 57 solo shows. She won the Sulman Prize in 1986, and the same year was awarded a residency at the CitÃ©, Paris; in 1989 she won the Mercedes Benz Scholarship to travel to the Middle East and Italy. Between 1990 and 1999 she won the Waverley Art Prize, the Robert Le Gay Brereton Drawing Prize, the Portia Geach Prize, the Kedumba Drawing Prize, the Bathurst Art Prize and the Archibald Prize; she won the Portia Geach Prize again in 2003 and gained another residency at the CitÃ© in 2006. Meanwhile, in 1998-1999 the City of Sydney commissioned her to paint eight enormous murals for at the Olympic Pool at the Cook and Phillip Aquatic Centre and the Australian War Memorial appointed her as an Official Artist attached to the Australian Army History Unit in Dili, East Timor. Her more recent residencies and associations have included one at Taronga Zoo in 2011, one in Antarctica in 2012, one with Circus Oz in 2015-2016 and one at the State Library of New South Wales in 2018. Renowned for her richly-coloured, carnivalesque and variously-perspectived works, she is particularly interested in the curvaceous, voluptuous forms of dancers, acrobats, drag artists and burlesque performers and the effects of stage, street and domestic lighting. The book _Wendy Sharpe_ was published in 2011 to coincide with the artist's retrospective exhibition, _Wendy Sharpe: The imagined life_ at the SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney.With more than 1500 dedicated Facebook followers, Sharpe divides her years between Sydney and Paris, where she has homes and studios."

                            "Jiawei Shen (b. 1948), artist, was born in China in 1948 and began to gain recognition as a painter during the Cultural Revolution. Largely self-taught at first, he eventually studied at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, where he became strongly influenced by his teacher Shangyi, Chinaâ€™s most famous portraitist. Shen became a specialist in history paintings, many of which he produced for public collections. One picture, however â€“ a depiction of heroes of the Chinese nationalist movement â€“ necessitated his departure from China in 1989. His wife, artist Lan Wang, was pregnant when he left; it was two years before they were reunited in Sydney, where Shen met their daughter Xini for the first time. Having started out making sketches of passers-by at Darling Harbour, Shen is now a much sought-after portraitist, a regular Archibald finalist and has created work for clients such as the Vatican and Parliament House. He has painted commissions of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Tom Hughes KC and L Gordon Darling AC CMG for the National Portrait Gallery. 'There are two sides to my work,' he explains. 'When I came here I was nothing â€¦ so any commission was very exciting. But for a long time now, I've been interested in making paintings that show the big things: the world, history, great men.' To make a picture such as _The Third World_ 2002, depicting 92 identifiable contemporary and historical figures, he spends months in the library, as well as in his studio. He has no plans to return to China, commenting that â€˜When I go back I see the worst of communism and the worst of capitalism.' Shen and Wang both live and work in Bundeena, south of Sydney."

                            "Arnold Shore, a lifelong inhabitant of Melbourne, was apprenticed to a stained glass and leadlight company called Brooks, Robinson soon after leaving school at the age of twelve. He worked there for more than twenty years, and there, he met his lifelong friend, artist Jock Frater. For five years before World War 1 he trained at the NGV School under Frederick McCubbin, but left before completing his qualifications, transferring to the tuition of Max Meldrum until 1923. Meanwhile, he read up on modern European art when he got the chance. Over the 1930s he developed a reputation for flower studies before turning to the bush, which became a favourite subject. He exhibited with the Twenty Melbourne Paintersâ€™ Society, a breakaway group from the dominant Victorian Artistsâ€™ Society, from 1923 to 1946. In 1932, with the older and wealthier George Bell, an established art critic, he founded the Bell-Shore School. Bell had been classically trained; as Shore put it, â€˜Bellâ€™s training and experience was balanced by my enthusiasm and sense of art . . . He generally trusted to logic. I depended on feeling.â€™ The school quickly became an important influence on the development of Melbourne modernism but tensions developed between the founders and the partnership dissolved in 1936. In 1935 HV â€˜Docâ€™ Evatt and his wife Mary Alice gave Shore his first portrait commission (amongst the first works acquired for the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in 1998). The National Gallery of Victoria first purchased one of Shoreâ€™s works in 1937, and for some years he gave annual lectures there about modern art. From that time, his works were purchased by state galleries in Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney, and he also found himself increasingly teaching, lecturing, critical reviewing and judging art prizes. He won the Crouch prize in 1938. Shoreâ€™s career was at its high through much of the 1940s, when he lived at Mount Macedon and painted rich and distinctive views of the bush. By the spring of 1949 he had had six solo shows in Melbourne, the National Gallery of Victoria had five of his works and the Art Gallery of Western Australia had bought one of his paintings. In the 1950s, however, he painted very little. Throughout his life the artist endured periods of suicidal depression and anxiety, which were addressed with shock treatment and the prototype medications of the day. Shore was art critic for the _Argus_ and the _Age_. In 1957, Tam and Anne Purves held the first major retrospective of his works â€“ nearly a hundred of them - at their new Australian Galleries; both Alan McCullough and John Brack declared his significance. In 1960 and 1961 he was president of the Victorian Artistsâ€™ Society, which awarded him its medal of honour. In 1962 he was one of six Australian painters represented in a touring exhibition through Victoria, curated by James Mollison for the National Gallery of Victoria. However, by that time, the Angry Penguins were the fashionable artists of the day. Estranged from his wife and having to sell assets to afford a home, he plunged into melancholy that waxed and waned until he died of natural causes in the autumn of 1963. Shore is represented in all major Australian galleries. Much of this information is taken from _Arnold Shore: Pioneer Modernist_ by Rob Haysom."

                            "If I was walking along the street, I might be doing what a lot of other people are doing. I might be going to a shop to buy something to eat or to get a drink, or I might be going to meet somebody. But as a painter youâ€™re always looking at things, a big percentage of your time anyway, if not always, youâ€™re looking at things with a painterâ€™s eye. Youâ€™re noticing the colours and the shapes and the textures that you see about you. You also â€“ youâ€™re not lacking in humanity â€“ you also notice people, that people look sad or sick or happy and so on, when you see them. You see a drunk and you step out of his way if you think heâ€™s going to be pugnacious, and so on, or you laugh at him if heâ€™s just happy. But as a painter you look for these colours and these shapes, and youâ€™re thinking of your job. It might sound awful to talk about painting as a job, but it is a job just like anything else.\\n\\nAnd another thing, Iâ€™m breaking in on myself, but I believe that a cricketer or a footballer or a golf player, that they are when theyâ€™re at the best, that theyâ€™re in the same position as the artist; theyâ€™re using their knowledge and their skill and their feeling to do something. There is a difference: the golfer when he dies, heâ€™s dead except in the memory of people who remember that he won a certain competition or that he put up some record round, but he doesnâ€™t leave anything behind him except that. The artist if heâ€™s lucky, and the worldâ€™s lucky, does leave things behind him and thereâ€™s a peculiar quality about a work of art, is that once itâ€™s created by a man who combines knowledge and feeling â€“ it doesnâ€™t matter whether heâ€™s a primitive, a caveman, an Aboriginal artist in the bush, or a painter in a studio in one of the great cities of the world, a Rembrandt or a Velasquez â€“ once they create a work of art that really is a work of art, it never loses its quality. Art doesnâ€™t progress; it changes.\\n\\nÂ ",

                            "Ivy Shore (1915â€“1999), painter, was born in Melbourne, daughter of a South Australian suffragette, Elka, and engineer John Williams. After her father died in 1919, the family relocated to Adelaide. She trained as a seamstress before marrying a financier, Ray Shore, and moving to Sydney. Bored, she enrolled in painting classes with Graeme Inson, a disciple of Max Meldrum's. Separating from her husband in 1960, she bought a house in Ocean Street, Woollahra and in 1962, soon after Shore was widowed, Inson moved in. Through the 1960s Shore continued to develop her artistic skills under Inson, and he in turn eventually dubbed her 'my greatest student'. She first entered the Portia Geach competition in 1976; she won it in 1979 with a portrait of Della Elliott, now in the National Portrait Gallery collection. Inson was so irritated by the style of the portrait â€“ a departure from the Meldrum method â€“ that he went to live in his studio, but he returned home after a week. Shore used her prize money to have a studio built by architect Peter Moffitt above the garage of her house, and painted there out of sight of Inson. Over the coming years Shore continued to exhibit in the Portia Geach award, winning Most Highly Commended three times, and the Royal Easter Show Art Prize Exhibition. In 1993, she created her last painting _Influences_, a tribute to the five people who had most influenced her, depicting Henry Hanke, Robert Haines, Justin Oâ€™Brien and Lloyd Rees at a dinner table, Inson holding forth with a glass of wine in hand. This painting now hangs in The Dundee Arms Hotel in Sydney, where Inson once had a studio, alongside Inson's favourite of his own portraits of Shore. Her work is included in many galleries and private collections in Australia, UK and France."

                            "Andrew Sibley (1933â€“2015), painter and teacher, is known for his figurative paintings, landscapes and abstract works. He arrived in Australia from England in 1948 at fifteen, having studied at the Gravesend School of Art in Kent. Associated with artist Jon Molvig, he became a key member of the Brisbane School and held his first exhibition in 1960. In 1961, he exhibited at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. The following year his work was included in an exhibition at the Tate Gallery and he won the Transfield Art Prize, then Australia's richest art award. In the 1960s and 1970s his work was included in exhibitions in Japan, USA, Paris and Germany. Sibley moved to Melbourne in 1966 and was a lecturer in Fine Arts at RMIT until 1990, when he became Head of Painting at Monash University. Throughout his career he exhibited regularly and is represented in most major Australian galleries. His portraits of Molvig, Mirka Mora and Alan McCulloch were finalists in the Archibald Prize, and he was a finalist in the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize with his works of his wife Irene Sibley and Rodney Hall. Drawing was an essential part of Sibley's practice, and the National Portrait Gallery has eighteen of the artist's portraits in pencil and ink."

                            "Joshua Smith studied sculpture with Rayner Hoff and took classes in drawing and painting at Julian Ashton's Sydney Art School. During the war, Smith worked in a camouflage unit with fellow artist William Dobell. In January 1944 Dobell's portrait of Smith was awarded the Archibald Prize for 1943. A law case ensued, with the artist complainants alleging that Dobell's work was a caricature of his friend. The court found that it was a good likeness. The trial was inevitably distracting, embarrassing and debilitating for Dobell and Smith, but the following year Smith rallied to win the Archibald himself, for a portrait of HS Rosevear. Dobell's portrait of Smith was badly damaged in a fire in 1958, but it has since been restored. Smith painted several memorable portraits, including one of Dame Mary Gilmore and a haunting study of his parents acquired by the Art Gallery of NSW in 1943. He was a regular exhibitor in the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes for many years."

                            "The procedure for the portrait: Mr Rosevear came to the home and I painted it in our breakfast room where mother would prepare tea in between sittings. If I remember correctly, I asked for about 15 sittings. Being the first official portrait that Iâ€™d been given from the Government I was rather a bit scared, you know. Anyway, Mr Rosevear was very co-operative, and it eventually won the Archibald, so, quite good!\\n\\nNow with my own procedure as regards portrait painting, that has varied considerably over the years. At one stage, I used to make a small drawing, say about 15 inches deep, in pencil, and more in the nature of a very accurate map, and then work from that; but later I found that I prefer to draw straight onto the canvas with charcoal, just dust that off and then paint direct. And I also like to have my sitter in front of me the whole time.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™ve been asked to say something about Chips Raffertyâ€™s portrait and how I did it. Well that was painted out in the open in the lawn in his backyard. I had a good many sittings. I remember Chips saying to me, â€˜Youâ€™ve worn a track across my lawn, running backwards and forwards!â€™. I like to have my canvas right alongside my subject and get back from it to make my observations as far as possible.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™ve been asked about any particular highlights in my life. Well, I think one of the most important things that I can remember is my first sale of a drawing. And it was a little drawing of my mother, a pencil drawing of my mother playing the piano. And we had it in the Julian Ashton School sketch club. And I was sitting next to the late Julian Ashton and Julian turned to me and said, â€˜Would you take half a guinea for it?â€™. I said â€˜Sold!â€™.",

                            "Eric Smith (1919-2017), painter, was born in Brunswick, Melbourne, and trained in commercial art at the Brunswick Technical College before serving in the army during World War 2. After the war, he recommenced study at RMIT under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Training Scheme. Smith and his wife Joy moved to Sydney in 1952, and he found work as a window cleaner at David Jonesâ€™s. When he won his first Blake Prize for religious art in 1956, the _Sun_ reported that â€˜window cleaner Eric Smith took only an hour to paint the Scourged Christ.â€™ Characterised as a â€˜battlerâ€™, he initially painted in the bedroom he and Joy shared. In 1958 he, Joy and their children moved to Small St, Woollahra. Smith was to win the Blake prize five more times up to 1970. Notable for experimenting with diverse art styles, he also won the Wynne Prize twice, and the Sulman Prize in 1953, 1973 and 2003. In 1963, when he was in London to see his work hung in the Tate exhibition of Australian art, he received the Helena Rubinstein Art Award. \\n\\nEric Smith first entered the Archibald Prize with a strong self-portrait in 1944. He won the Prize in 1970, 1981 and 1982 with portraits of architect Neville Gruzman, art dealer Rudi Komon and composer Peter Sculthorpe respectively. The prize for the portrait of Komon survived a challenge from an artist whoâ€™d been stripped of the Archibald five years earlier for painting from a photograph. Smith acknowledged that he used photographs, but he also knew Komon, and had had multiple sittings with him. Smithâ€™s paintings are in the collections of the National Gallery, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Queensland Art Gallery. Working almost until his death, he was the subject of a television documentary, _Not Finished Yet_, in 2012."

                            "I have rarely made sketches for my paintings. Some painters do a great many drawings before they tackle the major work, but I usually go straight to the canvas or the Masonite panel. I have no real reason; I cannot explain why it seems necessary for me to get straight to the board, but Iâ€™ve always found it so. Iâ€™ve many times said to myself that I was going to do a lot of drawings, but I no sooner start than I move across to the prepared board.\\n\\nSometimes I have a particular subject in mind, religious or otherwise, but most often than not I just start painting. This seems necessary for me, to just let the thing grow, to really try and find out about myself, let the thing happen, and as the forms appear on the canvas they suggest something to me, something perhaps to do with a subject matter, and if the forms seem dynamic enough, things are working and exciting level and I push that thing on to a particular subject matter.\\n\\nIt is so hard today, we have nothing to hang our hat onto, and itâ€™s a case of really digging down deep to find out about yourself. You take a risk here that you wonâ€™t be understood.\\n\\nI have always been concerned with the human condition, whether the tragedy or aspirations of man. And everywhere new relationships are springing up which must be felt and explored, and in this way, I must create my own language to express the depth of my feelings about these things.",

Gaining diplomas in photography and advertising, she began her career as an industrial photographer before moving into photojournalism, working for daily papers and magazines. After moving to England in 1963, she worked as a freelance photographer. In 1971 she emigrated to Australia, working initially in Sydney as a photojournalist and later as a technical supervisor in a professional colour laboratory in Melbourne. Seven years later she moved to Canberra, where she established a studio that operated until 1997, endearing herself to the local population through her books I Love Canberra (1983) and I Love Canberra II (1986). In early 1998 she moved to Narooma, NSW, where she continues to take portrait photographs, travel Australia on corporate assignments, and publish books. In 2004 she returned to the Tiwi Islands north of Darwin to gather material for a follow-up book to her Tiwi: The Life and Art of Australia's Tiwi People (1990, 1996)."

In 1951 he was elected RE, and from that time he held many solo shows and participated in numerous group exhibitions. From 1965 to 1979 he was senior lecturer in fine art at the Chelsea School of Art. During the 1970s he served twice as official artist to the British Antarctic Survey. In the 1980s he painted the lighthouses of England and Wales, and illustrated the books View from the Sea (1985) and The Discovery of Antarctica (1990) by GE Fogg. In the foreword to his book The Explorations of Antarctica, the Last Unspoiled Continent (1990) Lord Shackleton described Smith as the finest recorder of the icy region in the twentieth century."

Arriving in London from Sweden in 1760, Solander became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1764 and began cataloguing plants at the British Museum. Not long after, he became known to Joseph Banks, and in 1768 he and Banks together applied to the King to obtain berths on James Cook's Endeavour. Having barely survived the dysentery that killed many of the Endeavour's crew, Solander returned to England to be fÃªted along with Banks for his scientific achievements. When Banks withdrew from Cook's second voyage, Solander followed suit; the pair went to Iceland and the Western Isles before Solander settled into the role of Banks's librarian and curator in London."

                            "When this ship was equipped to make discoveries in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean and to observe the transit of Venus, a young rich gentleman named Joseph Banks decided to go too for the sake of natural history. I have been well acquainted with him for many years and he proposed to me to go with him at his expense. I thought that such an offer and such an opportunity should not be turned down. We therefore made an application together to the King of England to obtain a passage on the ship, which was so well received by the government that the captain was ordered to give us the best cabins and to receive as well three draughtsmen and six hands who all belong to Herr Banks. The ship was called _Endeavour_, the captainâ€™s name is James Cook.\\n\\nOur intention is to sail around the southern point of the Magellanic land that is called Cape Horn and from there make our course through the South Seas to a big island that was discovered three years ago. It is inhabited by a very kind-hearted, civilized and well-shaped people. There we plan to perform our astronomic observations and maybe stay four to six months. If afterwards our ship and crew are in a good state, I believe we will try to see if there are no unknown countries left for us to discover. Our shipâ€™s name alludes to that Endeavour meaning Attempt. We will probably not return home before 1771. And if Mr Banks then is in the same spirit as now to follow up his studies of natural history we will probably directly undertake together a journey to Sweden.\\n\\nI hope when we return to Europe our ship will surely be the richest in Natural Curiosities, for Mr Banks spares himself no expense.",

                            "Lady Ellen Stirling (1807-1874) was the third daughter of James Mangles of Woodbridge in Surrey, a Director of the East India Company and later an MP. On her sixteenth birthday, Ellen married James Stirling, a naval officer twice her age. After the customary honeymoon tour of the Continent, the Stirlings settled at Woodbridge for around two years. Ellen bore the first of eleven children during this time, before James Stirling was recalled to active duty and given command of HMS Success. Stirling sailed for Sydney in early 1826, his arrival in the colony coinciding with renewed British suspicions about the intentions of the French regarding the west coast of Australia. Stirling eventually managed to convince the Colonial office of the political and commercial advantages of establishing a settlement on the Swan River and in 1828 he was appointed to the post of the new colony's Lieutenant Governor. With her husband and 3-year-old son, Ellen left England in February 1829, giving birth to her second son at sea en route to present-day Perth. The 'very affable and unaffected' Ellen Stirling was one of only a handful of 'ladies' in the new settlement, and like other governor's wives would have fulfilled the role of a hostess and focal point for colonial Society. Ellen has also been described as a courageous woman with a warm personality who took an active, if typically genteel, interest in the landscape and botany of the colony. Her 'dignified bearing', charm and youth are said to have endeared her to many in the settlement and softened some of the criticism of her husband and his governorship. Almost every year between 1831 and 1838, Ellen gave birth to more children - three daughters and three sons, one of whom died in infancy. James Stirling retired as Governor of Western Australia in 1838 and returned home with his family. The couple had three more daughters after returning to England; Ellen survived her husband by nine years."

The second box I also hope to ship but Mr Drummond who offered to fill it has been so dilatory that it has not yet made its appearance.\\n\\nIf my letter has reached you, you will know that Number One has been filled by Captain Meares. They all appear healthy plants. I sincerely hope the contents of both the boxes may arrive safely in England and that they may meet with your approbation. I should wish you to mention which of the two cases arrive in the best order and also which of the two contains the most valuable collection. Captain Meares will be much gratified to hear that his exertions have been successful, as he has been very kind in obtaining flowering shrubs. You will also receive by the _Hero_ the specimens collected and arranged by Miss Vittoria Meares and I think they are so well done that they will be valuable to you or at least to some of your friends.\\n\\nAny curious fruit trees would be an acceptable offering to Captain Meares in return for what he has done. But as he is not overburdened with riches and the large cases are rather expensive, you had better send his portion with mine or in case of our having left the colony, make some arrangement about the payment. He is very clever with everything connected with gardening. When you write to him do not allude to what I have said about expenses.\\n\\nThe box which Drummond undertook to fill has not yet arrived. It is not my fault if it is left behind for I have done all in my power to hurry the old man but he is rather obstinate and likes to have his own way. All the fruit trees that came out in the last box are dead but those that arrived in the _Shepherd_ are very flourishing. I am going to ride to Woodmanâ€™s Point in quest of shells. I walked there and back the other day, a distance of twelve miles without picking up one, but I hope I shall be more successful this morning.",

                            "David Strachan (1919â€“1970), painter and printmaker, was educated at Geelong Grammar School and then studied art at the Slade School in London. After a period of travel in France and further study at the AcadÃ©mie de la Grand ChaumiÃ¨re, he returned to Australia, enrolling at George Bellâ€™s school in Melbourne before moving to Sydney in 1941. He exhibited landscapes, figurative works and still lifes and became one of the group of artists who travelled regularly to the abandoned New South Wales mining town of Hill End. After World War II, during which he worked as a camouflage painter at Bankstown aerodrome and performed minor roles with HÃ©lÃ¨ne Kirsovaâ€™s ballet company, Strachan returned to Europe, living in Paris and then London and studying at the CJ Jung-Institut in Zurich in the late 1950s. Back in Sydney from 1960, he bought a Paddington terrace house, spurring his close friend, Margaret Olley, to purchase a house nearby; she often painted at his home, and used it as a studio after he died. During the 1960s Strachan taught at East Sydney Technical College and exhibited regularly, winning the Wynne Prize in 1961 and 1964. In the mid-1960s, too, he was the executor of the estate of Godfrey Miller and became president of the Society of Artists. In 1966 the National Gallery of Victoria held a survey exhibition, _Four Sydney Painters_, showing works by Strachan, Donald Friend, Justin Oâ€™Brien and Jeffrey Smart. In late 1970, just as he was beginning to feel â€˜contemporaryâ€™ and that his best work was still to come, Strachan died as the result of a car accident in Yass. Daniel Thomas curated the exhibition _David Strachan 1919-1970_ at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1973. Lou Klepacâ€™s _David Strachan_ with an introduction by Barry Pearce and an essay by John McDonald accompanied a touring exhibition of Strachanâ€™s work in 1993. The National Portrait Gallery acquired Strachanâ€™s portrait of Kenneth Rowell through the intervention of Margaret Olley in 2002. The Tweed Regional Art Gallery and Margaret Olley Studio mounted the exhibition _The mystery of things: Margaret Olley and David Strachan_ in 2016."

Becoming interested in women's issues in her twenties, in the interwar years she intervened in unemployment relief, the plight of Jewish refugees, and Indigenous rights. She stood unsuccessfully as a Labor Party candidate in the federal elections of 1939 and 1946; in between, in 1945, she was the sole Australian woman delegate to the founding of the United Nations, where she pressed for women's rights. Street first visited Russia in 1938, and was president of the Australian Russian Society from 1946; as the Cold War developed, she was (falsely) accused of communist sympathies. In 1949, expelled from the Labor party, she stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate. Street's husband, Sir Kenneth Street, was Chief Justice of NSW from 1950, and for much of the 1950s she worked for the World Peace Council in London. Her son, Laurence, became Chief Justice of New South Wales in 1974."

After all, the trade union movement is supposed to represent both the men and the women in jobs. There must be amongst their membership, the same number of intelligent women as there are intelligent men. And I would very much hope to see in the future â€“ I donâ€™t suppose itâ€™ll come in my lifetime â€“ that they have the proper distribution of places of influence between men and women both in the governing bodies of unions, and also, later on, when things gets more socialistic, in the governing body of the industries themselves.\\n\\nNow I say, â€˜get more socialisticâ€™, there because many years ago I became a socialist. I read quite a lot of books about politics and so on and so forth, and it seemed to me to be the system under which the individual, whether a man or a woman, had the greatest opportunity of developing their usefulness and status. You only have to look back in history in the days of serfdom and all the rest of it. Itâ€™s as theyâ€™ve gradually overcome the limitations that were placed on them by the social system, that not only women have advanced but society itself has advanced. And of course, if you come to think of it, men and women are both components of society and if you have a horse with a lame foot or a shackled foot itâ€™s not going to gallop was well as one that hasnâ€™t got, who hasnâ€™t got any shackles on. And itâ€™s the same with the human race â€“ if youâ€™re going to shackle the women, as they have been in the past and to a certain extent still are, youâ€™re going to hold up the progress of the whole of our society.",

                            "Anne Summers AO (b. 1945), writer and feminist, became involved in women's rights while studying politics at the University of Adelaide in the 1960s. In 1969 she was one of five women involved in founding the Women's Liberation Movement group in Adelaide. She then moved to Sydney and in 1973 was part of a cooperative that established Australiaâ€™s first refuge for victims of domestic violence, Elsie. For her doctorate at the University of Sydney, Summers wrote her first book, _Damned Whores and God's Police_ (1975), a landmark text in Australian feminism that has sold over 100,000 copies. As a journalist for _The National Times_ she investigated NSW prisons, which led to a royal commission and a Walkley Award for Summers in 1976. She then worked as a political correspondent for the _Australian Financial Review_. Appointed head of the Office for the Status of Women in 1983, Summers was instrumental in the passage of the Anti-Discrimination Act; in the 1990s she worked as an adviser to Prime Minister Paul Keating. In New York from 1986 to 1992, Summers was editor-in-chief of _Ms_ magazine; and later edited the _Good Weekend_. Deputy President of Sydney's Powerhouse Museum from 1999, she also chaired the board of Greenpeace International from 2000. Her autobiography, _Ducks on the Pond_, was published in 1999; and her book _The Lost Mother: A Story of Art and Love_ (2010) was shortlisted for the Victorian Premier's Literary Awards. In 2013 she published _The Misogyny Factor_, an analysis of the status of women in contemporary Australia. Her memoir _Unfettered and Alive_ was published in 2018. Based in New York, Summers is a columnist for the _Sydney Morning Herald_."

                            "Graham Sutherland OM (1903â€“1980) was an English artist, best known as the painter of the portrait of Sir Winston Churchill aged 80, subsequently destroyed by the sitter's wife, Clementine. Having begun an apprenticeship as a railway engineer, Sutherland studied at Goldsmith's School of Art for five years during the 1920s, concentrating on engraving and etching. He first exhibited drawings and engravings at the XXI Gallery, London, in 1925 and was a member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers from 1926 to 1933; during this period he taught, and illustrated books. In the 1930s he began painting surreal landscapes in oils and in 1936 was represented in the _International Surrealist Exhibition_ in London. During the Second World War he was an official war artist, often depicting scenes of bomb damage. He held his first New York exhibition at the Buchholz Gallery in 1946, and in the same year completed a representation of the crucifixion for St Matthew's Church, Northampton. In 1949, he painted a portrait of Somerset Maugham, which is credited with reviving English interest in portraiture and initiated a series including Lord Beaverbrook, Churchill and others. Between 1954 and 1957 he was commissioned to design the Coventry Cathedral tapestry, installed in 1962. He also designed posters, ceramics, book illustrations, and ballet costumes and dÃ©cor. Major retrospective exhibitions were held at the London Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1951, the Venice Biennale and the MusÃ©e National dâ€™Art Moderne, Paris in 1952, the Tate Gallery in 1953, and at the SÃ£o Paulo Bienal, Brazil in 1955."

Born in Darwin, she attended dance schools in Melbourne, Penang and Sydney before being accepted into the Australian Ballet School in 1973. After joining the Australian Ballet in 1975, she then worked as a soloist with Pina Bausch's dance theatre in Wuppertal, Germany between 1978 and 1984. As a freelance choreographer, she established her distinctive choreography in works such as _Two Feet_ (1988) and was commissioned for projects in France, the Netherlands and Germany. For three years from 1989 she was artistic director of Canberra's Meryl Tankard Company, followed by six years as artistic director of Adelaide's Australian Dance Theatre, later renamed the Meryl Tankard Australian Dance Theatre. Tankard's defining work in this period was _Furioso_, featuring aerial choreography. With composer Elena Kats Chernin, she created the full-length ballet _Wild Swans_ for the Australian Ballet in 2003. The _Oracle_ (2009), a revisioning of the _Rite of Spring_ for Australian dancer Paul White, won the Australian Dance Award for Outstanding Choreography in 2010 and toured internationally. Since graduating from the Australian Film, Television and Radio School in 2010, Tankard has made several films including the award-winning documentary _Michelle's Story_ (2015). She continues to create dance productions, including recreating _Two Feet_ for the 2019 Adelaide Festival and choreographing _Claudel_ for the Sydney Opera House in 2021."

                            "Tamara Tchinarova (1919â€“2017), dancer, was one of the original 'baby ballerinas' of the Ballet Russes de Monte Carlo. She began training with the great Russian teacher Olga Preobrajenska, formerly of the Imperial Russian Ballet, at age ten after her family emigrated to Paris from Bessarabia, Romania. Noticed by choreographer George Balachine, at seventeen she joined the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. Tchinarova came to Australia on the first and second tours of the Russian ballets in 1936 and 1938, and chose to remain in Sydney after the second tour. In 1943 she married the actor Peter Finch, who had recently made his film debut in _Dad and Dave Come to Town_. During the 1940s she danced with three Australian dance companies, the Kirsova Ballet, the Polish-Australian Ballet and the Borovansky Ballet. In 1948, Finch and Tchinarova moved to London before divorcing in 1959. She then began working as a Russian/English interpreter for touring ballet companies, including the Australian Ballet, and as a dance writer. Tchinarova came back to Australia for the last time in 1994 as a guest of The Australian Ballet, delivering a series of lectures. Her autobiography, _Dancing into the Unknown: My Life in the Ballets Russes and Beyond_, was published in 2007. She died ten years later in Marbella, Spain at the age of 98."

                            "Violet Teague (1872â€“1951) was among Edwardian Australia's most fashionable and assured portraitists, although the art historical establishment was slow to acknowledge it. The daughter of a doctor, Teague was born in Melbourne and educated at home by a governess before completing her schooling at Presbyterian Ladies College, Burwood. In her twenties she undertook studies in art in Brussels and London, before returning to Melbourne and studying at the National Gallery School and the Melbourne School of Art. By the late 1890s, she'd already begun to secure portrait commissions â€“ her painting of former goldfields commissioner Robert Rede was awarded an honourable mention at the Paris Salon of 1898 â€“ and the portraits she exhibited in the Victorian Artists' Society exhibition in 1896 had attracted favourable attention. Her portrait of Una Falkiner won a bronze medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915; a portrait of family friend Theo Sharf was exhibited in the Paris Salon in 1920 (winning a silver medal) and in the Royal Academy exhibition in 1921. In addition, Teague was a pioneering Australian exponent of Japanese-style woodblock prints and gave lectures on the technique for the Victorian Arts and Crafts Society. Her work featured in the 1907 _Women's Work_ _Exhibition_ and in the _British Empire Exhibition_ of 1924â€“1925. In 1932 she travelled in Central Australia, and was so shocked by the conditions in which Aboriginal people lived that she organised an exhibition in Melbourne that raised thousands of pounds to pay for a permanent water supply for the Hermannsburg community. During the First World War, she initiated a series of tableaux vivants of scenes from Australian and British history, which were presented to raise funds for civilian charities. Several of Teague's best paintings deftly combine tradition and modernity, portraying sophisticated, educated and independent women in settings and poses which ostensibly conformed to notions of 'appropriate' behaviour and femininity. Examples of Teague's work are held by the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. In 2000, the Ian Potter Museum of Art mounted the touring exhibition _The Art of Violet Teague_."

                            "Guboo Ted Thomas (1909â€“2002), land rights activist, was a tribal Elder of the Yuin nation and grew up on the Wallaga Lake Reserve near Narooma. His father was a Yuin man and his mother was of Chinese descent. Aged nine, he accompanied his father and other Elders on a 350-km walk from Mallacoota to the Hawkesbury River, learning about the sacred sites for which he was later responsible; he re-enacted the walk when he was 80 with a group of disadvantaged Aboriginal children. During the 1930s he toured New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland with the Wallaga Lake Gumleaf Band, performing at the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. After working as a commercial fisherman for many years, he became active in the land rights movement in the 1970s, working with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (now AIATSIS) to document significant sites on the New South Wales south coast. After a five-year campaign by Thomas, the title deeds to Wallaga Lake were handed over to the Yuin people in 1983. At the same time, he campaigned against logging on Mumbulla Mountain and for recognition of its cultural significance; then NSW Premier Neville Wran ordered logging to cease and it was gazetted as an Aboriginal Place in 1984. In the 1980s and 1990s Thomas met spiritual leaders such as the Dalai Lama, and held Dreaming camps around Australia and internationally to pass on his knowledge. Through his books and stories, Thomas strove to educate people to respect the earth, appreciate Aboriginal culture and live in harmony. Just before his death at the age of 93 he continued to protest against developments threatening Aboriginal sites near Wollongong."

As director or soloist, Tognetti has appeared with many of the worldâ€™s leading orchestras, and in 2016 was the first artist-in-residence at the Barbican Centreâ€™s Milton Court Concert Hall. He also performed the Australian premieres of Ligetiâ€™s _Violin Concerto_ and Lutoslawskiâ€™s _Partita_, and his recordings of Bachâ€™s solo violin works gained him three consecutive ARIA awards. Tognetti created the Huntington Festival in Mudgee, New South Wales and was Artistic Director of the Festival Maribor in Slovenia from 2008 to 2015. He has also collaborated with performers, film-makers and artists including Barry Humphries, Michael Leunig, Jennifer Peedom and Bill Henson, and co-composed scores for feature films, notably Peter Weirâ€™s _Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World_ (for which he coached Russell Crowe for his on screen violin playing). He was declared a National Living Treasure in 1999 and holds honorary doctorates from the universities of Sydney, Wollongong and Western Australia. Tognetti has otherwise been commended for the development and promotion of educational programs, support for emerging artists and contributions to charitable organisations."

                            "Albert Tucker AO (1914-1999) was one of the strongest Australian painters of last century. His expressionistic style of painting was formed during the wartime years, when the city of Melbourne took on a strange and unreal atmosphere. His first major series of paintings, collectively titled Images of Modern Evil, was painted between 1945 and 1947. Tucker lived in Europe and the United States throughout the 1950s. There he refined and extended his subjects, concentrating on Australian myths, which he saw as central to the definition of national identity. Although best known as a painter, Tucker was an enthusiastic photographer. He took many of the now-familiar photographs of Melbourne's artistic circles of the 1940s."

                            "The question of why I paint is always pretty ambiguous. I think itâ€™s answering an inner compulsion, because if I didnâ€™t find this particular form of activity â€“ to me itâ€™s one that is defining things to myself and defining myself â€“ Iâ€™m not quite sure what would happen to me if I didnâ€™t answer this kind of inner compulsion. And I suppose it relates to oneâ€™s attitude to life. I think that, despite all the negative and destructive powers that are constantly at work with us, that one is constantly striving to affirm life, to be in love with it, and these are the tokens of affection on our way, as it were.\\n\\nThe question of why I paint the particular things I do is also pretty ambiguous. I think I would say that Iâ€™m trying to exorcise my own particular devils, and I suppose some of them get into the painting. I hope they do, thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m trying to put them, and get rid of them.\\n\\nBut once out, of course, one can then feel this kind of relaxation, the affirmation flows in, and the devils in the painting can sometimes turn into angels.\\n\\nI suppose in the act of work that it is essentially a struggle to escape the enmeshment of oneâ€™s ego, and in the attempt to struggle free one seems externally, to the external world, to be a very egocentric person, because youâ€™re following a necessary compulsion without which one loses oneâ€™s own balance and direction in life; and in the act of working one is defining these shapes, ejecting them as it were, and getting rid of them; and this process of ejectment is one there which is defining and clarifying oneâ€™s own particular kind of energy which you are attempting to flow out into life.",

He was amongst the first troops to land at Gallipoli, where he was wounded; in 1918, serving on the Western Front, he was wounded again. After the war he returned to Sydney to pursue his vision of establishing successful commercial airlines, and proved a capable and energetic administrator. When he co-piloted the Southern Cross from California to Brisbane, he had not yet obtained a pilot's licence. However, he went on to make several more record-breaking flights, both with Kingsford Smith in Southern Cross, and in command of his own aircraft, Faith in Australia. Ulm's Airspeed Envoy Stella Australis went down in the sea between California and Hawaii. His body was never found."

                            "Rosemary Valadon (b. 1947) is a Sydney artist best known for large-scale oil paintings characterised by theatricality and opulence and informed with irony and feminism. Valadon studied the Meldrum style of tonal painting in the early 1970s and after travelling abroad returned to Sydney, where she completed a postgraduate diploma in art. Her interests at this time included philosophy, feminist discourse, art theory, spirituality and mythology. Between 1990 and 1996 she completed _The Goddess Series_, a major series of portraits of Australian women as mythological/archetypal figures, including Germaine Greer, Ruth Cracknell, Blanche d'Alpuget and Noni Hazlehurst. This was followed by paintings with themes including fairytales, wicked women and the four seasons. Valadon is a regular finalist in the Archibald, Sulman, Blake, Portia Geach and Mosman prizes, and in 1991 she won both the Portia Geach Prize and the Blake Prize for Religious Art."

In 1976, the couple was appointed to lead the Dance Company New South Wales (later the Sydney Dance Company) and they put together their first production, Poppy. Throughout their careers she has been Murphyâ€™s muse and collaborator, able to see the full sweep of a production and ensure its parts worked together while he concentrated on details. In the early years they often danced together; later, she danced with the company throughout the world, in roles and productions they had created together. In 1996 she was named amongst Australiaâ€™s top five female dancers of all time (along with Marillyn Jones, Marilyn Rowe, Kathleen Gorham and Lucette Aldous). In 2000 Murphy and Vernon celebrated their achievements in Body of Work: A retrospective. Two years later they put together a unique Swan Lake. They married in 2004, and in 2009 choreographed the film Maoâ€™s Last Dancer. Vernon and Murphy retired from the Sydney Dance Company in 2007 but the couple has continued to create works for Chinese, German and Australian companies."

                            "Lady Deborah Vernon Hackett (1887â€“1965) was a mining company director and philanthropist. She grew up in Western Australia, where in 1905, aged eighteen, she married 58-year-old John Winthrop Hackett, newspaper proprietor and politician. Together they had five children. During the First World War she raised funds for the war effort and wrote _The Australian Household Guide_, the profits from which went to various charities. Widowed in 1916, she moved to Adelaide and married Frank Moulden, who was made Mayor of Adelaide a few years later. As Lady Mayoress from 1920 to 1922, she raised Â£100,000 for Adelaide's charities and presided over the local branch of the National Council of Women. Over the course of the 1920s Lady Moulden became interested in tantalite, a scarce mineral. Intrepidly visiting potential sites in in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, she became convinced of its viability as an export, and travelled to the USA to secure a contract to supply ore. She incorporated Tantalite Ltd while living in London in 1932, and returned to Australia to form a syndicate to mine wolfram in Central Australia. During the Second World War her tantalite was used to make radar equipment. After Frank died in 1932 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Western Australia. Four years later she married barrister Basil Buller Murphy; henceforth known as Dr Buller Murphy, she lived in Toorak, raising funds for the women's auxiliaries of various hospitals and serving on diverse welfare committees. They moved to an orchard property named 'Lordello' at Kilsyth in the Dandenong Ranges after the war. Her third husband wrote a book about her interests in tantalite called _A Lady of Rare Metal_ (1949). In 1958 she published a book of stories of the Dordenup Aboriginal people who she had known when young. She died at home in Kilsyth and was buried alongside her parents in Perth."

It breaks much new ground. It treats practically with problems with which the Australian mother of a family and the Australian housekeeper are confronted day by day, year in and year out. No effort has been spared to make the work the most generally useful publication on the subject of domestic economy which has emanated from the Australian press.\\n\\nThe series of articles which it contains embraces such various subjects as: _Foods; their Functions and Values, The Australian Baby, The Kindergarten, What Young People Should Know, General Hygiene, Home Nursing, Hints upon Personal Appearance, The Home Garden, Poultry Keeping, Domestic Animals and The Typhoid or House Fly_ and _Insect Pests_.\\n\\nEach of these articles has been written by an expert, who speaks with authority upon the subject treated of. The recipes, some 3,500 in number and dealing with every branch of the culinary art and every department of household management have not been collected or collated haphazard [sic] but carefully selected by competent advisers, the great majority being actually contributed and vouched for by the correspondents, whose reliability and knowledge every reasonable care has been taken to ascertain and determine.\\n\\nSince the entire net proceeds of _The Australian Household Guide_ are to be devoted to charities it is hoped that its reception in Australian homes and its appreciation by Australian mothers will warrant the early publication of a second edition.",

                            "John Vickery (1906-1983), illustrator, designer and painter was the only Australian to be part of the New York School in 1960s which includes painters such as Jackson Pollock, Joan Mitchell and Willem de Kooning. Vickery was an important painter in Australia's engagement with the Op Art movement.\\n\\nA student at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, the artist had good success as a portrait artist early in his career. A finalist in the Archibald Prize three times: in 1932 with a portrait of Miss Leila Pirani, and twice in 1933 with his self portrait, and a portrait of Miss Joan Burbury. After a brief stay in London, he moved to the United States of America in the 1930s, where he pursued his arts practice while working in advertising in New York, as an illustrator. From 1943 through to the end of the Second World War, he sketched the portraits of more than 650 patients in military hospitals in the US and the South West Pacific, as part of the USO. Vickery's contribution continued after the end of the war, as Chairman of group counselling for The Society of Illustrators Veterans' Program, supporting upskilling, education, and reengagement.\\n\\nBy the 1950s, Vickery had become friends with Philip Guston and come into contact with other members of the expressionist New York School, including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Yves Kline. Despite his proven capacity as a fine portrait artist, Vickery primarily worked in Op Art, and named the New York School as a significant influence. He exhibited regularly in the US over the course of his career, and three decades after his death, his contribution was recognised at his alma mater: an exhibition of his work was the inaugural show at the Victorian College of the Arts' Founders Gallery in 2013. Vickery's work is represented in the collections of the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia, Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TÄmaki. The University of Melbourne offers the John Vickery Scholarship for Art students enrolled in Painting or Drawing, based on financial need and academic achievement."

                            "Richard von Marientreu was born in Poland and attended military academies in Cracow and Vienna before leaving for Prague, where he studied at the Academy of Painting. In London from 1933, von Marientreu was introduced into fashionable society by his patron, Mrs Marie Ludlow-Symonds. He was soon in demand as a portrait painter, many of his subjects coming from high-ranking sections of the military and society, including royalty. Between 1935 and 1955, he created portraits of sitters such as King George V; Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother; and Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery. He also exhibited regularly throughout this period, often with large scale genre paintings dealing with subjects such as mythology, war and historical scenes. His obituary in The Times recalled him as â€˜a very gentle man, and immaculately turned out, choosing always to paint, no matter what the subject, in one of the same Savile Row tailored suits that he might wear to one of his exhibition openingsâ€™."

                            "Wes Walters (1928-2014), painter, studied architecture in Geelong and art at the Ballarat School of Mines before embarking on a successful career as a freelance commercial artist in 1950. In 1963 he was won the Australian Commercial and Industrial Artists' Association's Award of Distinctive Merit, and thirty years later he was inducted into the Illustrators' Hall of Fame. In the 1970s Walters moved away from full time advertising work to concentrate on painting, holding solo shows of landscapes and photorealist nudes. Gradually he developed a specialisation in portraiture, undertaking many commissions. When he won the Archibald Prize in 1979 for a portrait of Phillip Adams - pipping Keith Looby's portrait of Padraic McGuinness - Adams predicted correctly that the 'arties' would be furious because of Walters's background in commercial art. Walters has stated that 'My main objective as a portrait painter is to paint as well as my hero, Velasquez, in my estimation by far the world's greatest portraitist. I feel this is unlikely to be brought to fruition, although sometimes there are instances when I feel I get a little closer.' The National Portrait Gallery acquired his painting of Sir Zelman Cowen PC AK GCMG GCVO QC DCL by gift of Joseph Brown and Marc Besen AO in 2000. In 2006, also by gift from Joseph Brown, the Gallery acquired Waltersâ€™s undated portrait of Arthur Boyd."

                            "When John Webber R.A. (c. 1752-1793), the son of a Swiss sculptor, living in London, submitted his work to the Royal Academy Schools, one of the first to admire his paintings was Dr Daniel Solander, the Swedish naturalist who had accompanied Cook and Banks on the first voyage. Knowing that no artist had yet been selected for Cook's voyage, Solander recommended Webber to the Admiralty and Royal Society. His appointment was made just days before the departure. Webber was lucky enough to escape the massacre in Hawaii, where Cook met his death, and returned to London in October 1780. On his return he was employed by the Admiralty to make finished drawings and engravings to illustrate the official journey of the trip. He completed a series of paintings for the Admiralty, was elected a member of the Royal Academy and continued to paint landscapes in England and abroad until his death in 1793. HIs posthumous portrait of Captain James Cook, painted in 1782, shows not only the hand of a fine artist, but also a sensitivity and understanding of the sitter - a man Webber had known well and greatly admired."

He opened his own studio in 1968, taking advertising and magazine photographs and working with the Australian Opera and the Australian Ballet. In 1970 he was invited to work in the creative venue the Yellow House with Martin Sharp, Brett Whiteley, George Gittoes and Peter Kingston, photographing its artists, installations and activities and there mounting his first exhibition, a series of photographs of the Cronulla sand dunes. Over the next three decades he photographed artists and their works for catalogues and books, assembling a collection of portraits published as _Australian Artists: Portraits by Greg Weight_ in 2004. Weight won the inaugural Australian Photographic Portrait Prize in 2003 for a photograph of Jim Conway, and the Head On photographic portrait prize for his photograph of Jaiwei Shen in 2006. In 2011 Weight was a finalist in the National Photographic Portrait Prize. The Manly Art Gallery and Museum commissioned him to photograph Northern Beaches artists in their studios in 2020, which were exhibited as the _Portraits Project_. Weight's photographs are held in the collections of the National Library, the National Gallery of Australia and state and regional galleries. The National Portrait Gallery acquired 101 of his photographs by gift of Patrick Corrigan in 2004."

                            "Benjamin West (1738-1820), an American painter, arrived in England in 1763 after a Grand Tour in Italy and soon won acclaim. In the late 1760s he brought forth his best-known work, the Death of General Wolfe, which became the model for various other death scenes of national heroes, including, to a degree, that of Captain Cook. West preferred producing history paintings to portraits; it was an indication of Banks' social standing at the conclusion of the Endeavour voyage, as well as the depth of his purse, that West agreed to paint him. West was closely associated with Joshua Reynolds, and it was a natural progression, for Banks, from a portrait by West to one by Reynolds. When Reynolds died in 1792, West succeeded him as President of the Royal Academy."

                            "Bryan Westwood (1930-2000) was a painter and printmaker who twice won the Archibald Prize, for his portrait of artist and critic Elwyn Lynn (1989) and of the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating (1992). Largely self-taught, Westwood did not start painting professionally until his mid thirties and held his first exhibition in 1967. Prior to this he had an eclectic career in economics, advertising and the film industry. His decision to pursue an artistic vocation was prompted by a friendship with Jeffrey Smart and Justin O'Brien, with whom he had some lessons. His work was characterised by a dispassionate scrutiny of objects and a mannerly approach in their portrayal. Like fellow painter and friend, Margaret Olley (who sat for him on a number of occasions) he emphasised craft, conscientiousness and respect for tradition in his practice. His portraiture has been described as photorealist. He was the official artist appointed by the Federal Government to the 75th Anniversary of the Gallipoli landings in 1990, travelling with the veterans. The resulting paintings and sketches were exhibited at the Australian War Memorial. Westwood's work is represented in State and University collections throughout Australia and in the National Gallery of Australia, as well as in a number of corporate collections. His portraits of Prime Ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Fraser are currently on loan to the National Portrait Gallery and are on display in Kings Hall."

                            "Brett Whiteley AO, artist, displayed a brilliant talent for drawing as a Sydney private schoolboy. After studying half-heartedly at art school he travelled to Europe on a scholarship. In London he excited art dealers and fell under the influence of painters such as Francis Bacon. He won the international prize at the second Paris Biennale for Young Artists in 1961, and married his beautiful muse, Wendy Julius, the following year. Through the 1960s he exhibited around the world before returning to live on the Sydney harbourside. He began the 1970s with gentle pictures of birds, moving on to massive portraits of the poets Verlaine and Rimbaud before taking two years to paint the eighteen-panel Alchemy 1972-1973. He then turned to series of paintings of waves, interiors, the harbour, and coastal landscapes. In 1978, his annus mirabilis, he became the first artist to win the Archibald Prize for portraiture, the Wynne Prize for landscape and the Sulman Prize for genre painting all in the same year. He died of an overdose in a motel in Thirroul, New South Wales in the winter of 1992."

                            "Itâ€™s impossible to talk about art because Iâ€™ve always taken it for granted. Iâ€™ve always understood, basically, that I used to be something else, that Iâ€™m a continuation of a particular kind of thread of human spirit, that the only thing that Iâ€™m involved in is the notion of interpreting time, in a sense that Iâ€™m alive. That the spirit will continue and itâ€™ll be the same as what it was, and various painters have given their flash at it and that in a summary is basically what Iâ€™m doing. Along with that, is like, the immense sense of the requirement towards survival so one gets more interested in the capacity for power, or in the various ways that can be appropriated. And that art has to follow that, has to employ it, if itâ€™s of any value.\\n\\nThereâ€™s no such a thing as Australian art because thereâ€™s probably no such a thing as Australia. Thereâ€™s a kind of ancient piece of immense and interesting and very strange land, which has had a few people come down on it and in a very surreal way started a kind of sensual civilisation. Itâ€™s got to a kind of point where weâ€™re suffering like the rest of the world with a kind of paralysis of confidence.\\n\\nI think that humankind are trying to force and press open a new area of brain think â€“ a capacity to sense, a broader knowing. In order to do that weâ€™re going to have in Godâ€™s, or in the puzzleâ€™s term, some sort of a major reckoning up. Weâ€™ve got death absolutely in our hands, a complete capacity to bang it out, and weâ€™re trying to force open this newer channel. I see, to a certain degree, that I along with numbers of other individuals, are trying to, you know, cause inside their own pressure, that breaking through, that kind of time. I mean, thereâ€™s immense relaxation inside it, but thereâ€™s also like the heat towards want, the necessity of the mystery of life, of the system of life, which is always, like, come and go.

                            "Fred Williams OBE, painter and etcher, was one of the most important Australian artists of the twentieth century. His unique landscape vision emerged in the late 1950s, after his return from a period of study and work in London. The 1960s saw an increasing minimalism in his paintings, which reached its most extreme point at the end of the decade. In his monumental works of 1969, he attempted to evoke the vast scale of the Australian land through canvases of a single colour dotted with tiny flecks of paint. Although Williams later turned to representation of denser, more colourful terrain, his bare, uncompromising pictures of the 1960s contributed profoundly to subsequent interpretation of the Australian landscape. Williams made a number of portraits of friends and family members, particularly during the 1970s. He completed his first portrait commission, of Sir Louis Matheson, first Vice Chancellor of Monash University, in 1976; portraits of University of Melbourne figures followed. The National Portrait Gallery has his self portrait at the easel, and his portrait of Murray Bail, with whom he served on the Council of the National Gallery of Australia. Subjects of his other masterly portraits include Rudy Komon and John Brack."

                            "Richard Windeyer (1806-1847), journalist, barrister and politician, was the eldest of the ten children born to Charles Windeyer and his wife Ann Mary and remained in England when the rest of his family went to New South Wales. While studying for his law degree, he worked as his father had, as a parliamentary reporter and journalist. Married in 1832, Richard was called to the Bar in 1834 - also the year that his only child, William Charles, was born. Encouraged by the opportunity to practice as a barrister in New South Wales, Richard left for the colony in 1835. In Sydney, Richard established a considerable practice and was noted as 'a barrister of superior abilities' and eloquence. Like his father, Richard acquired land in the Hunter Valley. Here, Windeyer built Tomago House (1843) and successfully cultivated 30 acres of vines, producing his first wine in 1845 with the assistance of several imported European workers. Richard was elected to the colony's first Legislative Council in 1843. He supported free trade and worked to open the British market to the colony's wheat. He was also interested in education, social welfare and law reform and became a member of the Aborigines Protection Society after appearing in trials arising from the Myall Creek atrocity of 1838. An 'able, enlightened, honest and uncompromising public man', Richard Windeyer died from a combination of illness, overwork and financial worries at the age of forty-one."

Thousands of people lined up to see his eight foot tall frame and witness his displays of linguistics (he was reportedly able to speak ten languages) and he was soon touring Europe and America. Accompanied by his wife, Kin Foo, he arrived in Australia from the United States in 1870 and toured the country over the next several years. While in Australia, after the death of his first wife, Chang met and married Catherine Santley and returned with her to China. They had two sons before moving to England. He attracted the attention of American showman and entrepreneur P.T Barnum who, in 1880, contracted Chang to join his so-called 'Greatest Show On Earth', a travelling circus, menagerie and museum of freakish human 'specimens'. Returning to England, Chang retired from the stage and, to help cure his suspected tuberculosis, moved with his family to Bournemouth. Here, he opened a tearooms and 'Oriental Bazaar' selling Chinese curios and fabrics. He died, reportedly of a broken heart, four months after the death of his wife in 1893"

While still a student, she won the Le Gay Brereton Prize for Drawing; she has since participated in countless solo and group exhibitions. From 1961 to 1971 she taught at various secondary schools and colleges; from 1972 to 1978 she taught at the West Australian Institute of Technology in Perth; from 1979 to 1985 she taught at Hornsby College of TAFE. Meanwhile, from 1967 she travelled widely through remote areas of Australia and abroad. She won the Wynne Prize in 1971 and the Portia Geach Memorial Awards in both 1983 and 1984. Recipient of a number of smaller prizes, she has been an Archibald finalist seven times, several times with self-portraits, of which she has made many over the course of her career (the â€˜hornedâ€™ turban is characteristic.) The Art Gallery of New South Wales has four of her works and she is represented in a number of regional galleries. Gavin Fryâ€™s monograph _Margaret Woodward_ was published by the Beagle Press in 2003."

                            "Thomas Woolner, sculptor, studied first with the brothers Henry and William Behnes, painter and sculptor respectively, and later at the Royal Academy, at which he was to become professor of sculpture in his fifties. As a young man he was a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and contributed poems to its journal, The Germ, including â€˜My Beautiful Ladyâ€™, expanding at some length on the themes â€˜I love my lady, she is very fair/ Her brow is wan, and bound by simple hairâ€™. His small sculpture Eleanor sucking the Poison from Prince Edwardâ€™s Wound (1843), exhibited at the Royal Academy, attracted much attention, but by 1850 he was engaged mostly on medallion portraits. \\n\\nWoolner came to Australia in1852 to try his luck on the Victorian goldfields, but was appalled by the conditions and soon resumed his sculptural work, making a number of plaster medallions of prominent Melbourne citizens including La Trobe. In 1854, Woolner spent a happy six months in Sydney, where various families and individuals commissioned portrait medallions. In all, during his stay in Australia, Woolner produced 24 portrait medallions. Some portraits, including those of LaTrobe and Wentworth, were copied more often than others. There were 25 subscribers listed for the LaTrobe medallion in the Melbourne Banner of 28 February 1854. Over a few months in 1854, print-sellers Woolcott and Clark at 555 George Street Sydney advertised that those interested in subscribing to a specimen of the Wentworth medallion could inspect the plaster version at their premises in Sydney. Woolner was heading for England on the Queen of the South; there, he would have his plaster impressions cast by the finest artisans in bronze, for shipment back to the colony. The price was five guineas per medallion and Woolcott and Clark promised that subscribers would receive their portraits within twelve months. Although he was commended for the likeness of Wentworth in the portrait medallion, he failed to obtain the hoped-for commission for the full-length statue of Wentworth that now stands in the Great Hall of the University of Sydney. \\n\\nHaving returned to England with his case of colonial medallions, Woolner continued his portrait sculpture practice. He made medallions of Tennyson, Browning, Carlyle, Palgrave and Hooker, amongst others; Gladstone, Darwin, Dickens, Huxley, Charles Kingsley, and Lord Cavendish were amongst his subjects. He made the statue of Lord Lawrence, Viceroy of India for Government House, Calcutta; that of Sir Stamford Raffles currently in Empress Place, Singapore; the statue of John Stuart Mill that stands on the Thames Embankment; and a bust of Alfred, Lord Tennyson for Westminster Abbey. He made the life-sized statue of Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, for the New Museum at Oxford and in 1879 he was commissioned to make the statue of Captain Cook that stands near the Australian Museum in Sydney. Woolner died the day after Tennyson, in October 1892. The National Portrait Gallery, London, has eight of his medallions and eleven of his busts, as well as a plethora of photographs of him."

We came to a shepherdâ€™s hut that was in a spot which might by labour be turned into a paradise. The manâ€™s wife and family were there. It has something wild and comfortable in aspect. One little girl was swinging, a graceful little creature. I will make a bas relief of her when I get back to England and the fine arts. The place where we are camped in is the most beautiful we have seen, and the wildest.\\n\\nChristmas â€“ and warm soft air, brilliant sunlight, plentiful flowering foliage, butterflies, innumerable common flies, voices of birds, almost as various and manifold as the vegetation. I can scarcely write for the flies buzzing about and irritating my eyes. The grass is pale yellow and more like hay than grass with the sunâ€™s heat. It dazzles my eyes to look across the plain where the heat is shaking the distance. All this should be strange to an Englishman, but somehow it seems all a matter of course to me. I knew before I left my own country that Time and Place were reversed here, so all I see appears appropriate. If anything comes better than I have been accustomed to, I enjoy; if worse, I endure it.\\n\\nI have seen 27 Christmas days now but never expected to see one like this. While I write in the full shine of a glorious day, my friends are in their beds sleeping, or perhaps a few rather â€˜jolly fellowsâ€™ may be winding home through the streets with raw, dark, dirty drizzle falling on them, after spending Christmas Eve. Well, I hope they may enjoy their plum pudding. I wish I could get my letters. Ah! If I could it would be better than a princeâ€™s feast to me, a Christmas luxury truly.",

                            "Judith Wright (1915â€“2000), poet, conservationist and Aboriginal land rights campaigner, was born at Thalgaroch Station, near Armidale, NSW, into a pastoralist family whose origins go back to the first settlement in the Hunter Valley in the 1820s. After studying English at the University of Sydney, she travelled in Europe from 1937 to 1938, before settling in Sydney to write. She wrote 'an occasional modest, thoughtful poem', but when Japan entered the war, she returned to help on the family property, Wollomombi. During this time, she rediscovered her love of the countryside and also had the opportunity to think deeply about her art, leading to the first intensely creative period of her writing. From 1943 to 1947 she worked at the University of Queensland, where she met and married the philosopher and writer J.P. McKinney. Her first major volume of poetry, _The Moving Image_ (1946) was said to have 'brought a sense of excitement and anticipation to the Australian literary world of the time'. It was followed by _Woman to Man_ (1949), which won the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry, _The Gateway_ (1953), _The Two Fires_ (1955), _Birds_ (1961), The _Other Half_ (1966), and _Alive_ (1973), among many others. She also wrote novels, short stories, children's stories and literacy criticism. A conservationist, Wright co-founded the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland and was president from 1964 and 1976. Through the 1960s and early 1970s she was devoted to protecting the Great Barrier Reef from oil drilling and campaigned against land mining on Fraser Island, which she evoked in her poem 'Australia 1970'. She was also an active supporter of Aboriginal land rights. The Canberra suburb 'Wright' is named after her."

                            "Alexis Wright (b. 1950), author and activist, won the Miles Franklin Award in 2007 for her novel Carpentaria and the 2018 Stella Prize for her collective memoir _Tracker_. A woman of the Waanyi nation of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Wright was raised by her mother and grandmother in Cloncurry, her non-Aboriginal cattleman father having died when she was five years old. Her first novel, _Plains of Promise_, was published in 1997 and was shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers Prize, a New South Wales Premierâ€™s Literary Award and the Age Book of the Year. Throughout the ensuing decade Wrightâ€™s short stories and essays were included in a number of anthologies and in journals such as _Overland_, _Australian Humanities Review_ and _Southerly_, and her criticism appeared in _The Age_ and _Meanjin_, among other publications. _Carpentaria,_ a 500-page-long novel about an Aboriginal family from the Gulf, was written in a style incorporating â€˜the way we tell stories and in the voice of our own people and our own way of speakingâ€™, and was initially rejected by several publishers. On its eventual appearance in 2006, however, it won a slew of awards including the Victorian, New South Wales and Queenslandâ€™s Premierâ€™s Literary Awards for Fiction; the Australian Book Industry Award for Book of the Year; and the Australian Literary Societyâ€™s gold medal, in addition to the Miles Franklin. Her third novel The _Swan Book_ (2014) was also awarded the ALS gold medal and was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin and the Victorian and New South Wales Premierâ€™s Awards. In addition, through her work as a researcher, activist and consultant with various Aboriginal organisations, she has published widely on Indigenous issues and land rights in Australia and overseas. Her non-fiction titles as author and editor include _Grog War_ (1997), examining alcohol abuse in the Northern Territory, and _Take Power_ (1998), an anthology of writing on land rights in Central Australia. Wright has undergraduate qualifications in social studies and creative writing and a doctorate from RMIT. She is currently a Distinguished Fellow of the Writing and Society Research Centre at the University of Western Sydney."

                            "William Yang (b. 1943) is a pre-eminent Australian photographer known for an intensely sustained body of work that examines issues of cultural and sexual identity, and which unflinchingly documents the lives of his friends and community and his own lived experience with curiosity, sensitivity and humour. He is known in particular for his documentation of the Sydney LGBTIQ+ community from the 1970s onwards, including the evolution of the Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras, and for photographic series engaging with the impact of HIV/AIDS on his friends and community, his sense of identity as a Chinese-Australian, and his family history and relationships.\\n\\nBorn in Mareeba, near Cairns, Yang grew up in a family who repudiated their Chinese heritage so as to escape the intolerance characteristic of mid-twentieth century Australia. He realised he was Chinese at age six, after being subjected to a bigoted taunt at school. He has recalled becoming aware of what homosexuality meant as a high school student in Cairns, when he came across an article that made him feel as if 'there were only four homosexuals in the world: Oscar Wilde, Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo â€“ and me'. He was given his first camera at seventeen, but became more serious about photography as a student at the University of Queensland, where he studied architecture and began writing and directing plays. In the late 1960s, he moved to Sydney. Having decided to make a living as a photographer, he attended numerous parties and events to take images of celebrities for the social pages of magazines, creating at the same time an unmistakeable and candid record of the city's creative cliques and subcultures. 'The arena suited me; it was more theatrical', Yang wrote in his Sydney Diary 1974â€“1984. 'Even as a playwright I'd always thought that real life set up better situations than you could ever think of yourself.'\\n\\nBy the mid-1970s his connections to the theatre and the creative arts had resulted in portraits of sitters such as artists Martin Sharp and Brett Whiteley; designers Linda Jackson and Jenny Kee; and theatre director Jim Sharman, whose friends and collaborators Yang also photographed. Two of the very first photographs purchased for the National Portrait Gallery's collection, for example, were Yang's portraits of actor Judy Davis (b. 1959), who in 1981 performed the title role in Sharman's production of _Lulu_ for the Sydney Theatre Company and the State Theatre Company of South Australia, and writer and Nobel laureate Patrick White (1912â€“1990), whom Yang first photographed in 1977, backstage after a performance of White's play _Big Toys_, directed by Sharman. Yang's first exhibition, _Sydneyphiles_, at the Australian Centre for Photography in 1977, established Yang (then Willy Young) as the preeminent freelance photographer and social documenter of the period. He changed his name from Young to Yang in 1983. He has since exhibited widely in Australia and abroad, also becoming known as a storyteller through his performance works which combine spoken word monologue, memoir and slide projection â€“ such as _Friends of Dorothy_, _Shadows_ and _Blood Links_ â€“ and series of photographs characterised by the use of text in the form of handwritten inscriptions.\\n\\nYang's work has been included in many significant group exhibitions such as _World without end_ (AGNSW, 2000); _Don't leave me this way: art in the age of AIDS_ (NGA, 1994); _Life Lines_ (QAGOMA, 2009); _On the edge: Australian photographers of the 1970s_ (San Diego Museum of Art, 1998); _Sydney Photographed_ (MCA, 1994); and _From Bondi to Uluru_ (Higashikawa Arts Centre, Hokkaido, 1993). A retrospective of his photographs, _Diaries_, was held at the State Library of New South Wales in 1998. In 2001 the National Portrait Gallery mounted the exhibition _William Yang: Australian Chinese_ which then toured widely in Australia. Yang has produced books including _Patrick White: The late years_ (1995), _Sadness_ (1996), _Friends of Dorothy_ (1997) and _China_ (2008). His works are held in major state galleries, the National Gallery of Australia and the National Portrait Gallery, for which Yang created the commissioned work _My Generation_ in 2008. In 2021 Queensland Art Gallery held the major survey exhibition _William Yang: Seeing and Being Seen_, and published a book of the same name."

                            "Generally, my style of photography is Iâ€™m just photographing whatâ€™s around me in my everyday life.\\n\\nProbably the 80s was my most productive time when all those photographs came out because I was brushing shoulders with celebrities. But after that period, I started to do performance pieces. My photography changed a bit because one of the things that I undertook was to photograph my own family which represented the Chinese in Australia. I claimed my heritage in the 80s because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged.\\n\\nAnd the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields in the place where my uncle had been shot. I somehow knew that this was an important event because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event. And that was a very important moment in my life. I kept doing self-portraits and Iâ€™ve done about 40 of them.\\n\\nGradually I evolved to tell my own story and just photograph things about my own life. Iâ€™m very happy that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so I feel that Iâ€™m living my art as well as my life. And so thatâ€™s very satisfying for me.\\n\\nI had to come to terms with being Chinese, being gay and just feeling comfortable as a human being. There are lots of people who arenâ€™t comfortable about that, still. And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. Thatâ€™s been my philosophy.",

                            "Angus Young (b. 1955), guitarist and songwriter, was a founding member of Australia's most successful ever band, AC/DC. Glasgow-born, he and his older brother Malcolm formed the band in Sydney in 1973, with Angus soon adopting his trademark school uniform and energetic antics onstage. The bandâ€™s line-up was confirmed in 1974 when Ronald 'Bon' Scott joined AC/DC as lead singer. Between 1975 and 1977 they released their first five studio albums, all co-written by Angus, Malcolm and Bon. With four huge singles in Australia, the band was signed to an international deal, but American success did not come until the title track from their sixth album Highway to Hell reached number 17 on the US charts in 1979. The multi-platinum album was the last to feature Scott, who died of alcohol poisoning in London in February 1980. Significantly, however, largely thanks to Angus Young's star status, the band weathered the loss of Scott and his replacement by Brian Johnston. Back in Black was released five months after Scott's death and vastly outsold the bandâ€™s previous albums, going platinum 22 times in the USA alone. AC/DC have since released a further nine studio albums. In 2014 Malcolm Young retired due to worsening dementia; he was replaced as rhythm guitarist by his nephew Stevie. Johnston left in 2014 having been advised that he risked total hearing loss if he continued with the band. Angus Young is the only band member remaining from the heydays of the late 70s and early 80s. A biography of him, High Voltage: the life of Angus Young, was released in 2017. Back in Black is still held to be the second-highest-selling album of all time worldwide, after Michael Jackson's Thriller; and it is the USAâ€™s fifth-highest selling album ever."

                            "Photo media artist Anne Zahalka was born in Sydney in 1957, following her parentâ€™s migration to post-war Australia. After studying at East Sydney Technical College and Sydney College of the Arts, Zahalka began participating in group exhibitions in Australia and Germany in the early 1980s. Returning to university, she would later graduate with a Master of Fine Arts from the University of New South Wales in 1994.\\n\\nIn her practice Zahalka reconstructs recognisable imagery to explore concepts of identity, cultural and gender diversity, and the environment. Concepts of appropriation and the subversion of art historical motifs and signifiers are interwoven with the artist's restaging of historic portraiture and photography. The resulting works are intelligent, humorous and accessible. With a growing interest in ecology and the impact of humans on the environment Zahalka's 2019 series _Wild Life, Australia_ moved away from portraiture to reimagine Australian natural history dioramas; to reflect on the changing relationship between society and the natural world.\\n\\nShe has held over 40 solo exhibitions including the touring shows _Woven Threads_, _Leisureland_ and _Wild Life, Australia_. _Welcome to Sydney_ was shown in the International Terminal of Sydney Airport in 2003 and _Hall of Mirrors: Anne Zahalka Portraits_ was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery on the Canberra leg of an extensive tour in 2007. Zahalka's work was included in the international photography exhibition _Civilization: The Way We Live Now_, shown at the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, in 2018 and the National Gallery of Victoria in 2019. In the same year, the artist undertook a residency at the BÃ©hal FejÃ©r Institute in Prague, tracing her family's story of persecution, exile and survival.\\n\\nZahalka has won the Leopold Godowsky Photography Award in Boston (2005), the National Photographic Prize (2007) and the Macarthur Cook Art Prize (2008). Her work is represented in regional, state, national and international collections including the National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Art Gallery of South Australia, Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art, The National Art Gallery, New Zealand, and the Sir Elton John Collection."
