In the early 1950s he became a company director with BHP, a position he held for thirty-two years. For fifteen years during this period he was also Chairman of Rheem Australia and Koitaki Ltd. His interest in the visual arts led him to accept the position of inaugural Chairman of the Board of the Australian National Gallery from 1982 to 1986. At the end of this period he established The Gordon Darling Australian Print Fund, which has acquired more than 6000 prints for the national collection to date. In 1991 he established the Gordon Darling Foundation, which provides funding and staff development opportunities for public art institutions Australia-wide. That year, too, he and his wife, Marilyn, initiated and facilitated the touring exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery. The interest generated by the exhibition led to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery. Amongst the very earliest acquisitions of the Gallery were gifts from Darling, who accepted the inaugural Board's invitation to become the Founding Patron of the Gallery in mid-1998. Since then he has enabled the acquisition of many key works for the Collection, and his support carried the Gallery to the opening of its new, dedicated home in December 2008. \\n\\nJiawei Shen (b. 1948) who painted the portrait of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark for the National Portrait Gallery in 2005, often places his sitters within evocative dreamlike or remembered settings. The backdrop of his portrait of Darling suggests the competition-winning design for the dedicated National Portrait Gallery â€“ the project the Founding Patron long envisaged and urged. Set apart from the rest of the Collection in the Gordon Darling Hall, and seeming to capture some of the natural light of the space, his portrait hangs adjacent to the boards listing the many donors and benefactors to the institution.",

I have chosen to depict myself in this self portrait as I know I have fallen victim to the pressures of my environment and society.

Fusing mythological and personal symbolism, the work explores the complexities of personal growth, transformation and femininity. This is more than a literal likeness. The artist explains: 'The spirituality within the work is about being human: walking is spiritual, sitting is spiritual, eating is spiritual. Tree worship is universal, as is our symbiotic relation with trees. It's in our language; mother nature, family tree, the tree of life â€¦ Here I'm asking, \"Am I the same as the tree?\" and answering, \"I am the tree\".' \\n\\nPhilosophical concepts, binary opposites and pop culture have been recurring themes throughout Nellâ€™s 25-year multidisciplinary practice. Motifs such as the ghost face figure, which in this self portrait float amid Nell's fantastical tree limbs, appear and reappear in different creative projects. While it conveys ephemerality, this work relied on the labour-intensive processes of bronze forging and glassblowing, playing with the tension between permanence and transience.",

Redressing the absence of women artists in cultural histories has also been a longstanding preoccupation for Rrap. _Blow Back_ is a collective portrait of 33 contemporary women artists, all peers of Rrap, who have each helped shape the landscape of recent artistic practice in Australia. Many of these women, including Rrap herself who appears in the work, were particularly influential to the development of conceptual photographic practice from the 1980s onwards.  \\n  \\nIn making these enigmatic photographic portraits, Rrap asked each sitter to perform the act of breathing out. She then hand etched a sheet of glass with an impression of her sitterâ€™s exhale â€“ what she calls an â€˜exchange â€¦ me making the breath for themâ€™ â€“ which is overlaid on the print. As each breath is unique to the person producing it, its visualisation creates a poignant layer of identity and representation. Sustenance in its most simple form, the breath becomes an abstract portrait alongside the more explicitly representative photographs.  \\n  \\nJulie Rrap has exhibited widely in Australia and overseas since 1982, in an experimental creative practice that has traversed photography, video, installation and sculpture. Rrap is one of the most influential artists of her generation. Her early photographic installations, in which she used her own body to contest the objectified presentation of women in the history of art, are critical to the development of Australian feminist artistic practice. She has received numerous awards and honours over the course of career including the Lady Fairfax Open Photography Award from the Art Gallery of New South Wales (1982); Artist's Residency, CitÃ© des Arts, Paris; Power Institute, University of Sydney (1986); The Redlands Westpac Art Prize (2008) and the University of Queensland National Artistsâ€™ Self-portrait prize (2009). Major survey exhibitions include: _The Vizard Foundation Contemporary Artist Project_ (2015), _Julie Rrap: Remaking the World_, at the Potter Museum of Art and _Julie Rrap: Body Double_ presented at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, (2007). Rrapâ€˜s practice has attracted substantial critical writing including dedicated publications for the MCA and Potter Museum exhibitions. Her work is held in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia and all major Australian state galleries.  \\n  \\nTop row (Lâ€“R): Barbara Campbell, Hilarie Mais, Petrina Hicks, Debra Phillips, Justyna Stanczew, Elizabeth Pulie, Cherine Fahd, Salote Tawale, Merilyn Fairskye, Lynne Roberts-Goodwin, Kusum Normoyle  \\n  \\nMiddle row (Lâ€“R): Elizabeth Day, Anne Graham, Mikala Dwyer, Maria Fernanda Cardoso, Justene Williams, Jacky Redgate, Joyce Hinterding, Jill Scott, Sarah Goffman, Danica KneÅ¾evic, Robyn Backen  \\n  \\nBottom row (Lâ€“R): Maria Cruz, Sylvia Griffin, Anne Zahalka, Noelene Lucas, Elwira Skowronska, Anne Ferran, Rosemary Laing, Nell, Janet Laurence, Eugenia Raskopoulos, Julie Rrap",

In making the work Barton first asked Beer to provide a list of two of her favourite fruit and vegetables from each season. The eight chosen ingredients become pictorial elements woven around her. They signify her passions and personality in the same way the lives of the saints are decipherable through a language of objects in the history of art. These include peas, asparagus, peaches, quince, pomegranate and tomatoes. Beer holds her favourite flower â€“ a yellow rose to her heart, a consciously romantic inclusion by the artist who described her impression that her sitter 'fills up a room with light and energy and generosity'. A pheasant looms large â€“ significant as Beer's first Barossa Valley restaurant was renowned for serving locally sourced pheasant and her famous pheasant farm pate.\\n\\nThe portrait began with a single photographic sitting from which emerged a potent, imaginative and richly embellished portrait, worlds away from the artist's Sydney studio.",

When approaching this commission, both artist and sitter â€“ world champion cyclist Anna Meares OAM (b. 1983) â€“ were relieved that neither wanted bicycles, Lycra or helmets to appear. As Meares put it 'the last thing I wanted was to have another picture to portray what I did as opposed to who I am'. Autio captured this image of Meares in low light at the end of a winter day they had spent working together at various locations around the Adelaide Hills â€“ a creative process Autio described as exploring 'the landscape as a stage'. The portrait makes a symbolic association between Meares, who stands relatively small and almost spectral in the image, with the traits she is known for as an athlete â€“ the strength and resilience of the tree which bends and prevails, and the enduring presence of the rock formation rising out of the landscape. \\n\\nMeares was the first, and youngest, Australian female track cyclist to win an Olympic gold medal in Athens in 2004. Four years later, just seven months after she broke her neck and dislocated her shoulder at a World Cup meet in Los Angeles, Meares took silver in the sprint at the Beijing Olympics. The first Australian athlete to win four medals in four consecutive Olympic Games, Meares collected 18 gold, 16 silver and 10 bronze medals at Olympic, World and Commonwealth Games levels.",

I come from the country, and so I asked Narelle to present me, I guess, in a slightly softer, more feminine way but allow the landscape that Iâ€™m sat in in this image to speak for the strength, the toughness, the resilience that Iâ€™ve shown in my career.\\n\\nWhen I met Narelle, I remember the first thing she said is â€˜So what do you think, what are your ideas?â€™ and I was so happy that she asked me first rather than giving me her ideas â€˜cos I was scared she was going to say how Iâ€™m going to put the bike here and weâ€™re going to put Lycra there. And then as I kind of explained to her how I felt about it and the ideas that I had, I could see, I think, she really resonated with it and she took it from there. So I kind of relied on Narelle around, you know, locations, given her experience of photography in South Australia and I said I was looking for something that could convey some contrast, I guess, between the softness of how I want to be presented to the harshities that the country and land can portray, and maybe the landscape could speak for some of the traits that Iâ€™m known for as an athlete but also the person, so â€¦ the tree as well, you know, itâ€™s struggling to grow and has grown for a very long time, and you can see the wear and the effect, of, you know, what itâ€™s gone through, the struggles, the challenges that itâ€™s faced, you know, you see the dead log in front of it where parts of it have broken off but itâ€™s continued to grow and I think that really symbolises the resilience and tough things that Iâ€™ve had to experience in my career as well.",

The couple sat for a portrait and when they returned to Australia, they digitally manipulated the image to make this double portrait. The mirrored image, which honours the fragility of the photographic object, poetically suggests an unstable balance between image and reality, inviting the idea of ghost or shadow selves into the frame. \\n\\nHossein and Angela met at the South Australian School of Art. For almost 50 years they shared a personal and creative life and often made work together. This double portrait reflects a number of their ongoing preoccupations â€“ states of being together and alone; Angela's interest in symmetry in nature; the duality of Hossein's Persian heritage and Australian identity; and the physical material quality of the work of art.",

'We talked about this idea of chaos and stillness and how she manages to stay quite centred within herself despite the crazy lifestyle â€¦ so with one of the layers of the images, she'd be quite still and looking directly at the camera and then with one of the other layers, she was doing more movement.' Mauboy enjoyed the collaborative nature of the sitting, as she recalled: 'just having a bit of a play, having a bit of movement, really creating those layers of personality â€¦ being strong, being loving to yourself and kind, but also being wild.'\\n\\nMauboy is a descendant of the KuKu Yalanji nation of Far North Queensland. In 2006, at the age of 16, she captured national attention as the runner-up on the television program Australian Idol. Since then, she has achieved music sales over 3.3 million units, five top 10 albums, 15 top 20 singles, four platinum selling albums and two ARIA Music Awards. She has also appeared in the films _Bran Nue Dae_ (2009) and _The Sapphires_ (2012). In 2015 she became an ambassador for the Indigenous Literacy Foundation, and in 2018 she was named an Australian tourism ambassador and represented Australia at the Eurovision Song Contest.",

It was just healing; music is a healing process for me. And Iâ€™m sure it kind of really takes people through their story, at times when theyâ€™re by themselves or when theyâ€™re with a ground of people or a crowd, you feel this permission to just, you know, have time to yourself and be you. I think thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so close with music, thatâ€™s why I have so much faith in it and I put everything into it, in the 15 years that Iâ€™ve been working my way of presenting music or performing or singing.\\n\\nIâ€™m always learning, I think Iâ€™m always kind of finding people that are inspiring me every day and Iâ€™m kind of taking a part of them, or a piece of them, or something that theyâ€™ve written or visually kind of, you know, shared, and just kind of reusing sometimes, or just kind of really taking that, putting it in some of my files and storing that and perhaps down the road, whether itâ€™s that colour or the sound that really will inspire me in making the music.\\n\\nMy kind of way of living is not trying to live in regrets. I think everything you do takes you a step further to being the best you can, being best at anything. You make a mistake, you gave it a go and you must try it again. And thereâ€™s always going to be a way out, itâ€™s just being patient with it.\\n\\nYou know, I think it is about being brave and trying to find whatever that confidence within you thatâ€™s so deep down there. Be kind to it and, you know, itâ€™ll come up every time you do it and you try and you get better at it. Be brave and always have that faith and belief in yourself, really.",

                    "transcript": "This is a black and white photographic portrait of Kuku Yalanji nation descendent, performer Jessica Mauboy created by David Rozetzky in 2018. \\n\\nIt is 106cm high and 150cm wide, encased a two and a half centimetre black frame.\\n\\nThe background is black and the portrait is glass-covered which creates a cool, reflective surface, the black has a matt quality, appearing soft and velvet-like.\\n\\nOccupying the centre of the picture, Jessica Mauboy is captured from the top of her head to upper thigh. She is standing turned to the right, her left shoulder to us. She wears an unusual shawl-like, cropped jacket that suggests movement, like she has just this moment stopped dancing and turned her direct gaze to the viewer. \\n\\nJessica is a startlingly attractive young woman; her long hair has blonde highlights and falls past her shoulders in a textured mane. Her centre-parted hair covers some of her high, wide forehead, fanning out onto her shoulders to frame her face. Her arresting, unflinching gaze leaps out of the portrait from dark, rounded eyes beneath thick, sculpted eyebrows. She has full, closed lips, flawless cheeks and a rounded chin.\\n\\nJessicaâ€™s long hair ends at her breast, she wears a low-cut black dress with a tight little frill along the v of her cleavage.\\n\\nHer deconstructed shrug sits across her upper arms and shoulders. Thick, woven, beaded strands form a riot of uneven, messy tangled lines, hanging off her left shoulder and down her arm, over the bunched sleeve of her dress that ends at her elbow. The shrug is structured around her neck, short and curved along the line of her breast. Collectively the beaded strands sparkle white against the blacks and greys of the rest of the layered photograph. \\n\\nThe photographer has chosen to add to the impression of recent movement in the picture as there is a figure beside her, separating from her torso, bursting out behind her. Also Jessica, with her body arched backwards, her long hair swaying down her back, nose to the sky with eyes closed as though dancing and absorbed in an internal world. Itâ€™s a blurry image, captured mid-motion. The beads on the second figureâ€™s shrug are just a blur, light, loose smudges of hair and tassels descending in different directions. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Meredith Hughes and voiced by Carol Wellman Kelly**",

After a cadetship on the Daily Mirror she began work at Pix magazine. She met Lewis Morley when she was working as chief sub-editor on POL, Dolly and Belle. She edited Belle from 1975 to 1979, when she began five years as editor of Vogue Living. After a move to the Sydney Morning Herald she returned to Vogue Living from 1989 to 1999.

During 1910, he held twelve Australian championship titles; and in the same year set world records for four events, earning himself the Helms Athletic Foundation of America Award for Athlete of the Year. In 1920 he founded the Advanx Tyre Repair Company; in 1933 the Olympic Tyre and Rubber Company; and in 1953 Olympic Consolidated Industries. He was Lord Mayor of Melbourne from 1940 to 1942, the year he was knighted. An active proponent of Learn to Swim classes, he gave Â£200,000 towards a sports centre at the University of Melbourne and contributed substantially to Melbourneâ€™s successful bid to host the 1956 Olympic Games. He died unexpectedly in May 1956, six months before the Games opened.",

In 1956 she set a womenâ€™s world record for the 200 metres at Moore Park, beating the record set by her compatriot Marjorie Jackson at the 1952 Helsinki Games. Cuthbert had tickets to the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games as a spectator, but she attended as a competitor, earning the nickname the â€˜Golden Girlâ€™ from the Melbourne Argus when she won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4 x 100m relay. The 1958 Commonwealth Games, the 1960 Olympics and the 1962 Commonwealth Games went badly for her, but at the Tokyo Olympics of 1964 she won the 400m, making her only the second woman to have won four different track races. In 1969 she developed multiple sclerosis, and was a vigorous fundraiser for research into the disease. In 1998, Cuthbert was named a Living National Treasure; the Athletic Stadium at Homebush is named in her honour. Ern McQuillan OAM (1926-2018), completed a photography cadetship at the Daily Mirror in the 1940s and after World War II worked for newspapers and magazines such as the Womenâ€™s Weekly, the Sunday Telegraph, the Daily Telegraph and the Bulletin. This photograph is one of several taken during a session at Cuthbertâ€™s family home in Ermington, also the location of a plant nursery run by her father. McQuillan recalled that Cuthbert was a â€˜most cooperativeâ€™ subject, who was happy to don her running gear for some action shots having already been photographed â€˜watering the plants and doing bits and piecesâ€™ for her father.",

Coached by Sam Herford, he won three gold medals at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics and a gold, a silver and a bronze in 1960. He won four gold at the 1962 Commonwealth Games, and broke the world record in the 880 yards that year. His vegetarian diet, which included seaweed, saw him dubbed â€˜the Seaweed Streakâ€™. After his retirement from swimming, Rose lived in the USA, where he worked with the Los Angeles Lakers from 1987 to 1994. Jon Henricks (b. 1935), freestyler, started his career as a distance swimmer, scoring his first good results in 1952. After coach Harry Gallagher converted him to sprints, he trained regularly against Dawn Fraser, and shocked everyone by breaking the Olympic record for 100m in the Australian Championships of 1953. He won gold at the 1956 Olympics in the 100m and 4 x 200m. John Devitt AM (1937-2023), freestyler and swimming administrator, is best known for his split-decision win over Lance Larson in the 100m freestyle at the 1960 Rome Olympics. He won two gold medals as popular captain of the Australian Olympic Team in both 1956 and 1960. \\n\\nErn McQuillan OAM (1926-2018), grew up in the inner western suburbs of Sydney and started taking photos after acquiring a box Brownie as a boy. In the early 1940s he worked as a copy boy for the Truth and Sportsman newspapers before being offered a cadetship with the Daily Mirror. After war service with the military history unit, he joined Australian Consolidated Press in 1948 and then went freelance a decade later, before returning to ACP as a photographer for the Australian Womenâ€™s Weekly and Bulletin. The son of boxing trainer Ern McQuillan senior and at one time a professional fighter, McQuillan gave up boxing when his news editor complained that he looked too beaten up to go out on assignment. McQuillan was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1998 for his services to news photography.",

Spotted by an Australian Institute of Sport diving coach, he began diving training while continuing his trampolining. He won a number of national junior diving titles between 2002 and 2004, won his first senior national title in 2005 and in 2006 represented Australia in three events at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. In 2008 he won the 1m, 3m and 10m individual events at the Australian National Championships and at the Diving Grand Prix in Florida. In Beijing he fared poorly in the 3m springboard event, and entered the final round of the 10m in second place, 34 points behind. With his final dive, however, Mitcham earned the then highest single-dive score in Olympic history and became the first Australian male to win an Olympic gold medal in diving since 1924. Mitcham was one of fewer than a dozen openly gay athletes in Beijing, out of a total of approximately 11,000 competitors. His 2012 autobiography _Twists and Turns_ described his many vicissitudes, including battles with depression and alcohol abuse, and the recreational drug use which almost derailed his athletic career. The book was subsequently adapted into a cabaret show, performed by Mitcham himself for Fringe World, Perth and the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardis Gras festival in 2015. He was a finalist on _Dancing with the Stars_ that year, and his second stage show, _Under the Covers_, premiered in 2017. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2020 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2022. \\n\\nRoss Watson's portrait of Mitcham is from _Classic de Novo_, a series of paintings in which sitters including dancer Marco Da Silva, Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears, retired High Court Judge Michael Kirby and AFL footballer Paul Licuria are inserted into paintings by artists such as Caravaggio, Vermeer and Jacob van Ruisdael. Mitcham appears in the series twice: in a reworking of Caravaggio's famous _Boy with a basket of fruit_; and in this variation on Sebastiano Ricci's _The fall of Phaeton_, in which Phaeton, son of the sun-God Helios, tumbles from his father's chariot. Watson's work is represented in the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and many private collections, notably that of Sir Elton John, whose early support encouraged the artist.",

Her career took a body blow in 2004, when the Australian Sports Drug Agency found her guilty of refusing to submit to a drugs test. Pileggi appealed against her omission, claiming the drug testers didn't follow protocols as they did not inform her she was required to take a test. She was however handed a two-year ban from the sport - a punishment that saw her removed from the Athens Olympics. Pileggi is currently considering whether she will resume training and return to her sport later this year.",

Andrew made his professional debut with the Tigers at age eighteen in 1983, and was selected to represent Australia at the Los Angeles Olympics the following year. A five-time Olympian, he captained the Boomers from 1994 through to the Sydney 2000 Games, where he was the nation's flag-bearer. Gaze was the National Basketball League's leading scorer, for a remarkable sixteen seasons, from 1986 to 2001; holds the NBL record for the average points per game in a season (44.1); was selected in the All-NBL First Team every year from 1986 to 2000; and was named the NBL's most valuable player seven times. As well as playing American college basketball, he played in the Italian and Greek leagues, and in the NBA, where he played with the Washington Bullets in 1994 and the San Antonio Spurs in 1999 (the year the Spurs won their first NBA championship). In 1991, Gaze was named amongst the 50 greatest players by FIBA (the International Basketball Federation). Retiring from international basketball in 2000, he kept playing for the Melbourne Tigers until 2005. He was appointed coach of the Sydney Kings in 2016. Gaze was inducted into the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame in 2004 and the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2014, he was Australian Father of the Year.",

Having qualified for the Beijing Paralympic Games in 2008, she had few expectations other than to 'have a little bit of fun', but instead won three medals. At the Paralympics in London in 2012, she won four gold and two bronze medals. In 2016 â€“ having recovered from two shoulder reconstructions and having won three world titles â€“ she won six medals at the Paralympics in Rio. Her two Paralympic medals in Tokyo in 2021 bring her tally to seventeen.\\n\\nWylie's Baths in Coogee is the dramatic backdrop for Peter Brew-Bevan's 2016 portrait of Cole.

For me, swimming was particularly special because it was the only sport that I could participate in as a kid where I could take my prosthetic leg off, jump in the water and I could be the same as all the other kids. I think that when youâ€™re young, you just want to be accepted by all of your friends and a way for me to do that was swimming. Then I found after a while that I could actually be better than most of my friends at that sport and it gave me a really great platform to show all of my friends at school that I could still achieve things in a physical sense. Because I definitely wasnâ€™t running up and down beside them in the playground, but get me into a pool and Iâ€™ll beat you. That was always kind of the mentality that I had when I was younger. And so for me, like, the pool was definitely a great place of freedom. But it was where I learned how to back myself, how to be resilient, how to show the world what I could do. And then I found my way onto the Paralympic team with that exact same attitude and have since seen how the Paralympics can show the world what their athletes can do.\\n\\nSo I did that photoshoot with Peter right before the Rio Paralympic Games. And it was a moment where we really wanted to showcase the athletes of Australia that were going to the Olympics and the Paralympics. And so I was asked to do a photo shoot outside, which was really exciting for me to begin with. And then Peter put me on some really beautiful rocks with the Australian flag and I guess he kind of wanted to show what I wanted to do when I was younger, which was a mermaid, like, I always dreamed of being a mermaid when I was younger. And so to be able to capture that in a portrait, as well as you know, the strength and, you know, showcasing my disability as well and combining that into, like, my childhood dream with the inclusion of being strong and powerful, was a really great photo for me. And, you know, it's something that I've always looked back on, being really proud to have been involved in such a creation, but I always look at it and think that's not me, but it is. It's just beautiful.",

                    "transcript": "Ellie Cole, by Peter Brew-Bevan, 2016, printed 2021. This work is a photographic portrait of Ellie Cole OAM, Australiaâ€™s most decorated Paralympian swimmer. The printed work measures 150 cm wide and 108 cm tall and is presented with a white border in a simple black wooden frame. Cole is pictured beside the ocean seated atop an Australian flag draped over a large dark boulder which sits atop a mass of other cliffside rocks. It is dusk, with wispy peach-tinted clouds blending into the pale blue sky behind her. The photograph has been colour-graded warmly and with a dramatic dark cast so the dark blue of the Australian flag appears almost black.\\n\\nCole is positioned on the left half of the frame facing the camera. Her left leg is tucked up close to her body, her knee near her shoulder, with her left arm extended behind it, her hand resting on her foot. Her right leg, a prosthetic leg made from charcoal coloured carbon fibre and silver steel, is outstretched beneath her, its shiny surface reflecting the light. Her artificial foot, made from a pale skin-like material with some scuffing around the toes, rests on another lower rock. Her right arm is extended to her right, supporting her on the rock, her hand open on the flag beneath her. The 7-pointed Federation Star is visible below her prosthetic leg.\\n\\nShe looks to camera with a neutral expression, her head slightly tilted to her left. Her eyes squint slightly into the dying sunlight and her lips are parted and raised in the beginnings of a smile revealing her white teeth. Her brown hair is wet and she is wearing a black one- piece Speedo swimsuit. The soft sunset light illuminates her smooth skin, highlighting her muscular build.\\n\\nTo the left of Cole is the ocean, deep blue-black with mild choppy waves. A boat sits on the far horizon barely visible in the distance. The boulders she is sitting on continue across the width of the photograph, dominating the frame. The rocks are smoothed with age, some dotted with white lichen and small crustacea. At the top-right of the frame a wooden and metal frame structure ascends from the rocks and extends out of the frame.\\n\\nAudio description written and voiced by Kate Matthews",

At her first Olympics, in Beijing in 2008, Cate won bronze medals in the 50m freestyle and as part of the 4 x 100m freestyle relay team. She was a member of the team that won gold in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay at the London Olympics in 2012, and in 2013 she claimed the individual 100m freestyle world title. Bronte â€“ who won a world junior championship in 2011 â€“ made her Olympic debut in London, and with Cate was part of the team that won silver in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay at the 2013 world championships. Bronte won three individual titles at the world championships in 2015 â€“ becoming only the third woman in history to win both the 50m and 100m titles â€“ and won gold alongside Cate, Emma McKeon and Emily Seebohm in the 4 x 100 freestyle relay. The duo helped Australia win gold in the same event at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, with Cate swimming a blistering final leg to set a new world record. In qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics, Cate became only the third Australian swimmer to have qualified for four successive Olympic Games, and with basketballer Patrick Mills was named as flagbearer for the opening ceremony. Cate, Bronte, McKeown and Meg Harris formed the 4 x 100m freestyle team that in Tokyo won Australia its third consecutive Olympic gold in the event, with Cate also anchoring Australia's gold-medal winning 4 x 100m medley relay team. The Campbell sisters currently have 62 Olympic, World, Commonwealth and Pan Pacific medals between them; and both have been awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia â€“ Cate in 2014 and Bronte in 2017 â€“ for their contribution to swimming. In 2021 they published _Sister Secrets: life lessons from the pool to the podium,_ an inspirational book for children and young adults which is nevertheless upfront in its discussion of body shaming and the treatment of female swimmers.",

Aged sixteen, she was selected for the Australian womenâ€™s 4 x 100m relay team that took out the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, making her the first Aboriginal athlete to win a Commonwealth gold medal. She won two more gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in Canada in 1994. The first Aboriginal track and field athlete to represent Australia at the Olympic Games, she won a silver medal in Atlanta in 1996. She was ranked first in the world in her signature event, the 400m, in which she won back-to-back World Championships in 1997 and 1999, and, memorably, the Olympic gold medal in front of her home crowd in Sydney in 2000. The Catherine (now Cathy) Freeman Foundation was established in 2007 to enhance educational opportunities for Aboriginal children.\\n\\nThis photograph was taken at the NSW Academy of Sport in December 1994. As Denis Montalbetti and Gay Campbell noted: 'It's irrelevant how many times a person has been photographed. Our aim is to create unique images of them, to be part of their testimony â€¦ a part of their photographic history.'",

Coloured in tones ranging from sepia to velvety black, her face is closely cropped to exclude her hair and much of her forehead.\\n\\nHer strong, black, gently arched brows span the width of the image and a water droplet rests in the slight crease between them. Deeply set almond shaped eyes gaze directly forward with intense focus that commands attention. There are dark shadows in the inner corners of her eyes that extend underneath them and a short way down her nose. Cathyâ€™s nose is narrow at the bridge but broadens towards the tip and another water droplet pools at the side of her left nostril.  \\nLight shines on her left cheek making it lighter than her right. Her cheeks are slightly lifted. On the right side, the area between her nose and upper lip is in shadow.  \\nHer full lips are framed by subtle creases on either side. She holds her mouth closed, a droplet gleams and drips from under her rounded chin, suspended in an extended tear shape. Behind it, a narrow band of her neck is visible, the rest disappearing into deep black. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Krysia Kitch and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

In 1999 he set world records for the 400 and 200 metres freestyle. He broke his own records for both events again in qualifying for the Sydney Olympics, in which he won three gold and two silver medals and set a further three world records. His haul for 2001 and 2002 included six world championship titles and six gold medals at the Manchester Commonwealth Games. In claiming the 400 metres freestyle world title in 2003, Thorpe became the first swimmer to win the same event at three consecutive world championships. At the 2004 Athens Olympics he won gold in the 400 metres and 200 metres freestyle. World Swimmer of the Year for 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2002, Thorpeâ€™s subsequent honours include two honorary doctorates and the Human Rights Medal, acknowledging his advocacy in Indigenous education, LGBTQI+ rights and mental health.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nPerth-based photographer Brett CanÃ©t-Gibson has produced photo and written essays for national and international publications and has been a National Photographic Portrait Prize finalist multiple times.

Fearnley was born with a condition that had prevented the development of his spine, yet growing up in Carcoar, New South Wales, he enthusiastically participated in football and other sports alongside his brothers and schoolmates. He took up wheelchair racing at fourteen and was nineteen when he won silver medals in the 800 metres and the 4 x 100 metres relay at the Paralympic Games in Sydney. At the 2004 Athens Paralympics he won gold in the 5000 metres and the marathon, the final five kilometres of which he wheeled with a flat tyre. Between 2004 and 2014 he amassed four World Championship gold medals, one Commonwealth Games gold medal, and another Paralympic gold; plus three victories in the Chicago marathon, one in the London marathon and five in the New York marathon. In 2011 he crawled the Kokoda Track to raise money for mental health charities and was part of the crew that took line honours in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race. Fearnley captained the Australian team at the 2016 Paralympics in Rio and won his second Commonwealth marathon gold at the Gold Coast Games in 2018. An inspirational spokesperson on disability issues, Fearnley was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2018 and was the 2019 New South Wales Australian of the Year.",

Before turning to road racing in 2001, heâ€™d represented Australia at the Atlanta and Sydney Olympics and won the mountain bike world cups of 1998 and 1999. A climber and time trial specialist known for his outstanding endurance and mental toughness, Evans finished inside the top ten in his first two Tour de France appearances. On his third, he became the first Australian to achieve a place on the podium, finishing second, and he was runner-up again in 2008. A week after finishing third in the 2009 Vuelta a EspaÃ±a he became the menâ€™s road racing world champion, following this up with wins in the Belgian road race La FlÃ¨che Wallone in 2010, and the Tirrenoâ€“Adriatico (in 2011). A favourite for the 2011 Tour de France, Evans secured the yellow jersey in the penultimate stage and on 24 July 2011 became the first Australian to win the epic race. He featured in its top ten again in 2012 and finished third in the gruelling 2013 edition of the Giro dâ€™Italia. A veteran of eight world championship road campaigns and member of the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Teams, Evans was Australian Male Road Cyclist of the Year six years running from 2006, and Australian Cyclist of the Year for 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2011. In late 2014, he unveiled plans for the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race, announcing on the same occasion that the inaugural instalment of the event in 2015 would be his last as a professional cyclist. \\n\\nMatthÃ¿s Gerber (b. 1956) was born in the Netherlands and has lived in Australia since 1972.

Everyone told me you canâ€™t believe how fast it is and how many people there are and not only is it the most competitive with the deepest quality field, the most competitive field to race in, therefore the hardest to win at, it also goes far beyond the sport in terms of the public, the spectators, the number of spectators, but also the type of spectators. Youâ€™re still in a bike race and youâ€™re racing along roads but all of a sudden youâ€™re racing in a crowd of maybe a soccer stadium. And yeah, thatâ€™s sort of one race where youâ€™ll probably get beers spilt on you once while youâ€™re racing a bike. There might be 100, 200, 300 thousand people standing on the side of the road, and they all want to see one rider and if youâ€™re in the yellow jersey thatâ€™s really quite unlike anything else Iâ€™ve experienced in life. I wouldnâ€™t say itâ€™s healthy, three weeks is a long time to be in the limelight like that.\\n\\nObviously my 2011 Tour de France victory is what sort of shaped me as a bike rider and, I suppose, as an Australian sports person. Iâ€™m proud of how I got there and how I worked and the difficulties that I overcame to get there. Two years previously I became world champion on the road, I won the 2009 World Championship road cycling world championships and that was in a moment of difficulty. A lot of people in the world of cycling didnâ€™t believe in me. But I believed in myself, and I had a few key people around me believe in me and together we overcame what seemed like very difficult odds to do something that was at that moment in my sport in some ways historic.\\n\\nMy biggest thing that motivated me through my career was that one day, my opportunityâ€™s going to end and when that day comes I donâ€™t want to have any regrets that I didnâ€™tâ€™ work hard enough, that I didnâ€™t try hard enough, didnâ€™t make enough sacrifices or I wasnâ€™t dedicated enough. And when that day did come, I crossed the finish line of my last race and I left the world of competitive cycling at the top level in complete peace, with some pride and a great deal of satisfaction of what I had the opportunity to achieve and with those opportunities, what I achieved.",

Born in Adelaide, Oâ€™Grady started out as a track cyclist and was eighteen when he won silver in the team pursuit at the Barcelona Olympics. Part of the squad that triumphed in the same event in the 1993 and 1995 world championships, he scored two bronze medals in Atlanta in 1996 and became an Olympic gold medalist in Athens in 2004 as one half of the combination that won the madison. By this time, Oâ€™Grady had also branched into road racing, competing in his first Tour de France in 1998 and wearing the yellow jersey for three stages. Among his numerous other achievements, in 2007, he became the first Australian to win a European one day classic when he took out the race nicknamed â€˜The Hell of the Northâ€™, the 260-kilometre Paris to Roubaix. He retired from professional cycling within days of completing his seventeenth Tour de France, this record-equalling achievement tarnished by his admission of having once participated in the doping practices revealed to have been prevalent in the sport during the 1990s. \\n\\nMatthÃ¿s Gerber (b. 1956) was born in the Netherlands and has lived in Australia since 1972. Drawing on the modes of representation used throughout the history of European painting, he has produced a diverse body of work ranging from representational landscapes to abstraction.

Given I love relationship narratives, I happily invited Amrita to join us. We played with different scenarios; they are both incredibly creative, dynamic, reflective and engaging. They were very comfortable together and with themselves. I wanted to capture that energy and spontaneity and the freshness of spirit I saw, and for the painting to reflect the colourful life they would have and are having together.â€™  \\n\\n\\nNaarm/Melbourne-based artist Dagmar Cyrulla constructs contemporary narratives in her paintings and sculptures, encouraging contemplation and discussion of what it is to be human in this ever-changing and socially challenging world.",

The boxing ring, dreaming scapes and endangered birds, among other anecdotal and worldly subjects, find a way into Richardâ€™s artworks. I like the way he probes his psyche, making paintings, drawings and animations which are humble, whimsical and incisive. His works resonate with his everyday stories, but also reflect everyoneâ€™s stories. I wanted to make a picture with moments of Richard in the studio â€“ in the format of an assemblage of working drawings â€“ alternative views that reflect the diversity of Richardâ€™s work and interests.â€™ \\n\\nMartin King is a Naarm/Melbourne-based artist whose practice includes drawing, watercolour, printmaking, artist books and animation.

This artwork acknowledges the self portraits so many of us paint, day in and day out, only for them to wash down the sink. In capturing traces of these acts, I recall the gentle repose of a Victorian death mask. The face is the ultimate canvas on which our innermost desires, identities, neuroses and vanities can be variously portrayed, and betrayed. This piece was created in the early hours of  \\nNew Yearâ€™s Day 2024, perfectly bottling feelings of longing, anticipation, disappointment, insecurity and hope.â€™\\n\\nBased on Whadjuk Noongar Country in Boorloo/Perth and Gadigal Land in Sydney, Nena Salobir is a conceptual artist specialising in portraiture. Her long-running project _Self portrait in society_ is a cumulative artwork consisting of portraits she draws while her subjects draw her at the same time.",

Through a chance encounter, he reinvented himself as an entertainer in a travelling show. Now 57, he has beaten the odds. While most people with his condition die by 40, he has found love, success and bought a house â€“ a testament to human resilience and positivity.",

On the 50th anniversary of the SDC in 2019, Murphy recollected that dancer and co-artistic director of the SDC Janet Vernon would hang Frederiksonâ€™s costume illustrations on her dressing room mirror. â€˜They were so exquisitely drawn that when she was doing her make-up and psyching up for the show, they would take her straight into the world she needed to inhabit. Itâ€™s wonderful when a costume is not something you throw on but a doorway to the character you become on stage.â€™\\n\\nPeter Brew-Bevanâ€™s portrait shows the designer at home, surrounded by shelves overflowing with books and CDs. Notoriously private, Fredrikson looks at the camera with one hand covering half his face.",

Over the years he has created productions for companies including Opera Australia, Shanghai Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. \\n\\nLewis Morley took this photograph during Murphyâ€™s first year as artistic director of The Dance Company (as the SDC was then known). Over four decades with the company, Murphy created a repertoire of more than 50 works. He explained his creative process during a 2020 conversation with David McAllister: â€˜It comes out of the deepest recesses of my subconscious, my movement, and if it doesnâ€™t relate, then I donâ€™t have a continuity within.â€™",

Interviewed for _RealTime_ in 2017, Pippa described the role of dance in her work: â€˜dance allows me to capture things that are outside of myself and itâ€™s purely visual. Dance provided me a visual language for all those complex, inner emotional states of being human. It enabled me to express things that words canâ€™t and allows a level of empathy thatâ€™s otherwise difficult to find.â€™",

They own the movement really because no one else has done this. Itâ€™s just them and their body.

In an article by Steven Dow for _The Guardian_ in 2021, Rings said of Lawford-Wolf, â€˜She was so proud of her country; she loved her country â€¦ She was naturally gifted. I wish I could have made the shapes she made. She had long legs, she was statuesque, and she looked beautiful.â€™",

And I wanted to write a theatre that was different, had all different forms of acting in it whether it be music, dance, singing, a monologue. And I wanted to stay in the traditional way of storytelling but make it real, make it different. And the only way, and the only way I can do stories like that was to fall back on myself and my plays, like â€˜You know, youâ€™ve got a story yourself, youâ€™ve been to Alaska when you were 16, you know, you lived here, you lived there, youâ€™ve come from Christmas Creek station, youâ€™ve come up from nowhere and make a name for yourself in the acting world and that is an achievement for someone my age. And I never really thought about it because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m anything special. I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m still quite naive in that aspect.\\n\\nI wanted to make it honest too, â€˜cos you look at a lot of Aboriginal people that are working out there, thereâ€™s a lot of Aboriginal women that are working but not really strong Aboriginal womenâ€™s stories. And I wanted to make my point of view as a woman and as a proud Aboriginal woman, proud of where I come from, whether than be the backblocks of Woop Woop but yet that place still has a very big significance for me. I wanted to make Australia realise that they do have an Indigenous culture in Australia. They have it here. No, no, and Australia doesnâ€™t need to go anywhere else and adopt someone elseâ€™s Indigenous culture which a lot of people tend to do. But, you know, they have it here. And nobody hasnâ€™t discovered it, itâ€™s so funny going to Europe, for me, and more European people know more about Aboriginal Australia than Australians do so which is quite sad, which is really really quite sad. It goes to show how ignorant white Australia is.",

During that tour she was elated when ballet critic Arnold Haskell, writing for Melbourneâ€™s _Table Talk_, described her performance as â€˜brilliantâ€™, noting her â€˜aristocratically energetic movementâ€™. Tchinarova remained in Sydney after a second tour with Covent Garden Russian Ballet in 1938.

As Kitcher reflected in his 2001 book _From Gaolbird to Lyrebird_: â€˜An infusion of excitement, apprehension and nerves spread through the new company as we awaited the arrival of Robert Helpmann â€¦ His formidable authority and flamboyant personality were legendary.â€™  \\n\\n\\nThis photographic montage resulted from David Mooreâ€™s short sitting with Helpmann in his Sydney hotel room in 1969.

Markova then decided to leave and start her own company with Anton Dolin. And I thought, â€˜Well this is the end of the balletâ€™, when Ninette de Valois said, â€˜Iâ€™ve found a girl that youâ€™re going to dance withâ€™, and took me into the classroom and I said, â€˜Which one?â€™ She said, â€˜That one over there with the two long plaitsâ€™, and I thought, â€˜That funny-looking little girl?â€™ and I said, â€˜Whatâ€™s her name?â€™ and she said, â€˜Peggy Hookhamâ€™, and I said, â€˜Well, thatâ€™s not going to look very good on the notice board is it, Peggy Hookham?â€™ And I said, â€˜She looks Chineseâ€™. And she said, â€˜Well as a matter of fact, she was born in Shanghai but she is English. No, she was born in Reigate and she went to Shanghai as a little girl â€“ I want you to work with herâ€™. And the minute, of course, I saw her dance, I realised that she was absolutely wonderful, and Ninette said, â€˜Sheâ€™s going to change her name, sheâ€™s going to call herself Margot Fonteynâ€™. And so from that moment on, I danced with Fonteyn for 27 years and I suppose we became, at that time, the most famous pair dancing in Europe.\\n\\nIâ€™m always asked what was the most memorable performance or production, and itâ€™s impossible really for me to say, because so many things have been memorable to me. My first appearances with Markova, my first appearances with Fonteyn, my first appearances with Vivienne Leigh, the first time I played _Hamlet_, all of them. I have never felt for one minute in my life, â€˜Iâ€™m a successâ€™. I feel Iâ€™ve accomplished something and that is done and therefore there is something more to do. The success or failure of what has passed has passed and I must go on to something else. And whatever else I may have achieved in life, I hope that people will remember that my whole life has been dedicated to producing something of beauty in the theatre.",

It is the storehouse of our knowledge, and the way we pay respect to our heritage. If knowledge is not passed on, the balance of our world becomes unhinged.

After university, where they both studied photography â€“ Will at Edith Cowan University and Garrett at the Queensland College of Art â€“ the artists gravitated to Melbourne where they met in 2006. The pair soon began to collaborate as The Huxleys, combining their separate practices of photography, filmmaking and costume design, with performance as a key element. Inspired by the attention-grabbing and the outrageous, the artists embrace the glamourous, the absurd and the provocative and in doing so challenge convention; the Huxleys persuade their audience to consider notions of gender, social mores and non-conformity. The artists have become part of a contemporary cohort of collaborating duos, which includes the British pair Gilbert and George, and Australia's Charles Green and Lyndal Brown. The Huxleys continue to be in demand across the country and internationally, invited to work at the Art Gallery of South Australia, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Museum of Brisbane, National Gallery of Victoria, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Heide Museum of Modern Art, Arts Centre Melbourne, Australian Centre for the Moving Image, the Mona Foma festival in Tasmania and Sydney Contemporary. They were the inaugural 'Disrupters in Residence' at HOTA on the Gold Coast, and were included in a select group of Australian artists invited to participate in the City of Melbourne's UPTOWN. Internationally they have performed and exhibited in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Moscow and Berlin."

                    "content": "James Angus, born in Perth, Western Australia, has consistently explored the complexities inherent in traditions of Western sculpture. The first museum exhibition of Angus's work at Sydney's Museum of Contemporary Art in 1992 surprised viewers with its resolute and conceptually rigorous interrogation of spatial dynamics, and its engagement with the processes of industrial production. In the late 1990s Angus produced a number of sculptural works that represented carefully chosen animals and objects. A life-sized yellow fibreglass rhinoceros, pink rubber giraffe, and painted bronze dodos evoked perceptual complexity and analysed assumptions of scale and form. The very specific nature of the subjects of Angus's sculptures reflected their rich cultural and semiotic capacities. In 1999 he made several sculptures of a basketball and soccer ball where the use of computer-assisted design techniques enabled the artist to apply physical forces theoretically in virtual space. A real basketball was scanned in 3D and reproduced inside the computer; a soccer ball was created mathematically using computer design. These simulations were then subjected to theoretical velocity and force, captured at the moment of impact with the earth after being dropped from the cruising altitude of a 747 jet airliner, and reproduced as sculptures cast in plaster and bronze."

Graduating in 1990, she worked for the Adelaide _Advertiser_ and for UK newspapers before returning to Australia in 1998, where she worked for the _Sydney Morning Herald_ until 2003. She is the first Australian to have won the venerable international Leica Oskar Barnack Award for photography. She has won two World Press awards, an American Picture of the Year award and two Walkley awards, as well as twice being a finalist in the Basil Sellers Art Prize. She also has won the Fleurieu Art Prize, the Bowness Photography Prize and the Olive Cotton Award. Now Adelaide-based, Autio creates poetic images that challenge the limits of photo- documentation, her subjects often â€˜unknownâ€™ people depicted in extraordinary surrounds. She is particularly renowned for lush, glowing photographs of figures in water. She frequently collaborates with her life partner, photographer Trent Parke. Her photographs are in major public collections across Australia and in many private and corporate collections."

It canâ€™t be recreated.\\n\\nSo yeah, it was great. We had this beautiful, you know, balmy day, really, in the middle of winter, or the end of winter, and this beautiful location which was a bit difficult to find, you know, like itâ€™s a strange sort of place on the other side of the hills in Adelaide, leading to Murray Bridge, and itâ€™s quite barren I guess, rolling hills, when all of a sudden this crop of rock sort of just breaks out of the ground, really. And we were lucky enough to find Mick who let us onto his property, and yeah, so I guess it all came together in the end.\\n\\nI guess for the last half hour, it was really fun, because we were actually just chasing the light around, you know, â€˜cos we were behind a little bit of an edge of hills and so we were losing the light and we just basically started down below and then walked up the hill and then found this she-oak and, you know, had ten minutes there and that was our picture.\\n\\nI guess I like using the landscape like a stage, you know, you find something special and then you wait for the light. I love using natural light, I love seeing what the sun can do and how it can illuminate things that you may not necessarily see â€“ it actually points you into a direction to look at, you know, and thatâ€™s, in the end, you standing there and having the light shine on you and you are in this beautiful white dress which kind of has a lovely soft glow on it. It brings a little bit of magic to it, you know, I guess with the magic hour we shot it in. But all the parts of that picture tell a story.",

She is one of Australia's most celebrated contemporary artists, famous for her figurative paintings that feature fantastical characters posed against ornateâ€”and sometimes psychedelicâ€”backgrounds. Many of Barton's intricate paintings are focused on women, often surrounded by an abundance of flowers, fruit and other symbols of femininity, fertility and motherhood. On the occasion of the opening of a major retrospective of her work at the National Gallery of Victoria in 2018, Barton said: 'My greater oeuvre always speaks to different ways of inhabiting a female body in all of its complexities.'\\n\\nBarton has been a finalist in the Archibald Prize five times and won it twice: first in 2008 for a self-portrait with her children, then in 2013 for her painting of the actor Hugo Weaving, which is one of her few male portraits. Although Barton is best known for her paintings, she also works with collage, sculpture, textiles and video. In 2022, Barton released her first feature film, _Blaze_, which she co-wrote and directed."

                    "content": "Sir Francis Beaurepaire (1891-1956), Olympic swimmer, businessman and civic leader, won his first Victorian swimming titles in 1906, following up with three national titles in 1908. Having gone to England to compete for Australia at the London Olympics in 1908, he trained in appalling conditions, without official support, to win the English half-mile and mile championships before competing with influenza to win Olympic silver in the 400 m and bronze in the 1500m. By 1910, his great year, he had twelve Australian championships to his credit. On a European tour he set world records for 300 yards and 200m, 300m and 500m, and won seven English titles, six in record time. For these and other feats he received the Helms Athletic Foundation of America award for Athlete of the Year. Having served in World War 1, he was invalided out in 1918 with trench fever. For a time he was barred from amateur swimming competition on the basis that he was a professional swimming instructor; however, he returned to competition in the Antwerp Olympics of 1920 to win another silver and bronze. In 1921 he won a further five Australian titles. His last Olympic swims were in Paris in 1924; he won a silver and bronze again. Thus, though he held fifteen world records, he never won a gold medal. In 1920 he founded the Advanx Tyre Repair Company in Sydney; in 1933 the Olympic Tyre and Rubber Company; and in 1953 Olympic Consolidated Industries. He was Lord Mayor of Melbourne from 1940 to 1942, the year he was knighted. The following year he stood unsuccessfully as a United Australia Party Senate candidate. An active proponent of Learn to Swim classes, he gave Â£200 000 for the establishment of a sports centre at the University of Melbourne and was one of the chief sponsors of the proposal to hold the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne."

She grew up in the Western suburbs of Sydney, where her parents instilled in her a passion for food. In 1970, she married Colin Beer and, three years later, the couple moved to the Barossa Valley in South Australia, which remains their home today. There, they started a farm and, in 1979, opened the Pheasant Farm Restaurant, offering simple meals made from scratch using only seasonal ingredients they grew themselves. This back-to-basics philosophy earned the restaurant a devoted following and critical acclaimâ€”it won the Remy Martin Cognac/Australian Gourmet Traveller Restaurant of the Year Award in 1991â€”while quietly revolutionising the Australian food industry, encouraging a greater focus on local produce and rustic, regional cuisine.\\n\\nAfter Beer closed Pheasant Farm Restaurant in 1993, she launched her own brand, Maggie Beer, which produces pÃ¢tÃ©, jams, wines, vinegars, verjuice and dozens of other products that are sold in Australia and around the world. Beer has also written several cookbooks and become a television presenter, appearing on programmes such as _The Cook and the Chef_, _The Great Australian Bake Off_ and _MasterChef Australia_. In 2010, she received the Senior Australian of the Year award for her work educating Australians about what they eat. Four years later, she created the Maggie Beer Foundation to enrich the lives of older Australians, especially those in aged care homes, through food."

Majoring in photography and printmaking, since graduating he has continued to make works on paper, holding regular solo exhibitions, including at the John Miller Galleries, Newcastle, at Grafton Regional Gallery and Lake Macquarie City Gallery, and participating in many in group exhibitions. As a photographer he has been a finalist in the Olive Cotton Prize (four times), the National Photographic Portrait Prize of 2014 and the Muswellbrook Photographic Prize, in which, in 2003, he took out both first and second prize. In the field of drawing, he has been a finalist in the Adelaide Perry Drawing Prize and won the Reg Russom Life Drawing Prize in 1994. Of his portraits, Beletich says, 'As a photographic artist, the main thread of my interest has always been portraiture. The challenge to convey a person, simply and honestly, is a pursuit that keeps me returning to this tradition.'"

Dr Robert Black met Nora Heysen while she was a war artist in New Guinea. They finally married in 1953 after which she often travelled with her husband to tropical regions where she painted the local people. Black's major contributions were in the prevention and control of malaria in the armed forces, in Australia and in developing countries, working in conjunction with the World Health Organisation (WHO). He eradicated malaria from the Northern Territory, Cape York and the Torres Strait Islands in 1962 - the area was officially declared to be malaria free by WHO in 1981. Black became a consultant for WHO and devoted the rest of his working life to preventing and eradicating malaria. He is the only Australian to have been awarded the Darling Foundation Medal and Prize by WHO for his work in the control of malaria."

After war service he resumed his studies, and in 1949 secured a job in the NGVâ€™s Print Room, where he worked until 1951, leaving to take up the position of art master at Melbourne Grammar School. His paintings succeeded immediately; his first exhibited work, _Barberâ€™s Shop_, was purchased for the NGV in 1953 as was _Collins Street, 5p.m._ three years later. In 1962 he became Head of the National Gallery Art School. Six years later, finally confident that he could make a living as a full-time artist, he resigned. He painted shopfronts, school yards, gardens and housing estates, nudes, office workers, ballroom dancers, jockeys, brides, drinkers, commissioned portraits and portraits of friends and family. In recent years _The Bar_ 1954 and _The Old Time_ 1969 have set new auction records for the sale of Australian paintings."

What Iâ€™m interested in in painting is people, of course, principally, how they live, how they behave, how they get the faces they deserve, how they can bear to put up with a life which seems so curiously tragic.\\n\\nOf course I know that to be interested in peopleâ€™s behaviour for a painter is most impure. Itâ€™s called literary, and in our day nothing could be a greater sin than to be a literary painter; but now Iâ€™m old enough to feel that itâ€™s a waste of time to apologise for not painting in some other way, and the fact is that Iâ€™m still always fascinated by people and their behaviour. And yet at the same time, itâ€™s not enough to just paint pictures of ideas; at the same time we must put it into a visual form which is as complete as any abstract visual form. And here, thereâ€™s always a conflict between the demands of the idea and the demands of the form.\\n\\nAnd in any case, Iâ€™m always dubious about the remarks painters make about their own work, because what we so often say is rather what we would like to have done than what weâ€™ve really done.",

                    "content": "Christopher Brennan (1870â€“1932), poet, was born to Irish parents in Sydney. A brilliant schoolboy, destined early for the priesthood, he gained a scholarship from Cardinal Moran and went to Riverview; there, he abandoned his vocation. As a language and classics student at Sydney University he edited Hermes, fell in love with Victorian poetry, graduated with a First and a University Medal, and lost his religious faith. After a short stint teaching at St Patrickâ€™s, Goulburn, he won a travelling scholarship to the University of Berlin, where he became convinced of the power of poetry to reclaim an ideal version of humanity. Returning to Sydney in 1894, he began cataloguing in the New South Wales Public Library, where he was to rise to second assistant librarian by 1907. Late in 1909 he was appointed an assistant lecturer in French and German at the University of Sydney. His poetic output â€“ complex and symbolic, always more European than Australian in sensibility - for the most part declined after 1902; his biographer Axel Clark suggests that the moderately successful pro-war poems he wrote during the First World War sprang from his hostility toward his German wife and mother-in-law. After he divorced, he embarked on an affair with a younger woman; her accidental death gave rise to some of his finest poems, but his life was thrown into irrecoverable chaos. Gaining odds and ends of teaching, and supported by friends and admirers, he retrieved his Catholic faith before he died. Clark writes that â€˜although he abhorred Henry Lawson as a poet and a man, the progress of their lives was hauntingly similar: promise, achievement, degeneration, disgrace, posthumous legend.â€™"

Born in Adelaide, he studied painting and drawing at the South Australian School of Art and Design and started taking photographs while completing his degree. He then moved to Sydney and from the mid-1990s began increasingly to specialise in portraiture. With clients including film studios and record companies, his carefully composed and thought-provoking photographs have appeared in a range of Australian and international publications including _Vogue_, _Marie Claire_, _Elle_, _Who_, _Rolling Stone_, _Inside Sport_ and _GQ_. In 2005, the National Portrait Gallery presented the exhibition _Peter Brew-Bevan: Portraits_ and he was one of eight photographers included in the Portrait Galleryâ€™s 2014 exhibition _Promo: Portraits from Prime Time_. His photographic book _Shoot: Studio Sessions_ (2007), a selection of his images of actors and other celebrities, won six industry awards for concept and design. In 2019, Brew-Bevan founded the 2020 MEN-Tality Project in partnership with Beyond Blue, which focuses on destigmatising men's mental health through a series of portraits of prominent Australian men with experience of depression and anxiety. The Portrait Gallery's collection includes 21 of his photographs."

As a student under Bernard Hall and WB McInnes at the NGV school from 1918 to 1924, he won many prizes. From this period on, his landscapes and flower pieces sold well, particularly in Victoria and South Australia, and from the time of his first Sydney exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries in 1927 he was commissioned as a portraitist. With a remarkable 72 portraits hung in the Archibald Prize between 1924 and 1966, he won the Prize in 1932 with a portrait of Sir William Irvine. At the end of the second world war he was sent as an official war artist to document the Japanese surrender; he missed the ceremony, but still completed 51 works for the War Memorial. Over the course of his career he made many articulate attacks on modern art."

Itâ€™s whatâ€™s known as direct painting. I think one of my exhibition managers said: â€˜Youâ€™re a first-class direct painter, Buckmasterâ€™. And I hardly knew what he meant in those days, but I can see it clearly now. Thereâ€™s the subject, you put up your canvas, you assess the picture, nature provides you with the inspiration, you, in your mindâ€™s eye, you eliminate the unessentials, you assess and you conceive your picture from what is before you.\\n\\nAnd so, shape, tone and colour: see it, conceive it, think of it, realise it, see your picture in your mindâ€™s eye, then pick up your loaded palette and your brushes and cover the canvas with the masses, the main masses in tone and subtle colour first; the details follow automatically as the pieces fit into a jigsaw puzzle. That has been one angle of my working method on landscape.\\n\\nItâ€™s quite a totally different technique on portraiture or figure composition. Itâ€™s a different thing altogether. Itâ€™s too involved to go into now.",

Cairns studied at the National Art School, Sydney in 2006, halfway through his three years as studio assistant to the late Adam Cullen. Immediately after graduation he began participating in group shows in Tasmania, Sydney and Melbourne. Since then he has held solo exhibitions in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Shepparton. Cairns co-founded an artist-run space, The Cosmic Battle for your Heart, which operated in Sydney from 2009 to 2011. In 2014 he created a commission for Shepparton Art Museum, and the following year held a solo exhibition, _The reader's voice_, at Heide Museum of Modern Art, Melbourne. A finalist in the Archibald in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and 2017, he was named runner-up in 2014 and 2015 with his portraits of Reg Richardson, now in the National Portrait Gallery collection, and Peter Powditch, purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Cairns' awards include the Brett Whiteley Traveling Art Scholarship (2012), which included a residency at the CitÃ© internationale des arts, Paris, and the Linden Art Prize at Linden Contemporary, Melbourne (2012). Cairns is the founder and director of Ankles, an artist-led initiative in Sydney, and curated the 2019 _Primavera: Young Australian Artist_ exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia."

                    "content": "Robert Campbell Junior, urban Aboriginal artist, was a Ngaku/Dhunghutti man who grew up in Kempsey, New South Wales. Although in the 1950s the Indigenous people of the region were actively discouraged from pursuing any of their traditions, Campbell's father was a boomerang maker and Campbell observed him at his craft, shaping wood and inscribing designs. Educated at the Burnt Bridge Mission School, from the age of fourteen Campbell worked in a series of menial jobs in Kempsey and Sydney. When he returned to his birthplace, he started to paint in earnest, depicting, as he said, his personal response to his environment, 'both past and present, the people, the landscape, and my own relationship with both . . . Aboriginal culture naturally becomes a part of my work as a reflection of my heritage and ancestry, but my message is to all people.' In the 1980s, shows in Sydney and Melbourne at the Roslyn Oxley and Christine Abrahams galleries brought him critical recognition. In 1987 he was the artist in residence at the Tin Sheds at the University of Sydney and he was commissioned to create a poster for the Bicentennial Authority. In the late 1980s he travelled to Ramingining in the Northern Territory; he found the experience of the traditional community totally new, and to a certain extent the visit influenced his subsequent work. His portraits _My Brother Mac Silva_ 1989 and _Sammy Alfie Drew: Local Macleay Aboriginal Sporting Identity_ 1990 were hung in the Archibald; in 1990 he had a solo show at the Rebecca Hossack Gallery in London. Campbell's picture _The Provider of the Tucker_ 1987 was hung in the National Portrait Gallery exhibition _A Face in the Crowd_ in 1997; his _Aboriginal Embassy_ 1986 was shown in _Open Air: Portraits and Landscapes_ in 2008."

The duo helped Australia win gold in the same event at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, with Cate swimming a blistering final leg to set a new world record. In qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics, Cate became only the third Australian swimmer to have qualified for four successive Olympic Games, and with basketballer Patrick Mills was named as flagbearer for the opening ceremony.

                    "content": "Judy Cassab AO CBE (1920â€“2015) was one of Australia's best-loved, most successful and prolific portrait painters. Born in Vienna, she studied art in Prague and at the Budapest Academy before adopting false papers and 'going underground' to escape the persecution of Hungarian Jews. After the war, she and her husband reunited and emigrated to Australia in 1951. Within months of arriving in Sydney, she was commissioned by Sir Charles Lloyd Jones to paint a portrait of his wife, becoming an Archibald finalist for the first time the following year. In 1953, she held her first Australian solo exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The winner of the _Australian Women's Weekly_ Portrait Prize in 1955 and 1956, by the mid-1960s she was sought-after as a portraitist, completing commissions for high-profile clients such as Princess Alexandra and Queen Sirikit of Thailand. In 1960, she won the Archibald Prize for her portrait of her friend, Stanislaus Rapotec; in 1967, she won it again with her painting of artist Margo Lewers. In all, Cassab had 41 paintings exhibited in the Archibald Prize. \\n\\nThrough her many other portraits â€“ both formal commissions and portrayals of family and friends â€“ she created a distinct record of Australian society from the 1950s onwards. Cassab also found inspiration for a more abstract style of painting in the landscape of the Northern Territory, to which she repeatedly returned, and won several awards for her landscape works in the Wynne Prize. Her many awards include an honorary doctorate from the University of Sydney and the 1996 Nita B Kibble Literary Award for her published diaries."

Then, as I developed in my other paintings, the portrait developed with it. I still think that every portrait I do is a failure because it didnâ€™t reach what I wanted to do with it. I think Iâ€™m best known as a portrait painter because these are the things that get most publicity, but I never wanted to be a portrait painter and I donâ€™t consider myself one.\\n\\nLately, I tried to combine abstract with the portrait but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good marriage. I think the best I can do is to paint my abstract pictures and develop them and develop myself, and let the portraits flow freely, because I donâ€™t believe that something which was art all through the centuries stops being art just because it lost its credit by the photographic portraits, the anonymous portraits, from which we have 300 in each country in the world; and although I know that it is a clash, I think, between my other paintings and the portraits, I canâ€™t give up. Itâ€™s something that interests me, and that I might solve or might not. Anyway, it doesnâ€™t matter if I solve it when Iâ€™m 70.",

He was the leading photographer for the Home magazine from the early 1920s onward, and his photographs of Sydney over a number of decades have become key images of aspects of Australian history.

Returning to Australia in 1931, she established a studio in Melbourne, producing pieces based on the simple lines of ancient Mediterranean art, and gained a reputation as a potent modern artist. Between 1938 and 1941 she made two huge figures for the Royal Hobart Hospital, a memorial fountain in Bendigo, panels for the Mutual Life and Citizen's Building, Sydney, and the massive figure for the Pioneer Women's Memorial in Adelaide. She then turned to teaching, while continuing to produce sculptures for churches. Late in her career she made the fairies' tree for Melbourne's Fitzroy Gardens. Cohn's work is represented in most major Australian galleries."

                    "content": "Ellie Cole AM (b. 1991), swimming champion, is Australia's most decorated female Paralympian. Two years old when she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer affecting the nerves in her right leg, at age three she underwent surgery to amputate the limb above the knee. Shortly afterwards, her parents enrolled her in swimming lessons to help with her rehabilitation. Swimming competitively by age twelve, Cole was fifteen when she competed in the World Championships for the first time, winning a silver medal in the 100m backstroke in the S9 classification. Having qualified for the Paralympic Games in 2008, she embarked for Beijing with few expectations other than to 'have a little bit of fun', but instead she returned to Melbourne with three medals. She broke the world short-course record for the 100m freestyle in 2009 and won another four bronze medals at the world titles in Rio de Janeiro that year. After winning six gold medals at the 2011 Pan Pacific championships, Cole moved to Canberra as the recipient of a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport. At the Paralympics in London in 2012, she won gold medals in the 100m backstroke, 100m freestyle, 4x100m freestyle relay and 4x100m medley, as well as two bronze medals. In 2016 â€“ having recovered from two shoulder reconstructions and having won three 2015 world titles â€“ Cole won medals in all six of her events at the Rio Paralympics. At her fourth and final Paralympics in Tokyo in 2021, she won silver and bronze medals in two relays. During her career she amassed seventeen Paralympic medals, four Commonwealth medals, three world titles and nine Pan Pacific gold medals. Passionate about the value of sport for people with an impairment, Cole appeared in _Rising Phoenix_, a 2020 Netflix documentary profiling six athletes who competed at the 2012 Paralympics."

                    "transcript": "I love swimming more than anything in the world. For me, swimming was particularly special because it was the only sport that I could participate in as a kid where I could take my prosthetic leg off, jump in the water and I could be the same as all the other kids. I think that when youâ€™re young, you just want to be accepted by all of your friends and a way for me to do that was swimming. Then I found after a while that I could actually be better than most of my friends at that sport and it gave me a really great platform to show all of my friends at school that I could still achieve things in a physical sense. Because I definitely wasnâ€™t running up and down beside them in the playground, but get me into a pool and Iâ€™ll beat you. That was always kind of the mentality that I had when I was younger. And so for me, like, the pool was definitely a great place of freedom. But it was where I learned how to back myself, how to be resilient, how to show the world what I could do. And then I found my way onto the Paralympic team with that exact same attitude and have since seen how the Paralympics can show the world what their athletes can do.\\n\\nSo I did that photoshoot with Peter right before the Rio Paralympic Games. And it was a moment where we really wanted to showcase the athletes of Australia that were going to the Olympics and the Paralympics. And so I was asked to do a photo shoot outside, which was really exciting for me to begin with. And then Peter put me on some really beautiful rocks with the Australian flag and I guess he kind of wanted to show what I wanted to do when I was younger, which was a mermaid, like, I always dreamed of being a mermaid when I was younger. And so to be able to capture that in a portrait, as well as you know, the strength and, you know, showcasing my disability as well and combining that into, like, my childhood dream with the inclusion of being strong and powerful, was a really great photo for me. And, you know, it's something that I've always looked back on, being really proud to have been involved in such a creation, but I always look at it and think that's not me, but it is. It's just beautiful.",

I feel that in that way I am doing what I can in the tradition of the founders of Australian painting, of painters like Roberts and McCubbin, the realistic painters who were the fathers of our tradition. I feel that my work is in, at least in their tradition, in contemporary terms and whatever I can do to add a picture of our times to our art, well then, I will do it.\\n\\nI think every artist has something of the philosopher in him; he is concerned to some extent with the meaning of what he sees.\\n\\nIn my own case, I have been and still am intensely interested in human relations, in peopleâ€™s attitudes and behaviour to each other, not just on a personal level but on the bigger, social level.",

Having worked for two years on Thursday Island for the Diocese of Carpentaria, he began painting scenes of island life. Comparisons with Gauguin are inevitable, though Crooke often painted people in dim interiors against a window giving onto bright light. A long-time resident of Cairns, he travelled extensively in northern Australia and painted some remarkably evocative landscapes, such as _Chillagoe_ 1962, _Landscape with rocks in foreground_ 1967 and _Ant Hill Country, Laura_ 1969, all in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. In 1966 he served as an official war artist in Vietnam. He won the Archibald Prize in 1969 for a portrait of a close friend, the writer George Johnson. In the mid-1990s he donated his collection of works by Drysdale, Friend, Olley and Boyd to Perc Tucker Regional Gallery, Townsville, which mounted _North of Capricorn_, a major retrospective of his work that toured in 1998-1999. Crooke is represented in all major Australian galleries and his work remains popular amongst collectors."

That is why I think that I found the pattern in the islands, the simple island people living in some sort of crude harmony with nature, so exciting and fascinating. This relationship is deeper than just a decorative pattern of people walking in tropical foliage, itâ€™s something which I have always felt myself. Iâ€™ve always been interested in the study of nature, from the smallest facets of insects up to birds and animals and plants, not in a scientific way but in a practical way, in a sense of wonderment; the beauty and the sort of mystery about them is very important to me. In fact, this feeling of wonder, to be able to sort of see these things with some sort of fresh vision, is the thing that I find most important to keep.\\n\\nThe relationship of the man to his environment is quite a problem pictorially because although I want to paint man in relation to nature, I also want to paint good paintings, that is, paintings that have the values of paint and colour and shape and so on. So all the facets of a good painting â€“ design, texture, and all the values and so on â€“ I try and I hope that I can weld them into this one simple expression of man in some form of dignified harmony with the natural world around him.",

In 1956, at the age of eighteen, she set a women's world record for the 200m at Moore Park, beating the record set by her compatriot Marjorie Jackson at the 1952 Helsinki Games. Cuthbert had tickets to the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games as a spectator, but she attended as a competitor, earning the nickname the 'Golden Girl' from the Melbourne _Argus_ when she won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4 x 100m relay; the first Australian to win three Olympic gold medals. The 1958 Commonwealth Games, the 1960 Olympics and the 1962 Commonwealth Games went badly for her, but at the Tokyo Olympics of 1964 she won the 400m, making her only the second woman to have won four different track races. During her career Cuthbert set sixteen world records. In 1969 she developed multiple sclerosis, and was a vigorous fundraiser for research into the disease, as well as playing an important role in the creation of MS Research Australia, established in 2004. In 1998, Cuthbert was named a Living National Treasure, and in 2012 she was inducted into the World Athletics IAAF Hall of Fame."

Well, I donâ€™t look at my subject as a person as we think of a person in normal circumstances; I think of my subject in terms of the medium in which I can express myself, that is, paints on a canvas, and I have to think of the limitations of this means of expression.\\n\\nI have only a certain number of coloured pigments which I can apply to a flat surface. And on a very sort of superficial analysis it can be seen at once that all that a painter has at his disposal to express his thoughts are colours which are light or dark in varying degrees, colours which are warm or cool, and certain shapes disposed in certain proportions. As we often say, we can only express ourselves by means of tone, proportion and colour, tone being the intensity of the pigment, proportion being the disposition of various shapes and colour, of course, is simply this matter of warmth or coolness. There is actually nothing else that we have to use. Weâ€™ve got no soul, no expression, no â€“ we havenâ€™t even got a three dimension. We have to give the illusion of a three dimension by the way in which we relate our three elements: tone, proportion and colour.\\n\\nWhen it comes to expressing a mood, well, we havenâ€™t any mood paint on our canvas, we have to arrange again our colours, our elements, in such a way that we can convey to the spectator some feeling which we have had.",

Born in London, Darling was schooled in England before serving as a major in the AIF during World War II. In the early 1950s he became a company director with BHP, a position he held for 32 years. For fifteen years during this period he was also Chairman of Rheem Australia and Koitaki Ltd. Inaugural Chairman of the Board of the Australian National Gallery from 1982 to 1986, in 1987, reflecting his interest in the visual arts, he founded the Gordon Darling Australian Print Fund, which has acquired over 6 000 prints for the national collection. In 1991 he established the Gordon Darling Foundation, which continues to provide funding and staff development opportunities for public art institutions Australia-wide. That year, too, he and Marilyn Darling initiated the Darling Foundation-sponsored touring exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery, the interest generated by which led to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery, housed first in the National Library of Australia, then in Old Parliament House and then in its own building on King Edward Terrace, Parkes."

                    "content": "Janet Dawson (b. 1935), painter, printer, teacher and stage designer, is known for her contribution to abstract art in Australia. Born in Sydney, she spent the first six years of her life in the rural New South Wales town of Forbes. Dawson's mother, who had studied art with Will Ashton, recognised her daughter's talent early and was advised by Ashton to encourage it. She had her first formal lessons following her family's relocation to Melbourne in the early 1940s, attending the private art school run by artist and illustrator Harold Septimus Power. In 1951, aged sixteen, she enrolled at the National Gallery School and attended night classes with Sir William Dargie. Five years later, Dawson won a National Gallery of Victoria Travelling Scholarship and went to London, where she enrolled at the Slade School and the Central School to study painting, etching and lithography. She travelled in Italy and worked as a proof printer in Paris before returning to Melbourne in 1961. She held her first solo exhibition the same year and in 1963 set up an art school and workshop, where she printed the work of artists such as Albert Tucker, Charles Blackman and Russell Drysdale. Dawson was one of only three women included in the renowned exhibition of Australian abstraction, _The Field_, at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1968. After several years in Sydney, Dawson moved to live in the bush near Binalong, NSW, in 1973. That year, she won the Archibald Prize with a portrait of her husband, the late writer, actor and playwright Michael Boddy. In 1978, she and Boddy founded The Bugle Press, producing fine art books and prints. Her work is represented in all major public collections in Australia, and has been the subject of exhibitions at the National Gallery of Victoria (1979), the National Gallery of Australia (1996) and a 2006 touring exhibition, _Janet Dawson Survey_."

Now I find that although I must work directly, I usually work on about three or four paintings and a series of drawings before anything final comes out of this. A final, or a finalised painting, quite often happens fairly quickly. With my particular method it must be very fresh. I find that very clean, very fresh colour is essential. I find tremendous sensual delight in clarity and finality of area, so consequently a painting canâ€™t possibly have any labour on its actual surface, the labour must go on in other places. And I find that the more I work, the more prolonged are these periods of making studies and drawings.\\n\\nI find that Iâ€™m continually going back to the figure as being something that contains so much, so many possibilities. Through exploration, probably like all good sensualists, I keep finding the figure in landscape and the landscape in the figure; areas of flesh stretched across muscle or relaxed, tightened up, loose flesh, delicate little veins, bony areas, are things that I feel with tremendous ecstasy that Iâ€™ve never yet been able to put down in any way, something that Iâ€™m trying very hard to do at the moment.",

                    "content": "Sir William Dobell (1899â€“1970), painter, studied art and was apprentice to an architect in Sydney before leaving Australia for Europe in 1929. On his return to Sydney after a decade he managed to impress conservative and modernist art factions alike. In the Second World War, Dobell served in a camouflage unit and the Civil Construction Corps of the Allied Works Council. Out of this experience, in 1943, came two portraits: one of Joe Westcott, a loudmouthed, indolent wharfie, titled _The Billy Boy_; and another of fellow artist and camoufleur, Joshua Smith. Both paintings were hung in the Archibald Prize exhibition that year, and the portrait of Smith was announced the winner. The decision was challenged, however, by a faction of conservative artists who claimed that Dobell's painting of his friend was a caricature, not a portrait, and who took the matter to court. Meanwhile, the National Art Gallery (as the AGNSW was then known) extended the exhibition dates and by March 1944 the painting had reportedly been viewed by over 140,000 people. The court eventually found in Dobell's favour â€“ his lawyers having persuasively argued that likeness and photographic accuracy weren't necessarily one and the same thing. Dobell was affected physically and emotionally by the controversy and gave up painting for some time.\\n\\nSlowly, the artist rebuilt his career; he won both the Wynne Prize for landscape and the Archibald Prize for the second time, with a portrait of Margaret Olley, in 1948. He won another Archibald in 1959, and _Time_ magazine commissioned his portrait of Robert Menzies for its cover in 1960. These and other successes of Dobell's, including his knighthood, conferred in 1966, did much to increase the status of artists in Australia."

Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia.\\n\\nI was approached by a magazine from America to do this particular job for a special issue that is coming out within a week or two, and for that purpose I had to travel to Canberra and interview the Prime Minister in the offices of Parliament House. And there I made my studies. They consisted of small watercolour paintings, and I think altogether I had about 40 minutes with the Prime Minister for this purpose.\\n\\nI always paint, as I think, a straight portrait and I go for the character of the person and, in this case, I think there was very strong character and Iâ€™d be very foolish to play around and do silly things with an international figure of that type. And I think I got a fairly good job done in the time allowed me.\\n\\nOh well, weâ€™ll see the results when they come out.\\n\\nUsually I like to get to know a person well before I do a portrait, sometimes at least a week, or have a few drinks with them or dine with them, to get them relaxed and to pick out their salient mannerisms. In the case of Mr Menzies, I have only met him once or twice over a period of about 15 years, socially, so I really didnâ€™t know him, which made the job more difficult. And in this particular case, in the surrounds of Parliament House and offices, there is a tenseness, and relaxing was really a frightening business. I couldnâ€™t really relax, and I had to take my studies away, then try to get everything from that build-up, with what I remembered of him. As I say, I didnâ€™t really know the man well.",

But with me it just stuck, and all through school I liked drawing much better than any of the other lessons., as a matter of fact I was very poor at the other lessons. In the town of Newcastle where I lived there were no opportunities to study art, so I took the next best thing. I became apprenticed to an architect. Although that was mechanical drawing, in a way it satisfied me for the time being.\\n\\nThen I was able to come to Sydney later on, and I gave away architecture and started to study art at an art school.\\n\\nAs you go through studying, you get more and more keen, and then â€“ well, you just get into it. I went away to England on scholarships and studied abroad and saw the best works all around the world. It really becomes a mania, eventually, in art.\\n\\nI have often been asked what it is that makes me want to paint certain people. Well, I think, first of all, itâ€™s the interesting form, the sculptural form of the person and the strong characters of a person, the strong individuality. And I strive for that. I donâ€™t know whether other artists do it or not, but personally I like to fit them to my style. I see them as my style of painting and try to bring that style first. Itâ€™s a sculptural technique, more like sculpture than painting. And if I see those things in a person, well, I strive for it like a piece of sculpture. I particularly like the Gothic type of sculpture, and I try to get that into my better works.",

                    "content": "Max Dupain OBE (1911â€“1992) was a pioneering modernist photographer. Born in Sydney, he received his first camera as a teenager and trained with photographer Cecil Bostock while working as his assistant. After setting up his own studio in 1934, Dupain established his reputation with portraiture and advertising work, gained exposure in the lifestyle magazine _The Home_, and photographed ballet dancers for the ABC, including dancers from the Kirsova Ballet and the three Ballets Russes companies that toured Australia between 1936 and 1940. While Dupain was on service during the Second World War, he briefly worked for the Department of Information from 1945 to 1947, photographing Australia for propaganda purposes. His then-wife Olive Cotton, one of very few professional women photographers in Australia, ran his studio. In the 1950s Dupain turned increasingly to architectural photography, collaborating in particular with architects Samuel Lipson, Sydney Ancher and Harry Seidler. From 1958 to 1973 he documented the construction of the Sydney Opera House. During the same period, he began photographing historic properties for the National Trust and recorded Canberra's new buildings for the National Capital Development Commission. In 1975 the Australian Centre for Photography mounted the touring exhibition _Max Dupain: A Retrospective 1930â€“1975_. This show brought Dupain's name to the attention of the wider public, and turned _The Sunbaker_, taken nearly 40 years earlier, into a definitive Australian image. Dupain continued to operate his studio on Sydney's Lower North Shore until he died at the age of 81."

And I looked through the catalogue of the retrospective exhibition just to check, and I find that all these pictures that I have in this show, 81 out of about 4,000, represent my responses to the environment in which I find myself, and thatâ€™s all there is to it. Thereâ€™s nothing world-shattering in any of these shots, they are just a simple and largely emotional response to an environment. Just little things: there might be grass growing in the sand, it might be a person, it might be a landscape at dusk, it might be an industrial operation at night. But this is my world. And I have no favourites. I just hope and worked towards the end that photography to me is my way of expressing my personal response to my environment. And thatâ€™s all there is to it.\\n\\nJust by way of a diversion, thereâ€™s a picture in the exhibition called _The Meat Queue_, which is a very good example of how lucky can you be. It consists of four or five old mums in a meat queue just after the war, in Sydney. I was doing a story on queues for the Department of Information at the time. I was in this butcherâ€™s shop and I just suddenly saw this action, and it was all over in a fraction of a second. Thereâ€™s movement in it, thereâ€™s a lot of intense feeling on the faces of these people, these women, and it has been one of the most, one of the favourite pictures in this show. But just sheer luck. There were half a dozen other photographs taken of this queuing operation in this butcherâ€™s shop at the time and not one of them are anything like this one.",

                    "transcript": "The true photographers are not interested in equipment as such, theyâ€™re interested in what it will do and this is the important thing â€“ through the man, of course, not just automatic equipment that will take of its own volition. It has to be manipulated.\\n\\nOut of this great conglomeration of photo machinery, I have selected a few cameras which I try to keep to a minimum. My favourite camera is the Linhof, itâ€™s a 5 x 4 format, and I come back to this thing time and time and time again. We use a Hasselblad also for quick work, particularly for portrait work, and also a 35 mm camera. You can do an awful lot of work with those three cameras, and I try and keep it in that simple form.\\n\\nThe same applies to film and print paper. For black and white work, we use one line of Kodak film, and our print paper all comes from Ilford which we consider the best available here.\\n\\nNow, for colour work, which is supposed to be the up-and-coming thing but I doubt it very much â€“ Iâ€™m essentially a black and white man but we do a lot of colour work because we have to â€“ but until colour becomes a very much more controllable operation, I think black and white will still be, or will remain the intrinsic, inherent photographic medium. If you go to an exhibition of colour photography by a dozen photographers, itâ€™s very, very hard to find out whoâ€™s done what, they all look exactly alike, because the operation is essentially a mechanical one and the personal ingredient is minimised.",

                    "content": "Geoff Dyer (1947-2020) was renowned landscape and portrait painter whose practice depicted Tasmania and its people. Dyer was born in Hobart and studied at the Tasmanian School of Art between 1965 and 1968. He started exhibiting in the 1970s while working as a teacher and then a lecturer, initially at the Launceston School of Art and then at Burnie Technical College. In 1995, he won an Art Gallery of NSW residency at the CitÃ© Internationale des Arts, Paris. Primarily a landscape artist, much of Dyerâ€™s work was inspired by Tasmania, his subjects including such iconic places as the Franklin River, the South West World Heritage Area, Cradle Mountain and Lake St. Clare. He was a finalist in the Wynne Prize nine times (1977, 1988â€“1993, 1997, 2004); and the Sulman Prize twice (1997, 2006). Dyer painted one portrait per year (generally of a fellow Tasmanian) for entry in the Archibald Prize. He became an Archibald finalist for the first time in 1993 with his portrait of environmentalist and former federal leader of The Greens, Bob Brown; and ten years later took out the Prize with his portrait of novelist Richard Flanagan. He was again a finalist in the 2011 prize for his portrait of MONA founder, David Walsh. Dyer was commissioned by the Tasmanian Government to paint the official portrait of former state Premier Paul Lennon for the Parliament House collection. Dyer exhibited regularly in solo and group exhibitions since 1970 and his work is represented in many collections, including those of Artbank; the University of Tasmania; the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Hobart; the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Launceston aand the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Hobart."

The time he set in that event, 3 minutes 35.6 seconds, was not bettered for seven years. Having been schooled amidst the sports culture of Aquinas College, Perth, the young Elliott pursued a severe training regime devised by his coach, Percy Cerutty, who would exhort him to speed up by reminding him that 'it's only pain.' Winner, also, of two Commonwealth gold medals in 1958, Elliott ran the sub-four-minute mile seventeen times, and he was never beaten on level terms over a mile or 1 500 metres. He retired from athletics in 1961, after three scintillating years at the top. Later, he served on the boards of companies including Australian Portland Cement Ltd, Puma and Ansell Ltd; he is currently Chair of the Fortescue Metals Group and the Telstra Foundation. A Living National Treasure, he carried the Olympic flame into the stadium at the opening of the Sydney 2000 Olympics."

Everyone told me you canâ€™t believe how fast it is and how many people there are and not only is it the most competitive with the deepest quality field, the most competitive field to race in, therefore the hardest to win at, it also goes far beyond the sport in terms of the public, the spectators, the number of spectators, but also the type of spectators. Youâ€™re still in a bike race and youâ€™re racing along roads but all of a sudden youâ€™re racing in a crowd of maybe a soccer stadium. And yeah, thatâ€™s sort of one race where youâ€™ll probably get beers spilt on you once while youâ€™re racing a bike. There might be 100, 200, 300 thousand people standing on the side of the road, and they all want to see one rider and if youâ€™re in the yellow jersey thatâ€™s really quite unlike anything else Iâ€™ve experienced in life. I wouldnâ€™t say itâ€™s healthy, three weeks is a long time to be in the limelight like that.\\n\\nObviously my 2011 Tour de France victory is what sort of shaped me as a bike rider and, I suppose, as an Australian sports person. Iâ€™m proud of how I got there and how I worked and the difficulties that I overcame to get there. Two years previously I became world champion on the road, I won the 2009 World Championship road cycling world championships and that was in a moment of difficulty. A lot of people in the world of cycling didnâ€™t believe in me. But I believed in myself, and I had a few key people around me believe in me and together we overcame what seemed like very difficult odds to do something that was at that moment in my sport in some ways historic.\\n\\nMy biggest thing that motivated me through my career was that one day, my opportunityâ€™s going to end and when that day comes I donâ€™t want to have any regrets that I didnâ€™tâ€™ work hard enough, that I didnâ€™t try hard enough, didnâ€™t make enough sacrifices or I wasnâ€™t dedicated enough. And when that day did come, I crossed the finish line of my last race and I left the world of competitive cycling at the top level in complete peace, with some pride and a great deal of satisfaction of what I had the opportunity to achieve and with those opportunities, what I achieved.",

In 1930, aged 36, Evatt became the youngest judge ever appointed to the High Court of Australia. Elected to Federal Parliament in 1940, he held the seat of Barton for 18 years. From 1941 to 1949 he was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs, and during this period he also served as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In 1951, he became Leader of the Opposition. In 1949, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was established, and soon thousands of supposed communists were threatened with jail in the event of a war. When Prime Minister Menzies attempted to outlaw the Communist Party in Australia, Evatt led the effort to defeat the proposal. A referendum saw the Partyâ€™s legitimacy confirmed. Evatt led the Labor Party until 1960."

As his gallerist states: 'Fielding combines strong cultural roots with contemporary views on the tensions between community life and global concerns. He confidently moves across different mediums, whilst pushing aesthetic and conceptual boundaries in central desert art. His works explore overlooked stories to create a stronger future'. Through his art practice, Fielding seeks to combine 'the cultural potency of the old with the spirit of the new, creating strong foundations for our community and culture to continue growing from.'\\n\\nIn addition to his art practice, Robert has developed skills across curating, writing and exhibition installation. As a finalist in the Macquarie Group Foundation First Nations Emerging Curator Award 2017, he was offered the opportunity to participate in an international exchange to Canada. As a participant in the Australia Council for the Arts' Signature Works Innovation Lab, he conducted research in museum archives across Australia. Working in installation, painting and photography, Fieldingâ€™s first international solo exhibition was staged at the Fondation Opale in Switzerland in late 2018. Fielding has been a finalist multiple times in prizes including the National Works on Paper Prize (Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery); the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA), the Bowness Photography Prize, and the Desart Photography Prize. He has won the NATSIAA Telstra Work on Paper Award twice (in 2015 and 2017); he won the Desart Photography Prize in 2015 and the Banyule Award for Work on Paper in 2019. His work continues to be shown in exhibitions across Australia and internationally, most recently in _Ceremony: National Indigenous Art Triennial_ at the National Gallery of Australia (2022), the _Tarnanthi_ tour of _KulataTjuta (Many Spears)_ at the MusÃ©e des Beaux-Arts de Rennes, France, in 2020, and in the exhibition _(un)learning Australia_ at Seoul Museum of Art. Fieldingâ€™s works are represented in a number of major public collections, such as those of the NGA, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Parliament House and Artbank."

After making short films and a feature film (_Modern love_), Frayne focused on photography, achieving success with his _Adelaide noir_ (2014) and _Theatre of life_ (2017) series and books. In 2020 he published his third book with Wakefield Press, _Landscapes of South Australia_. Frayne was a finalist in the 2012 and 2017 National Photographic Portrait Prize with _The seventy year old jetty jumper_ 2011 and _The hermit_ 2016. His series _The overseers of streets_, featuring powerful images of the homeless community, raised awareness of poverty in Adelaide. When asked in 2012 if he had any advice for would-be photographers, he said: 'Stop being obsessed about gear. Stop talking about megapixels and start talking about emotional impact.'"

Born in New Zealand, Fredriksonâ€™s training as an artist began with classes at the Wellington Polytechnic College, which he undertook while working as a journalist and reviewer. In the early 1960s, having completed a theatre design apprenticeship, he moved to Australia and assisted with the design for the Australian Balletâ€™s _Auroraâ€™s Wedding_ (1964). Resident designer for the Melbourne Theatre Company from 1966 to 1974, he designed a great number of productions for the Australian Ballet, the Australian Opera, the Western Australian Opera, the South Australian Opera and the Sydney Theatre and Sydney Dance Companies. From 1975 onwards, Fredrikson collaborated regularly with Graeme Murphy, working with him on many productions including _Body of Work_ for the Sydney Dance Company and _Tivoli_, a co-production with the Australian Ballet. His numerous awards include three Helpmann Awards and an Australian Dance Award for services to dance (1999). The Arts Centre Melbourne presented a retrospective exhibition of his work in 1995, and in 2008 the _Kristian Fredrikson Scholarship for Design in the Performing Arts_ was established in his memory."

On her victory lap, she famously carried both the Australian and Aboriginal flags. Born in Mackay, Queensland, Freeman's mother is of the Kuku Yalanji people, born on Palm Island, and her father was of the Burri Gubba people, born in Woorabinda. Just eight years old when she won her first race at a school athletics carnival, Freeman was coached initially by her stepfather. She had won a number of national titles before earning scholarships to boarding schools in Kooralbyn and Toowoomba, where she trained with professional coaches. Aged sixteen, she was selected for the Australian women's 4 x 100m relay team that took out the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, making her the first Aboriginal athlete to win a Commonwealth Games gold medal. She won two more gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in Canada in 1994 with victories in the 200m and 400m. The first Aboriginal track and field athlete to represent Australia at the Olympic Games, she won a silver medal in the 400m in Atlanta in 1996. She was ranked first in the world in her signature event, the 400m, in which she won back-to-back World Championships in 1997 and 1999. The first person to be named both Young Australian of the Year (in 1990) and Australian of the Year (in 1998), Freeman retired from running in July 2003, still enjoying the immense popularity she earned during her exceptional career. The Cathy Freeman Foundation, established in 2007, continues to enhance educational opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in remote communities."

Not long after he arrived, on the basis of a caricature he made during a political meeting in Martin Place, he was employed by the _Bulletin_, writing gag lines, drawing cartoons and supplying ideas for artists such as Norman Lindsay and Ted Scorfield. After 15 years at the _Bulletin_ Frith became the first daily cartoonist for the _Sydney Morning Herald_. Five years later, in 1950, over many drinks with Stan Cross, he signed up to Keith Murdochâ€™s _Herald_ in Melbourne, though he was later to doubt if a â€˜more incomprehensible contract was ever signed in such dismal surroundings at such an hourâ€™. Although its management tended to discourage the expression of his political ideas, he remained with the _Herald_ from 1951 to 1969. After he retired he continued to make caricatures in various forms, including a series of commemorative jugs for the Bendigo Pottery. Old Parliament House mounted the _A Brush with Politics: the life and work of John Frith_ in 2001; following the success of the exhibition, it toured WA, NSW and Victoria."

Settling in Melbourne, he became involved with photography and filmmaking, working with the ABC and training as a teacher. In the early days of the alternative theatre group the Pram Factory, he recorded productions and took portraits of actors and other performers including dancers at work at Margaret Lasicaâ€™s Modern Dance Ensemble. Applause Please and the widely-distributed Soft Soap, two of his early short films, featured Max Gillies; Camberwell Junction (1975) became something of a cult classic on the Melbourne and Sydney independent film scenes. While Gaal was a key figure in the Melbourne Filmmakersâ€™ Cooperative, having graduated from the Swinburne Film School in 1978 he worked at the Victorian Department of Education, directing many short films and documentaries including Tandberg on page 1 and Ibrahim (1983-1984), the latter exploring the experience of a teenaged refugee from Lebanon. Gaal was a finalist in the National Photographic Portrait Prizes of 2013 and 2015. Thirteen of his short films are held by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne. His work is favourably re-evaluated by prolific and esteemed film theorist Adrian Martin in â€˜Comment, think, analyse, experience and learn: The neglected film work of Ivan Gaalâ€™, Metro 2013.\\n\\nIvan Gaal believes his photograph of his friend George Spartels helped the actor win roles early in his career."

His practice ranges from representational landscapes to abstract images and installations and from photorealism to geometric abstraction as he 'seeks out the failings of images' and superimposes contradictory painting techniques. Gerber has worked in the Sydney University Power Studio in Paris, and in The Hague under the Samstag Scholarship. He is senior lecturer of painting at Sydney College of the Arts, University of Sydney and exhibits regularly in Australia and overseas. His remarkably diverse works are held by the National Gallery, the state galleries of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and numerous regional, corporate and university collections."

Soon a lead dancer, he performed with the Royal Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, the New York City Ballet and the American Festival Ballet before returning to Launceston in 1960. There he created Tasmania's first ballet studio, built behind his house in Wellington Street. He ran the Tasmanian Ballet School for many years, from which the performing ensemble known as the Tasmanian Ballet was founded in 1961. Gillespie travelled around Tasmania to give classes. His students included not only Graeme Murphy, who credits him as his mentor, but also Michelle Hawkins, Natasha Middleton, Claire McHugh and Glenn Murray. The Tasmanian Ballet performed and toured around Australia regularly, including in many primary schools, with Gillespie involved in every aspect of all its productions from 1961. By 1975 it was a state and federally funded professional company. Gillespie was its director until he retired in 1979 and moved to Newcastle for the climate. He received a knighthood from the Order of St John of Malta and of Rhodes in 1989."

                    "content": "Robert Hannaford AM (b. 1944), a largely self-taught artist, grew up on his family farm near the small South Australian town of Riverton before working as political cartoonist for the _Adelaide Adverti_ser from 1964 to 1967. In 1969 he won the inaugural AME Bale Scholarship. He took up painting full-time in 1970 with the encouragement of the veteran South Australian portraitist, Sir Ivor Hele. He has been a favourite in both the Archibald Prize â€“ in which he has been a finalist 26 times, and won the People's Choice Award three times â€“ and the Doug Moran Portrait Prize, which he won in 1990. Much in demand as an official portraitist, he painted the Historic Memorials Committee's official prime-ministerial portrait of Paul Keating and the official Centenary of Federation painting that now hangs in Parliament House alongside Tom Roberts' 'Big Picture'. In 2015 the Art Gallery of South Australia showed more than 200 of his works in the solo exhibition _Robert Hannaford_. Hannaford works in a studio in Riverton, where has painted hundreds of portraits, his easel placed beneath a skylight that enables him to exploit the full range of daylight. Enjoying the discipline imposed by a commission, he is open to ideas from his sitters about how they would like to be portrayed, finding that they often lead him into new ways of seeing and composing. 'I can find anything interesting,' he says. 'I could look at the corner of the room and find a painting that could keep me going for ages.' The National Portrait Gallery owns his portraits of Dame Joan Sutherland, Robert Dessaix, Alexander Ramsay, Tim Flannery and Lowitja O'Donoghue, the latter painted on commission."

                    "content": "Nicholas Harding (1956â€“2022) was one of Australia's most highly regarded artists, known for his portraits and drawings, and his light-filled, vigorously painted images of the bush and the coast. Born in London, he came to Australia with his family as a boy and attained a Bachelor of Arts in 1975. After a couple of years travelling in Europe and the UK, he trained as an animator with the cartoon company Hanna Barbera, and then worked as a freelance animator for over twenty years. Meanwhile, he taught himself to paint and was first exhibited in the Sulman Prize in 1980. He held his first solo exhibition with Rex Irwin Art Dealer, Sydney, in 1992, subsequently showing multiple times with Irwin over the next twenty years and exhibiting also with Philip Bacon Galleries, Brisbane and Sophie Gannon Gallery, Melbourne. Harding became known early on for huge pen and ink depictions of the railway tracks and shabby streets of inner Sydney, and the scrubby trees of the beaches of the north coast of New South Wales. His paintings on the same themes, as well as flowers, and beach and river scenes, became much sought-after by collectors. He won the Mosman Art Prize in 1993 and from that year onward featured regularly in the Archibald Prize, the Wynne Prize, the Dobell Drawing Prize, the Sulman Prize and the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize. In 2001, the first of several triumphant years, Harding won the Dobell Prize and triumphed in the Archibald with his _Portrait of John Bell as King Lear_. A major retrospective of his work, _Nicholas Harding: Drawn to Paint_, was exhibited at the SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney in 2010; and the Tweed Regional Gallery presented _Carving Light and Landscape_ in 2015. In 2017 the National Portrait Gallery presented _Nicholas Harding: 28 Portraits_, which encompassed everything from swiftly-executed portraits of anonymous sitters that Harding sketched mid-flight on airline sick bags, to lush, large scale paintings of sitters including writer Robert Drewe and actor Hugo Weaving â€“ both of which are held in the NPGâ€™s collection. \\n\\nHarding held residencies at the CitÃ© des Arts Internationales in Paris (2013) and at Bundanon, New South Wales (1998). His work is represented in private, corporate and public collections internationally and at home, including those of the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Art Gallery of South Australia and the National Portrait Gallery."

Inspired by an imaginary world, and sometimes described as 'luminist', her paintings often include incorporeal, surrealistic motifs in empty landscapes and express a sense of transience. She has exhibited throughout Australia and abroad, including the Frankfurt Contemporary Art Fair in 1993, _Contempora 5_ in 1999, _Uncommon World: Aspects of Contemporary Australian Art_ in 2000 and _Big Spooks_ in 2005. A major survey of her works from 1990-2016 was shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney in 2016. She has won numerous awards and prizes, including the 2014 Doug Moran National Portrait Prize for a portrait of her long-term partner, artist Bill Henson, and the 2016 Archibald Prize for a portrait of Barry Humphries. Hearman's works are held in public and private collections throughout Australia."

He was Australia's longest-serving official war artist, serving in North Africa, the Middle East and New Guinea during the Second World War and in the Korean War. The Australian War Memorial holds the majority of his works, including intimate landscapes, massive battle-pieces and sensitive drawings in chalk. His postwar paintings were occasionally shown at the _Adelaide_ _Advertiser's_ open-air art exhibitions. Although Hele painted landscapes (mostly of the rocky southern coast of South Australia) and made thousands of erotic paintings and drawings, he was best known as a portrait painter. He was much in demand as an official portraitist and won the Archibald Prize five times between 1951 and 1957, notably with his portrait of Sir Robert Menzies in 1954 and a self-portrait in 1957. Despite his success, he rarely exhibited his works and his last solo exhibition was at the 1970 Adelaide Festival of the Arts. Hele is represented in the National Portrait Gallery's collection with his portraits of Dame Nancy Buttfield, Sir Lloyd Dumas and Claude Charlick."

The son of a sheep farmer and a frustrated actress, Helpmann grew up in Mount Gambier, South Australia. At the age of eleven he made his stage debut, dressed in a tutu, at a charity concert in front of Dame Nellie Melba. Soon after he joined Anna Pavlova's touring company and went to England where by 1934 he was lead male dancer at the Vic-Wells Ballet (later Sadler's Wells). There, he formed a celebrated partnership with Dame Margot Fonteyn. Renowned for his dramatic and innovative ballet choreography, Helpmann was co-director and then director of The Australian Ballet from 1965 to 1976; during this period, in 1965, he was Australian of the Year. He appeared in twelve films, including _The Red Shoes_, which he also choreographed. Renowned for flamboyance and wit, at the age of 60 he performed as Dr CoppÃ©lius in The Australian Ballet's _CoppÃ©lia_ and he was still dancing two months before his death in the role of the Red King in _Checkmate_."

Markova then decided to leave and start her own company with Anton Dolin. And I thought, â€˜Well this is the end of the balletâ€™, when Ninette de Valois said, â€˜Iâ€™ve found a girl that youâ€™re going to dance withâ€™, and took me into the classroom and I said, â€˜Which one?â€™ She said, â€˜That one over there with the two long plaitsâ€™, and I thought, â€˜That funny-looking little girl?â€™ and I said, â€˜Whatâ€™s her name?â€™ and she said, â€˜Peggy Hookhamâ€™, and I said, â€˜Well, thatâ€™s not going to look very good on the notice board is it, Peggy Hookham?â€™ And I said, â€˜She looks Chineseâ€™. And she said, â€˜Well as a matter of fact, she was born in Shanghai but she is English. No, she was born in Reigate and she went to Shanghai as a little girl â€“ I want you to work with herâ€™. And the minute, of course, I saw her dance, I realised that she was absolutely wonderful, and Ninette said, â€˜Sheâ€™s going to change her name, sheâ€™s going to call herself Margot Fonteynâ€™. And so from that moment on, I danced with Fonteyn for 27 years and I suppose we became, at that time, the most famous pair dancing in Europe.\\n\\nIâ€™m always asked what was the most memorable performance or production, and itâ€™s impossible really for me to say, because so many things have been memorable to me. My first appearances with Markova, my first appearances with Fonteyn, my first appearances with Vivienne Leigh, the first time I played _Hamlet_, all of them. I have never felt for one minute in my life, â€˜Iâ€™m a successâ€™. I feel Iâ€™ve accomplished something and that is done and therefore there is something more to do. The success or failure of what has passed has passed and I must go on to something else. And whatever else I may have achieved in life, I hope that people will remember that my whole life has been dedicated to producing something of beauty in the theatre.",

Her first solo exhibition was held in Sydney three years later. In 1934 she travelled to London with her family, and remained in Europe until 1937 studying and painting. When she returned to Australia she returned briefly to Adelaide and before moving to Sydney, where she lived for the rest of her life. In 1938 she became the first woman to win the Archibald Prize, and in late 1943 she became the first woman to be appointed as an Australian war artist. Commissioned to depict the womenâ€™s war effort in the air force, the navy and the army, she completed more than 170 works of art before being discharged from service in New Guinea in 1946. While in New Guinea she met a doctor, Robert Black, whom she later married. Following her discharge from war service she went to London, returning to Sydney in 1948. She continued to paint, exhibit and travel with her husband. Her works are held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, the Australian War Memorial, the National Library of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery and several state galleries."

I like to gather a bunch in my hand in the garden, put them in a setting that enhances them, and to paint direct, to get the whole feeling of the bunch in the round.\\n\\nFlowers have always had that fascination for me, because I can remember when I was a war artist right up in the steaming jungle of New Guinea. Iâ€™d arranged myself a beautiful native bowl full of flowers and I was sitting in the mess, painting this, when I had a signal to be moved on down to Lae, and I ignored the signal, and the jeep came along to collect me to take me to the airport, and I said, â€˜Go away, Iâ€™m in the middle of painting flowersâ€™, and I continued with my flowers and got into hot water over this. The signals flew from New Guinea to Melbourne and back, and I was still painting my flowers, refusing to budge.\\n\\nI recall that picture and sticking it out, and I remember painting it on the mess table; I had to move every time a meal was brought forward, and it took me about four or five days to complete it, and Iâ€™ve kept that canvas, I called it _The Flower Sip_ and itâ€™s one picture that didnâ€™t go into the Military History Section.

Born in Sydney, Hicks completed a degree in communications at the University of Canberra and then pursued her interest in photography at the ANU School of Art. While earning a living as a commercial photographer, she maintained a private focus on her art photography, and entered various art prizes and exhibitions. In 2003, she won both the Fisher's Ghost Art Award for Contemporary Art in Campbelltown, and the Josephine Ulrick Photography Award for Portraiture in Tweed Heads. Since then, she has been making series of photographs of individuals that strain the definition of portraiture, finding, it has been said, 'beauty in perceived imperfections and render[ing] idealised beauty strange'. She had her first exhibition with Sydneyâ€™s inner-city Stills Gallery in 2005, and the following year the National Portrait Gallery included a series of her immaculate, unsettling photographs in the exhibition _Truth and Likeness_. In 2016 she completed a Master of Fine Arts at the Sydney College of the Arts, where she investigated the connection between humans and animals. Over her career Hicks has been represented in many solo and group exhibitions and her works are included in Australian and international collections. The National Gallery of Victoria held a major exhibition of her work _Petrina Hicks: Bleached Gothic_ in 2019â€“2020."

                    "content": "Cherry Hood (b. c. 1950), is an artist well known for her haunting, large-scale images of faces. Working for preference in watercolour, which she allows to bleed and drip, Hood specialises in intense depictions of mostly anonymous subjects. With a studio based in the Southern Tablelands of NSW, she has embraced her landscape surrounds, sometimes incorporating it into her figurative works. In 2000, Hood gained her masters degree from Sydney College of the Arts with a thesis comprising an investigation of 'gender politics and cultural mores and taboos surrounding the representation of the male body'. The following year she held her first solo exhibition at Mori Gallery, Sydney. Since then, she has exhibited in solo and group shows in Australia and internationally, including in the National Portrait Gallery's _Contemporary Australian Portraits_ in 2002. Following her Archibald Prize win in 2002 for her portrait, _Simon Tedeschi unplugged_, she won the Kedumba Drawing Award in 2003. Amongst her portrait subjects are painters Matthys Gerber, Ben Quilty and Michael Zavros, and pianist David Helfgott. Her portrait of Tedeschi is one of a number of Archibald winners in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Hood's works are in state collections around Australia and in public and private collections around the world."

She was also a model with Lee Madden's Promotions and Model Agency in Redfern, which promoted Aboriginal models on catwalks internationally. Following this she studied community development and worked in national Indigenous health advocacy programs, including a liaison position between the National Immunisation Committee and service providers offering immunisation programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Her Master of Philosophy from the University of Sydney involved an evaluation of immunisation activities provided by Aboriginal Medical Services and their reporting procedures to the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register."

She met Horace Keats in Sydney, and after hearing her sing at the New Zealand Soldiers Rest Room, he determined to make her his wife. They were married in 1918, and were to live at various addresses in Mosman throughout their lives together. Always addressed as 'Mrs Keats' by their friends, under the name of Barbara Russell she became the principal performer of his songs; he described her as his critic and guide. In 1946, the year after Keats died, Janet married the poet Hugh McRae; their marriage was dissolved two years later."

Having been persuaded to remain in the country to accompany Australian singers Ella Caspers and Peter Dawson, between 1917 and 1920 he was orchestral pianist and conductor for several operas directed by Count Filippini, and for three years from 1920 he led a trio in the restaurant of Farmer's department store. Soon after, he became involved in the formation of the ABC. During the 1920s he and his wife, soprano Janet le Brun Brown, began their long broadcasting careers; except for a short break in 1930 when he returned to England to work for the BBC as a conductor, he was associated with the ABC until he died. From 1933, when Keats began composing in earnest, he wrote more than 120 pieces. In 1934 he began setting the work of Australian poets to music. In 1936 he commenced a series of settings of Christopher Brennan's poems, to which he had been granted exclusive rights during his lifetime. These came to be regarded as some of his finest compositions. Amongst his other productions are some film scores."

He studied photography at the University of Gothenburg and had his first solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Boras, Sweden in 1992. Kenne's work has been included in exhibitions globally, and he has exhibited consistently in Australia since 2001. Displaying his deceptively simplistic but intimate style, his photographic portrait of his sons Cormac and Callum won the National Portrait Gallery's National Photographic Portrait Prize in 2009. He has published five books, including _Citizen portraits 1997â€“2012_, which was released in conjunction with his solo show at the National Portrait Gallery in 2012 and toured around Australia. In 2020 three of his portraits were selected for the National Portrait Gallery, London's Taylor Wessing Portrait Prize."

King makes drawings, paintings and prints that reflect his love of the natural world, in particular his interest in birds. He often creates works in book form, making drawings or prints on loose-leaf paper, then inserting these sheets into an open hardback book laid flat and deliberately 'aging' or preserving the book by covering it in wax, freezing it in position. The open book is then framed.\\n\\nKing's work has been exhibited widely and he has completed artist residencies in France, Morocco, India and Antarctica, which he visited in 2006 as the artist in residence for the Australis Expedition. Alongside his art practice, King has worked extensively as an educator: he has lectured on printmaking at the Victorian College of Arts since 1990 and worked as Senior Printmaker at the Australian Print Workshop in Melbourne from 1994 to 2023."

Born Ellen Wittrup Hansen in Copenhagen, she trained as a dancer in Paris, toured with various companies in South America and danced in Paris and London. A founding member of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo in 1932, four years later she toured Australia with the company as a leading dancer, turning in sparkling performances in _Petrouchka_ and _Le Carnaval_. At the end of the tour in 1937 she went back to England but returned early in 1938 to marry the Danish Vice-Consul in Sydney, Erik Fischer. In 1940 she began a ballet school in Sydney, and the following year she established the Kirsova Ballet. She employed several dancers who had stayed in Australia following the Ballets Russes tours to Australia, including Tamara Tchinarova, and took on some young Australian dancers who would later have significant careers, such as Rachel Cameron, Strelsa Heckelman, Paul Hammond and Peggy Sager. An important patron of Australian artists, composers and set designers, Kirsova commissioned designs for her original ballets from artists such as Loudon Sainthill, Amie Kingston, Alice Danciger and Wolfgang Cardamatis. The Kirsova Ballet folded in 1944, but Kirsova kept her school running until she retired to Europe in the late 1940s."

                    "content": "George Lambert (1873â€“1930), artist, was born in St Petersburg and lived in Germany and England before coming to Australia with his family at the age of fourteen. He lived on his uncle's north-west NSW farm, working as a jackeroo and becoming friendly with Breaker Morant and Banjo Paterson before coming to Sydney to work as an illustrator for the _Bulletin_. He studied at the Julian Ashton Art School in Sydney from 1896 to 1900, when winning the first NSW Travelling scholarship enabled him to spend a year in Paris. He was successful both there and in London, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy and the New Salon and gained a reputation as a raconteur and man about town. During the First World War, as the only official war artist to be appointed to the rank of Honorary Captain, he produced immense, violent paintings of the landing at Gallipoli and the charge of the Light Horse at Beersheba. When he returned to Sydney in 1921 he was the most glittering figure of the art world, and between 1920 and 1930 his paintings dominated the Australian art scene. At the same time, he encouraged a new generation of modernist artists such as Thea Proctor, Roy de Maistre, Roland Wakelin and Grace Cossington Smith. Toward the end of his life, with his pupil Arthur Murch, he created the figure of the unknown soldier in St Mary's Basilica, Sydney. For Sydney's Domain he also made the statue of another old acquaintance, Henry Lawson, a work, like his war paintings, that has significantly influenced notions of Australian identity. He won the Wynne Prize in 1899, the Archibald Prize in 1927, and was an Associate of the Royal Academy."

She began her performance career as a dancer at the Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre, later performing with the Bangarra Dance Theatre. In 1990, she made her acting debut in the musical _Bran Nue Dae_; she appeared in the film version in 2009. Her 1994 one-woman show _Ningali_ toured internationally in 1995 and won the Fringe First Award for best new production at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe that year. Lawford-Wolf performed in stage productions for Belvoir Street Theatre, the Black Swan State Theatre Company and the Sydney Theatre Company. Her film career included starring roles in _Rabbit-Proof Fence_ (2002) and _Last Cab to Darwin_ (2015), for which she was nominated for the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She also appeared in ABC television's _Mystery Road_ (2018). Off screen Lawford-Wolf was involved in community work in Fitzroy Crossing, advocating on issues relating to education and employment for traditional owners and becoming a director of the Indigenous-owned Kimberley Agricultural and Pastoral Company. In 2019, Lawford-Wolf tragically died while on tour with the Sydney Theatre Company's acclaimed adaptation of Kate Grenville's _The Secret River_, a production she helped to create. A cultural consultant and artistic collaborator with Bangarra Dance Theatre, Lawford-Wolf's legacy was honoured in their 2021 production _SandSong_, created in consultation with Wangkatjunga/Walmajarri Elders from the Kimberley and Great Sandy Desert regions."

And I wanted to write a theatre that was different, had all different forms of acting in it whether it be music, dance, singing, a monologue. And I wanted to stay in the traditional way of storytelling but make it real, make it different. And the only way, and the only way I can do stories like that was to fall back on myself and my plays, like â€˜You know, youâ€™ve got a story yourself, youâ€™ve been to Alaska when you were 16, you know, you lived here, you lived there, youâ€™ve come from Christmas Creek station, youâ€™ve come up from nowhere and make a name for yourself in the acting world and that is an achievement for someone my age. And I never really thought about it because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m anything special. I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m still quite naive in that aspect.\\n\\nI wanted to make it honest too, â€˜cos you look at a lot of Aboriginal people that are working out there, thereâ€™s a lot of Aboriginal women that are working but not really strong Aboriginal womenâ€™s stories. And I wanted to make my point of view as a woman and as a proud Aboriginal woman, proud of where I come from, whether than be the backblocks of Woop Woop but yet that place still has a very big significance for me. I wanted to make Australia realise that they do have an Indigenous culture in Australia. They have it here. No, no, and Australia doesnâ€™t need to go anywhere else and adopt someone elseâ€™s Indigenous culture which a lot of people tend to do. But, you know, they have it here. And nobody hasnâ€™t discovered it, itâ€™s so funny going to Europe, for me, and more European people know more about Aboriginal Australia than Australians do so which is quite sad, which is really really quite sad. It goes to show how ignorant white Australia is.",

                    "content": "Kerrie Lester (1953â€“2016) became well-known as a portraitist for her playful, textured, highly coloured works that appeared regularly in the Archibald and Portia Geach exhibitions of the late 1980s and the 1990s. Born in Sydney, Lester studied at the National Art School and the Alexander Mackie College between 1971 and 1975. She held her first solo exhibition in 1976 and featured regularly in group exhibitions including the Wynne and Sulman prizes and the Mosman Art Prize, which she won in 2011. Her bold and distinctive portraits, in which the outlines of the sitters are hand-stitched, were contenders for the Archibald Prize at least sixteen times and, from 1988 until her death in 2016, she figured in the Portia Geach Memorial Award shortlist nine times, her sitters including Phillip Noyce, Judy Cassab, Jeffrey Smart, Akira Isogawa, Jimmy Barnes, Margaret Fink and Trent Nathan. Her _Self-portrait as a Bridesmaid_ took out the Archibald's Packing Room Prize in 1998. Lesterâ€™s painting of athlete Cathy Freeman was among the first 50 works acquired for the National Portrait Gallery's collection. Art historian Gavin Fry has suggested that 'the appeal of Kerrie Lester's work lies in the way it embodies both the serious and the whimsical, the fleeting and the solid, the wry smile with instant recognition of our own weaknesses and excesses'."

I donâ€™t use pencil or crayons very often, I like to use a brush with a very thin medium, and I draw it in onto the canvas and then I do a lot of blocking in, and then I like to have my sitter back when Iâ€™ve done all the preparing, and then paint with my sitter present.\\n\\nSometimes, of course, I come into very difficult problems because my models havenâ€™t got as much time as they â€“ as I â€“ would need and I try and do as much without them from memory and occasionally have to have a photo taken, and try and do a little from that. But I donâ€™t think you can ever get the colour and the feeling trying to ever paint from a photograph. You must have the live person there and you get some inspiration from them as youâ€™re working, I think on portraiture anyway.\\n\\nI like to have my portraits with a feeling that they are casual and not in every detail, because sometimes I think I feel as if theyâ€™re overworked and have a very tight feeling about them.

Becoming friends with the Australian expatriate impressionist John Russell, he met Toulouse-Lautrec and others, but his own style remained conservative and he exhibited at the Salon and the RA in the early 1890s. 'Tall, handsome and charming', according to his biographer Leigh Astbury, 'Longstaff moved effortlessly in society circles where his skills as a portraitist were eagerly sought'. Indeed, his sitters included King Edward and Queen Alexandra. In London in 1907 he completed his colossal Arrival of Burke, Wills and King at the deserted camp at Cooper's Creek, Sunday evening, 21st April 1861, now in the collection of the NGV. During World War I he painted many portraits of leading Australian military figures (his cousin, Will Longstaff, painted some of the iconic paintings of the Australian War Memorial, as well as the portrait of Walter Lindrum now owned by the National Portrait Gallery). John Longstaff's 1923 painting of Nellie Melba was presented to the NGV from Melba's estate in 1932. John Longstaff won the Archibald Prize five times between 1925 and 1935; during this period, in 1928, he was knighted. From 1927 until his death in Melbourne in 1941 he was a trustee of the NGV."

Having held her first solo exhibition in 2002, she exhibited at Sydneyâ€™s Gallery Barry Keldoulis from 2004 to 2010; from 2010 she was also represented by Hugo Michell in Adelaide, and she is currently handled by Martin Browne Contemporary in Sydney. Her delicate, yet disturbing paintings are characteristically made using an airbrush and a restricted palette of soft, pastel colours. In 2008, she won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize for a self-portrait in the Belanglo State Forest, the site of a series of murders in the mid-1990s. In 2010 her work was included in Wilderness: Balnaves contemporary: painting at the Art Gallery of NSW. She was a finalist in the 2011 Archibald Prize with a portrait of artist Tim Silver and in 2012 she had works in the Wynne and Sulman Prizes. In 2013 she won the Fleurieu Prize with a landscape of the Shoalhaven and was highly commended in the Archibald with a portrait of Shaun Gladwell; in 2014 she won the Archibald with a portrait of Penelope Seidler."

Having signed to Sony Music Australia, she has so far achieved music sales over 3.3 million units, five top 10 albums, fifteen top 20 singles, four ARIA-accredited platinum selling albums and two ARIA Music Awards. Globally, her songs and videos have been streamed more than 292 million times. She made her film debut in the Australian film musical _Bran Nue Dae_ (2009); for The _Sapphires_ (2012) she received the AACTA Award and the Australian Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 2014, she became the first non-European solo artist to perform at the Eurovision Song Contest in Denmark. Two years later, Mauboy was the first Indigenous woman to achieve three consecutive weeks at number one for her album _The Secret Daughter: Songs from the Original TV Series_. Frequently characterised as a role model for young Australian women, in 2015 she became an ambassador for the Indigenous Literacy Foundation and in 2018 she was named an Australian tourism ambassador. In 2021 Mauboy signed with Warner Music Australia after 16 years with Sony."

It was just healing; music is a healing process for me. And Iâ€™m sure it kind of really takes people through their story, at times when theyâ€™re by themselves or when theyâ€™re with a ground of people or a crowd, you feel this permission to just, you know, have time to yourself and be you. I think thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so close with music, thatâ€™s why I have so much faith in it and I put everything into it, in the 15 years that Iâ€™ve been working my way of presenting music or performing or singing.\\n\\nIâ€™m always learning, I think Iâ€™m always kind of finding people that are inspiring me every day and Iâ€™m kind of taking a part of them, or a piece of them, or something that theyâ€™ve written or visually kind of, you know, shared, and just kind of reusing sometimes, or just kind of really taking that, putting it in some of my files and storing that and perhaps down the road, whether itâ€™s that colour or the sound that really will inspire me in making the music.\\n\\nMy kind of way of living is not trying to live in regrets. I think everything you do takes you a step further to being the best you can, being best at anything. You make a mistake, you gave it a go and you must try it again. And thereâ€™s always going to be a way out, itâ€™s just being patient with it.\\n\\nYou know, I think it is about being brave and trying to find whatever that confidence within you thatâ€™s so deep down there. Be kind to it and, you know, itâ€™ll come up every time you do it and you try and you get better at it. Be brave and always have that faith and belief in yourself, really.",

After leaving school he began work in a small advertising agency, where his growing interest in photography was encouraged. In 1963 he moved to Sydney, where he began freelancing for magazines including the _Bulletin_, _Vogue Australia_ and _Walkabout_. McFarlane's 1964 photograph of Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins on a Sydney bus is one of his most recognisable images. At the same time, as editor of the magazine _Camera World_, he began his lifelong career writing about photography. In the early 1970s he travelled and worked overseas. Since 1973 he has documented Australian society and key figures in politics and the performing arts, taking stills photographs on a great number of significant Australian films and theatre productions. He has exhibited in solo and group shows and has written regular photography criticism for the _Australian_ and the _Sydney Morning Herald_. His work is represented in the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of NSW and the National Library as well as the National Portrait Gallery."

In 1912 he travelled around Europe and the UK, and his landscapes were exhibited at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters in London in 1913. Back in Melbourne he held successful exhibitions and taught drawing at the National Gallery School from 1916 to 1934. Beginning in 1921, McInnes won the Archibald Prize seven times, writing in defence of his conservative work that 'in Australia we have not been bitten by Cubism or Futurism or other isms â€¦ and I am glad of it'. Sir William Dargie was the only artist to win more times than McInnes; Dargie employed a style similar to McInnes, of optical realism based on tonal values, which had been handed down from Bernard Hall, McInnes' teacher, via Max Meldrum to Archibald Colquhoun, Dargie's teacher. In 1927 McInnes was commissioned, with Septimus Power, to paint the opening of Federal Parliament by HRH the Duke of York. He went to London in 1933 to paint the Duke's portrait. The following year he acted as director of the National Gallery of Victoria, and became Head of the National Gallery School, a position he held until shortly before his death."

                    "content": "Noel McKenna (b. 1956), artist, is best known for his spare linear style and paintings of everyday scenarios, often featuring animals and interiors. He grew up in Brisbane, where he studied architecture before switching to art school. In the late 1970s he moved to Sydney, living in share houses and using an office in an old Elizabeth Street building as a studio. As the garment trade evaporated in Surry Hills, he took studio space there. For much of the 1980s he worked by night at the Cosmopolitan CafÃ© and Twenty One in Double Bay. Horses have been central to his art from the beginning, inspired by trips to the races with his father. 'Being a painter is a bigger gamble than being a punter, in terms of getting a collect,' the artist once observed. His first solo exhibition was a show of etchings of horses, at the Garry Anderson gallery in Potts Point. In 1993 he began painting on ceramics in a commercial shopfront in Newtown, and the following year had a solo exhibition at Roslyn Oxley9 in Sydney â€“ an assortment of horses painted on plates, with dainty dotted borders. He won the Sulman Prize in 1994 and has taken out the Art Gallery of New South Wales Trustees' prize for watercolour five times. Both the Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art and the Art Gallery of New South Wales have shown major series by McKenna. Twenty of his works were shown in _The Popular Pet Show_ at the National Portrait Gallery in 2016."

A co-founder, in 1975, of the Photographers Gallery, McNicol held his first exhibition, with Carol Jerrems, in 1978 at Brummels Gallery â€“ the first Australian gallery dedicated to the work of photographers. Soon afterwards, he moved into studio space in Fitzroy, and between 1978 and 1986 created a series of black-and-white portraits of his friends and contemporaries â€“ 'artists, actors, drug addicts and other fellow marginals', as McNicol has said. This series was exhibited in Melbourne, Cracow and Paris in the 1980s. In 1989â€“1990, McNicol undertook an Australia Council-funded residency in the cancer ward of Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, during which time he created a series of portraits of terminally ill patients, exhibited as Art and the Cancer Ward in Melbourne in 1992. Deeply affected by this experience, McNicol shelved his photographic practice for several years during the 1990s. He completed a Master of Fine Arts at Monash University in 2007, his major project being to recreate the portraits from the 1978â€“1986 _Portrait of Melbourne_ series. McNicol's work has been included in many solo and group exhibitions including the Australian Photographic Portrait Prize (2004â€“2006); the Olive Cotton Portrait Prize (2005â€“2008); and the National Portrait Gallery exhibitions _Reveries: Photography and Mortality_ (2007) and _Life and Time: Portraits by Rod McNicol_ (2015). The winner of the 2004 Australian Photographic Portrait Prize, McNicol was a finalist in 2007 and 2010. He took out the National Photographic Portrait Prize in 2012 with his portrait of his friend, actor Jack Charles, who McNicol has been photographing since the 1970s. McNicol's work is represented in major collections including those of the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Monash Gallery of Art, and the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale, Paris."

In 1944 he was drafted into the army and assigned to the military history unit as a photographer, working in the Celebes (now Sulawesi, Indonesia) as well as in Sydney, where he took the photograph that was used in the Department of Veterans' Affairs 1945â€“1995 commemorative campaign, _Australia Remembers_. At one time a professional boxer (his father was a well-known boxing trainer), he renounced the sport when his news editor complained that he looked too beaten around to send on photographic assignments. He won the first Press Photograph competition in 1951. Over the course of his career McQuillan photographed many prominent people, including Queen Elizabeth II and Richard Nixon, for a range of publications including _Woman's Weekly_, _Sunday Telegraph_, _Daily Telegraph_ and the _Bulletin_. In his late seventies he was still working as a press photographer in Sydney."

In 2008, just seven months after she broke her neck and dislocated her shoulder at a World Cup meet in Los Angeles, she took silver in the sprint at the Beijing Olympics. The first Australian athlete to win four medals in four consecutive Olympic Games, Meares collected 18 gold, 16 silver and 10 bronze medals at Olympic, World and Commonwealth Games levels. Among her many accolades, she was named Australian Cyclist of the Year in 2008 and 2012 and Australian Institute of Sport Athlete of the Year in 2007 and 2011; she was flag-bearer for the Australian team at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014 and for the 2016 Olympic Games. Now a popular motivational speaker, she has served as an ambassador for various charities, events and teams including the Little Heroes Foundation and Cycling Cares."

I come from the country, and so I asked Narelle to present me, I guess, in a slightly softer, more feminine way but allow the landscape that Iâ€™m sat in in this image to speak for the strength, the toughness, the resilience that Iâ€™ve shown in my career.\\n\\nWhen I met Narelle, I remember the first thing she said is â€˜So what do you think, what are your ideas?â€™ and I was so happy that she asked me first rather than giving me her ideas â€˜cos I was scared she was going to say how Iâ€™m going to put the bike here and weâ€™re going to put Lycra there. And then as I kind of explained to her how I felt about it and the ideas that I had, I could see, I think, she really resonated with it and she took it from there. So I kind of relied on Narelle around, you know, locations, given her experience of photography in South Australia and I said I was looking for something that could convey some contrast, I guess, between the softness of how I want to be presented to the harshities that the country and land can portray, and maybe the landscape could speak for some of the traits that Iâ€™m known for as an athlete but also the person, so â€¦ the tree as well, you know, itâ€™s struggling to grow and has grown for a very long time, and you can see the wear and the effect, of, you know, what itâ€™s gone through, the struggles, the challenges that itâ€™s faced, you know, you see the dead log in front of it where parts of it have broken off but itâ€™s continued to grow and I think that really symbolises the resilience and tough things that Iâ€™ve had to experience in my career as well.",

In 1916 he founded an art school in the city, and many students from the NGV school left it to join Meldrum's. They were the first of many generations of Australian artists known as 'Meldrumites', who were indoctrinated in what Meldrum believed to be the 'invariable truths of depictive art' and the 'science of appearance' relating to tonal and space relations between objects."

Originally a trampolinist, he competed at the World Junior Championships in 1999 and 2001 and won the double mini event. Spotted by Australian Institute of Sport diving coach Wang Tong Xiang, he began diving training while continuing to jump. In 2005 he placed twelfth in the 10m event at the World Aquatics Championships in Montreal. With his results on the up and up, in 2007 he took a break before switching to coach Chava Sobrino and returning to train at the New South Wales Institute of Sport. In 2008 he won the 1m, 3m and 10m individual events at the Australian National Championships and the Diving Grand Prix in Florida. In Beijing he fared poorly in the 3m springboard event, and entered the final round of the 10m in second place, 34 points behind. However, his final dive earned the highest single-dive score in Olympic history and he became the first Australian male to win an Olympic gold medal in diving since 1924."

It was really the first time [that] time disappeared for me, you know; I was so excited about doing it.\\n\\nMost people, even people who are really well known and photographed all the time, feel a bit vulnerable. Itâ€™s incredibly easy to take a horrible picture of somebody where they look really tense and they donâ€™t look like themselves. So, I guess Iâ€™m interested in people being comfortable. And Iâ€™m interested in, not the eyes that are uncomfortable andâ€™ how Iâ€™m going to lookâ€™, Iâ€™m interested in the eyes that try to get some sort of straight gaze where at least you have the impression that youâ€™re contacting the essence of that person. I mean, there was a phrase that I quite used to like, which was Buddha Nature, which means, you know, like that in you which doesnâ€™t change. Obviously, it can be damaged, but you can take pictures of quite small children. And you know that thereâ€™s something in that photograph that if you came back 50 years later, there would be still the same thing in it. And thatâ€™s sort of, I guess, what Iâ€™m interested in, really.\\n\\nTaking photographs is a bit like a temporary infatuation for me. Because Iâ€™m not interested in taking awkward pictures of somebody. So itâ€™s a bit like, you know, that process when you fall in love with somebody, they do one thing, into that one thing you attach all these qualities which they donâ€™t have, they just do that one thing. But you donâ€™t want to show somehow â€¦ you donâ€™t want to see the bad things in that state. You just put all the good things together. Iâ€™ve taken photographs of people who have looked at them afterwards and Iâ€™ve thought, yes, the person whoâ€™s in love with him sees him like that.",

                    "content": "Helge Jon Molvig was born and grew up in Newcastle, where he left school at thirteen and worked in a garage and at the steelworks. After war service in New Guinea and Manila, he enrolled as an art student under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme at the Strathfield campus of East Sydney Technical College. He exhibited with the Strath Art Group between 1949 and 1954 (thereafter, he was part of no group). During this period, from 1949 to 1952, he travelled in Europe, where he was particularly influenced by the German and Norwegian expressionists. In 1955 he settled in Brisbane, where he began to paint passionately intense and personal works that are now in the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Queensland Art Gallery. As a teacher, he encouraged a number of innovative artists including Andrew Sibley and Merv Moriarty to pursue their own visions. In 1961 he won the inaugural Transfield prize, the countryâ€™s richest art award, and was able to purchase land near Brisbane on which he built a house. Through the 1960s he won a series of art prizes in Queensland, and exhibited with the Sydney dealer Rudy Komon. Molvigâ€™s work is notoriously variable in style; his many portraits illustrate his many different approaches to his art. From 1952 he entered the Archibald, but was not hung until 1955. In 1966, his portraits of Charles Blackman and Sir Charles Moses were both hung; he won the prize for the Blackman portrait, which is now in the Art Gallery of South Australia. From the late 1960s he was increasingly ill with chronic kidney disease; he died following the rejection of a kidney transplant in Brisbane. A retrospective of his work initiated by the Newcastle Region Art Gallery toured nationally in 1978. Molvig is represented in all major Australian galleries, with his striking portraits dispersed between them."

I try to use colours that heighten the feeling of what I want to say. For instance, if I was painting a young girl, I wouldnâ€™t use browns and purples and heavy colours like that; Iâ€™d naturally use something thatâ€™s light and youthful and airy, happy, perhaps, depending on whether I wanted to make her happy or sad. If I was painting an old man, I wouldnâ€™t use light greens and light blues, things like that. Thatâ€™s only a very rough basis for psychology of colour.\\n\\nQuite often I use drawings, particularly in portraits. When I have a portrait commission to do â€“ not a commission necessarily but a portrait â€“ I usually do a lot of drawings. I like to become familiar with the subject, especially the character of the subject and the general feeling of it. I usually throw the drawing away and do the painting from memory. But usually now, with an ordinary subject, I just start straight on the large canvas and work it out from there. Once a picture is started, it sort of paints itself. What I mean is: when you put a brushstroke down, it indicates the next brushstroke to put down and so on, itâ€™s like doing a jigsaw puzzle in which you put one piece in place and you have to find another piece to fit in with it.",

And he introduced me to the authorities that were handling the staging of the play. And I particularly wanted to show the Parthenon at the top of the hill, at the top of the Acropolis, behind the action that was going on, on the stage. But this meant getting the floodlights turned on, on the Parthenon at a particular time. Now, I thought this would be very, very difficult indeed, but as it turned out, the authorities were only too pleased to co-operate, and they said â€˜No, that would be no problemâ€™, and â€˜we can do it at a certain time and if youâ€™re in your position at a certain time, everythingâ€™ll be fineâ€™, and they gave me all sorts of help from a position point of view; and I could roam where I wanted to and photograph this play and the environment on this beautiful night in Athens. And I turned to my helper and I said, â€˜Well, you know, this sort of co-operation is more than I could ever expect, itâ€™s beautiful.â€™ I said, â€˜All we want now, just when weâ€™re taking these pictures, all we want now is for the full moon to rise through the Parthenonâ€™, joking, you see. And he said â€˜Well, Iâ€™ll see if I can arrange itâ€™, so I thought that was very funny. So there we were, taking these pictures, and the lights came on at the right time, and he tapped me on the shoulder and he pointed up and I looked up and there was the full moon, rising right through the Acropolis.\\n\\nI took some pictures at that point but that was not the one that was used â€“ but thatâ€™s often the way it goes.",

                    "transcript": "In this book â€˜Australia and New Zealandâ€™ published by Life World Library, there are two colour pictures of Aboriginal children at Ernabella mission station. These children are of the Pitjantjatjara tribe and they have blond hair which tends to grow out in adolescence. And one afternoon we went out with about thirty of these children into the hills nearby, and as soon as we got there, the children virtually disappeared into the landscape, because theyâ€™re so sympathetic â€“ their forms and their colouring is so sympathetic to the rocks and the earth â€“ that you could hardly see the children in the landscape. The picture on page 114 tends to show this; the children are searching for rabbits and lizards and things in these marvellous rock forms.\\n\\nI found that these children [were] totally delightful, totally unsophisticated of course, genuine, happy, really beautiful kids. The light, of course, in this situation of photographing these children, was superb, it was bright low sun, and this accentuated this quality of fairness of hair that the children have, and the hair is very similar in colour and texture and the look of it in the picture, to the spinifex bushes which dot the landscape across the country there. But I find that whatever the light is, as a professional photographer you have to make it work for you one way or the other. There are certain things you would rather wait for and you have time to wait for, but very often the pressures are such that you just have to take it some way with what youâ€™re given, and make it work. And itâ€™s incredible how many times this can be done. I think that there was no problem in photographing these children â€“ the light was superb â€“ but to photograph them against the light so that the light is in fact coming through their hair, gives the hair more luminosity, more life, more movement.",

                    "content": "Lewis Morley (1925â€“2013) established his reputation as one of the key British photographers of the 1960s and is known for his iconic image of a nude Christine Keeler straddling an Arne Jacobsen chair. He ran a highly successful studio above London's first satirical venue, the Establishment Club, where he formed important associations with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Barry Humphries and a range of as yet undiscovered young talents including Michael Caine who frequented the hip venue. Many of the faces he captured on film define the swinging sixties scene in London, including portraits of Charlotte Rampling, Vanessa Redgrave, Judy Dench, Jean Shrimpton and Peter O'Toole. He worked extensively for theatre and television, becoming sought after for his particular style of 'on location' and 'action' photography and portraiture. Migrating to Sydney in 1971, Morley found 'the sixties all over again'. Despite this, working in a new country in a new decade his work underwent a dramatic shift in approach to style and format. Shooting increasingly in colour for magazines such as _Dolly_, _POL_ and _Belle_, Morley's Australian work provides an evocative record of culture change through the 1970s and 1980s. Portraits from this era include images of Peter Carey, Brett Whiteley, Nicole Kidman, Marcia Hines, Sherbet and John Newcombe. The National Portrait Gallery held an exhibition of his work, _Myself and Eye_, in 2003; _Lewis Morley: 50 Years of Photography_ was staged at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2006."

                    "content": "Arthur Murch, artist, is best-known as a painter in a colourful cubistic style, but he was occupied with sculpture throughout his career. Murch trained at Dattilo-Rubboâ€™s school between 1921 and 1925; meanwhile, in sculpture his most important teacher was Rayner Hoff. It was his sculpture that won him the 1925 Travelling Art Scholarship, which he spent most profitably in Italy. Later, his chief mentor was George Lambert, whom he assisted in Sydney from 1927 to 1930. At that time, Lambert was weakened by remnant malaria, and he greatly valued Murchâ€™s strength, calling him the â€˜pocket Herculesâ€™. They worked together on the figure for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in St Maryâ€™s Cathedral, and Murch completed the Henry Lawson Memorial after Lambert died in 1930. Other works Murch produced around the period of his association with Lambert include the memorial to Thorburn Brailsford Robertson in Adelaide University, and the Macarthur Onslow Memorial Light Horse Trophy. In 1933 he travelled with a scientific expedition to Hermannsburg, and he returned to the mission the following year. Many of his paintings reflect his interest in Indigenous culture and practises. In the late 1930s he was in the UK, and worked on the wool pavilion at the Glasgow Empire Exhibition. In 1941 he won the competition to execute the memorial relief in honour of Dame Nellie Melba in the Sydney Town Hall. During World War 2 he was an official war artist in the Northern Territory, working in Darwin and around the Adelaide River. Perhaps because his father was a carpenter-builder and he himself trained as an engineer, Murch sculpted in all imaginable media including fibreglass, rubber, pottery, stitched felt applique and cement - the latter when restoring Norman Lindsayâ€™s garden sculptures. He was a foundation member of the Australian Academy of Art; he won the Society of Artistsâ€™ Medal in 1935 and the Archibald Prize for 1949. The 1977 exhibition _Project 19: Arthur Murch_ at the Art Gallery of New South Wales was the first major survey of Murchâ€™s work by a public gallery. Now, the Art Gallery of New South Wales has many of his works; the Australian War Memorial has more than thirty of his paintings and drawings and he is represented in most Australian public galleries. The papers of Arthur Murch, collated by Ria Murch, are in the archive of the Art Gallery of New South Wales."

                    "content": "Graeme Murphy AO (b. 1950), choreographer and dancer, was co-artistic director of the Sydney Dance Company with his wife Janet Vernon AM for three decades. Born in Melbourne, Murphy grew up in Mole Creek, Tasmania, taking dance classes in Launceston. At age fourteen he was the youngest male dancer to be accepted into The Australian Ballet School in Melbourne; he commenced with The Australian Ballet three years later and choreographed his first ballet, _Ecco le Diavole_, in 1971. That year he received an Australia Council Grant to study overseas, studying with the Joffrey Ballet in New York, and dancing with the Royal Ballet in England and Les Ballets FÃ©lix Blaska in France. Back in Australia, he was appointed artistic director of the Sydney Dance Company (then known as The Dance Company NSW) in 1976, helping it to become one of Australia's most successful dance companies. His most popular piece is perhaps _Poppy_ (1978), a full-length ballet based on the life of Jean Cocteau, in which he danced the title role four years after announcing his retirement. In 2001 Murphy was presented with a Helpmann Award for _Body of Work: A Retrospective_; he won Australian Dance Awards for outstanding achievement in choreography for Tivoli in 2001 and Swan Lake in 2003. Named a Living National Treasure in 1999, Murphy retired from the Sydney Dance Company in 2007 after creating a repertoire of more than 50 works. Over the years he has also created productions for companies including Opera Australia, The Australian Ballet, Shanghai Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. His honours include the 2009 Best Choreography Green Room Award for _Firebird_ and the 2011 Fred & Adele Astaire Award for excellence in choreography for _Mao's Last Dancer_. He was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in June 2012 for his distinguished contribution to Australian dance. Murphy continues to direct and choreograph productions, including _Turandot_ (2019) and _The Merry Widow_ (2021) for Opera Australia."

                    "content": "Born in Maitland, New South Wales in 1975, Nell is a multidisciplinary artist working across painting, sculpture, video and performance. Through a unique signature style influenced by the fusion of religious iconography, rock 'n' roll aesthetics and Buddhist philosophy, her work explores the intersections and oppositional aspects of the human existence â€“ birth and death, sacred and profane, sorrow and happiness, light and dark.\\n\\nThroughout her practice, Nell uses reoccurring and repetitive symbolic motifs as a tool for communicating the binaries of human existence. Her works are created using an array of materials and objects, ranging from the sacred to the pop with symbols such as smiley faces, ghosts, tear drops and lighting bolts conveying universal meanings of each icons. Often, a range of egg shapes are used to represent ideas of rebirth, regeneration and consider concepts of mortality. This fusion further highlights Nells interrogation and concern with time, death and impermanence. Music and art are inseparable for Nell, with the iconography associated with rock 'n' roll and pop culture heavily influencing her works. Objects such as band T-shirts, posters, album covers and guitar picks are considered personal devotional items and are often repurposed to be given a new life within an artwork. Through both large-scale immersive installation to intimate objects, Nell's practice embodies the nuances of the human condition while simultaneously amplifying the tensions, and differences to create new everyday rituals through the prescription of meaning to objects.\\n\\nAcross two decades, Nell's work has been included in over 300 exhibitions in Australia and abroad. Early in her exhibiting career, she was selected for _Primavera: Young Australian Artists at the Museum of Contemporary Art_, Sydney (1999), the annual curated exhibition of Australian artists aged under 35 years. Her early solo exhibitions â€“ often collaborations with Mel O'Callahan - were in small venues in Sydney, Los Angeles, the Netherlands and Mumbai. In 1999 she founded the Rubyayre artist-run gallery in Sydney. Her first solo show at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery was in 2001and she has exhibited regularly there since. In 2003 and 2012 she exhibited _Nell_ and _Hometown girl has wet dream_ at the Maitland Regional Art Gallery. In between, in 2006 she gained her master's degree from Sydney College of the Arts, partly completed on a scholarship at the Ecole Nationale SupÃ©rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris. Her other awards include the Pat Corrigan Grant in 1999, the National Association for the Visual Arts Marketing Grant in 2001 and the Rome Studio of the Australia Council in 2003. She has several times been a finalist in the Blake Prize for Religious Art; her projects include a collaboration with the fashion label Romance Was Born in 2011. In 2011 and 2012 her work was included in the exhibitions _MONANISM_ and _Theatre of the World_ at MONA, Hobart. Well-known around Sydney as the long-term partner of celebrated chef Kylie Kwong, in late 2012 she was curator of the MCA ARTBAR. In 2013 she won the $50 000 University of Queensland National Artists' Self-Portrait Prize with a video of herself using a cricket bat to destroy a huge plastic fly (initially exhibited as _Fly as high as me_ in 2002).\\n\\nOther significant exhibitions include: _Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art 2016: Magic Object_, Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide (2016); _The National: New Australian Art, Museum of Contemporary Art_, Sydney (2017); and _Know My Name: Australian Women Artists 1900 to Now_, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra (2021). In 2016, Shepparton Art Museum presented an eponymously titled survey exhibition of Nell's works, _NELL_. A monograph on her work, published by Thames and Hudson, was released in 2020."

                    "content": "Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920â€“1993), formerly Kath Walker, was a Quandamooka woman, activist, poet, writer and educator. Born in Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island) in Queensland, she enlisted in the Australian Women's Army Service in 1942 before beginning her career in political activism. In the 1940s she was a member of the Communist Party of Australia, which opposed racial discrimination. She became Queensland State Secretary of the Federal Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advancement in 1961, and campaigned successfully for amendments to Sections 51(xxvi) and 127 of the Constitution in 1967. In the 1970s she chaired a number of bodies set up to promote Indigenous interests, including the Queensland Aboriginal Advancement League. Throughout her life, she aimed to promote cultural pride among Aboriginal people through her writing, which she described as 'sloganistic, civil rightish, plain and simple'. Her first book of poetry, _We are Going_, published in 1964, was the first poetry publication by an Aboriginal person. Noonuccal returned to Minjerribah in 1971 where she taught Aboriginal culture to thousands of school children, and published two children's books: _Stradbroke Dreamtime_ (1972) and _Father Sky and Mother Earth_ (1981). Having gained world acclaim for her writing and advocacy (for which she was also conferred with four honorary doctorates), she published her last collection of poems, _Kath Walker in China_, in 1988. That year, she reassumed her tribal name in protest at the Bicentennial celebrations, and returned the MBE she had been awarded in 1970."

There was a deputation from all over Australia of Aboriginal spokesmen and women and we did go in. Sir Robert Menzies had told the public and the politicians, the people of the House, that he would not have a referendum in his lifetime as prime minister. Heâ€™d been badly beaten on the referendum before where he had appealed to the people to outlaw Communism and when the people said â€˜No outlawing of the Communist Partyâ€™, Sir Robert Menzies refused then to have anything to do with referendums in his lifetime as prime minister.\\n\\nWe lobbied the House of Parliament and itâ€™s to their discredit, really, that when we asked them to bring out the laws concerning the Aboriginal people that there was no laws, no books on the Aboriginal people in their archives or libraries, and they had to quickly have them printed, so that the politicians could read what it was, for and against the Aborigines. There was one, however, on the national â€“ the Canberra law book saying that if Aboriginals go into Canberra, any Justice of the Peace could declare them illegal immigrants into Canberra and they could be chased out of Canberra. This still applied to us, incidentally, at this period of time. And we always made a joke of it when we went to Canberra, you know, â€˜If you get into trouble, you know the law on the book. If a JP says Get Out, make sure you get your blanket,â€™ because the law still said that before sending them out of Canberra, they must first issue them with one government blanket. So we were determined weâ€™d get our government blanket if ever they threw us out.  \\nWe told everyone this and we made it a laughingstock â€“ Canberra a laughingstock â€“ to such an extent that the first thing Sir Robert Menzies did was delete that off the Canberra constitution. So itâ€™s no longer there.",

                    "transcript": "I would say that the majority of the Australian people voted Yes in favour of the Aboriginal people merely to clear their guilty conscience. Itâ€™s easy to put a mark on a ballot paper, and I must say this definitely, that there was a small minority group of sincere Australian people but I would say 75 [per cent] of those who voted Yes did it to clear their guilty conscience.\\n\\nIncidentally, itâ€™s interesting to understand why those terrible discriminative laws were put into the books. In the first place, our civic fathers, or the white manâ€™s civic fathers of long ago, during the â€˜soothing of the dying pillowâ€™ era, the politicians, or the statesmen of that time, were writing over to Queen Victoria saying, â€˜The Aborigine is dying out.â€™ And true, he was â€“ they were poisoning him with strychnine in the waterholes and they were shooting him, and they were doing all sorts of things. And the Aborigine dropped from 300,000 strong to 80,000 in a very short period of time. So it was quite natural for them to say the Aborigine was a dying race.\\n\\nNow it was during this period of time that the Constitution was being fixed, and as they thought we were a dying race, to save themselves a lot of bother they said, â€˜Well we will not count the Aborigines and we do not have to make laws for the Aborigines, because theyâ€™re going to die out anywayâ€™. And this is the reason today why Aboriginals have not had any education, any decent housing, any facilities that the white Australian enjoys today. Itâ€™s because of that stupid business of thinking the Aboriginals were going to die out.\\n\\nMind you, the Aboriginals are a determined lot, and theyâ€™re quite ungrateful. They didnâ€™t die, they lived on and are still living on; in spite of the many attempts to commit genocide and assassinate us all, we are still here. I think weâ€™ll last the white man out, truly.",

He resigned from office in 2001 following an enquiry established to investigate a government contract. From 2002 to 2006 he was Australiaâ€™s consul-general in Los Angeles, in which capacity he initiated the enduringly successful Australia Week, a significant driver of American tourism, trade and investment in Australia.

Her first solo exhibition was in 1981, by which time she had exhibited in both the Archibald and Portia Geach competitions. She has won the Peopleâ€™s Choice Award of the Archibald three times, with portraits of Paul Lyneham (1992), Bill Leak (1995) and Patrick Dodson (1998), and she won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize in 1994 with a portrait of her father, veteran _Womenâ€™s Weekly_ illustrator John Mills. Palaitis had painted John Howard for the Archibald Prize competition of 1979, and otherwise knew the Howards slightly as their children had been at the same preschool. When she was chosen for the commission, the three met at Kirribilli House to discuss her conception of the work. As she took many informal snaps of them in different areas of the grounds, the interaction between the artist and her subjects became freer. Unlike many portraitists, Palaitis is happy to show her sitters the work as it evolves from photographs to watercolour studies to the final canvas, and the Howards viewed it several times over the course of the 650 hours it took her to paint in her studio. In response to media and public interest in the work, Palaitis maintained that â€˜foremost in my mind was to portray, in whatever way, a sense of relationship between the coupleâ€™, whom she found â€˜sincere and unpretentiousâ€™."

He was President of the Australian Art Society in 1951, and later a member of the Royal Art Society of NSW and the St George Art Society. From 1950 onward he travelled extensively in Central Australia, and throughout the sixties painted views of desert landscapes and Aboriginal people. In the early sixties he taught art at evening classes at Sutherland School, and also worked sporadically as an art critic for the Mirror newspaper group and a broadcaster for the BBC in London. However, his principal employment was producing advertising material for the Sydney County Council. He held many solo and group shows in Sydney from 1960 onward, and won municipal art awards in Kogarah, Campbelltown and Rockdale. In 1970 his work was featured in an 'Art Sale for Land Rights' at Paddington Town Hall with proceeds going to the New South Wales, Kimberley and North Queensland Aboriginal Land Councils. He is represented in the Art Gallery of New South Wales; the National Library; the Newcastle Art Gallery; the Howard Collection (Armidale); the Sutherland Shire Council; the National Bank in Adelaide; the Commonwealth Advisory Board; and in private collections in Australia and abroad."

Sometimes I would, of course, sketch, mostly with pencil, and where portraits were concerned, directly on the canvas with paint. Later on, after coming back from England, I used to make more sketches but I did my painting, the actual portrait, directly from the sitter. In those days you could get a sitter to sit still but nowadays they donâ€™t sit still, they want everything done in a hurry so that the method has to change. It takes very much longer to paint a portrait than it used to, simply because you canâ€™t get your sitter.\\n\\nIn my _Portrait of Richard_, [a] schoolboy about 12 years of age, I remember that I painted him or drew him in, first of all, with terre verte and then painted directly in colour. It took me about three weeks. He came and stayed with me and so we worked every day.\\n\\nIn a portrait I try to get the character as well as the outside resemblance of the sitter, to get the feeling, because that would be your feeling of the sitter; it wouldnâ€™t be the sitterâ€™s feeling of you, fortunately. In this particular case I was very fortunate. Itâ€™s a portrait of my nephew and he was very co-operative indeed.",

Born in Melbourne, she grew up in Adelaide after her father was signed to play for Port Adelaide in the SANFL. She started playing football with the Westlakes under-9s (she was the only girl on the team), and as a teenager trained occasionally with Port Adelaide. At the same time â€“ there being next to no opportunities for women wanting to play football professionally â€“ she took up basketball, representing South Australia in the under-16 and under-18 national championships. Phillips made her professional debut in 2002 when she joined the Adelaide Lightning. In her six seasons with the team she was selected for the WNBL all-stars three times and contributed to the Lightning's 2007-08 championship victory. Concurrently, she began playing in the USA having been drafted by the Connecticut Sun of the WNBA. In 2011 she joined the Indiana Fever, which won the WNBA title for 2012; Phillips became a WNBA championship player for the second time in 2014 with the Phoenix Mercury. She left the WNBA in 2017 after one season each with the LA Sparks and Dallas Wings, and having played in the professional leagues in Israel, Poland and Slovakia. Phillips first represented Australia at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in 2006, when the Opals won the women's basketball gold medal. She was part of the Opals squad that won silver at the Beijing Olympics, gold at the 2006 World Championships in Brazil, and bronze at the 2014 World Championships in Turkey. \\n\\nDespite not having played a game of football for more than a decade, in 2017 Phillips was signed by the Adelaide Crows, one of eight teams contesting the inaugural AFL Women's season. She finished the season with a premiership medal and was named the AFLW's best and fairest player, also winning the AFLW Players' Association Most Valuable Player award and the title of the Crows' Club Champion. Phillips was named best and fairest again in 2019, when the Crows won their second premiership; and she became a premiership player for a third time when the Crows defeated Melbourne in the 2022 Grand Final. Shortly afterwards, Phillips announced that she had been signed by Port Adelaide â€“ the club she has always dreamt of playing for."

It means that you can be interested in people you are painting; doesnâ€™t necessarily follow that youâ€™re always interested in the particular job youâ€™re doing, although you make the best of it you can. Some sitters are more sympathetic than others and if you get no co-operation from a sitter it makes it very heavy going. However, you try to make the most of the composition and take some other interest in it.\\n\\nI think that my attitude to a portrait has to be reasonably objective, itâ€™s impossible to get rid of the artistâ€™s subjectivity altogether and necessarily one person sees another person in a slightly different light to what the next one would, and that does always condition your choice of position and your choice of light and your choice of angle and of expression that youâ€™ll put on a sitter. Nevertheless, I still, in a portrait, like to get more information about the sitter than I do about the artist who painted it. I think the work can be a work of art and yet be reasonably objective.\\n\\nBut Iâ€™ve had the experience that if I put what I thought was a reasonably amiable expression on a personâ€™s face and it seems to be an amiable person to me and the family accept that, to somebody else itâ€™s a supercilious smirk just because they donâ€™t like the person in any case, so that to the beholder all things are true. So that by this type of objectivity, youâ€™re not completely bound down to the limitations of pure subjectivity which emphasises and underlines one personâ€™s relation to the object at which heâ€™s looking.",

                    "content": "Clifton Pugh AO was one of Australiaâ€™s best-known artists of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and one of its leading advocates for the arts. Born in Richmond, he grew up in Melbourne, moving to Adelaide as a teenager. There, while waiting to enlist, he attended evening classes at the South Australian School of Art. After serving with the AIF, and then for a year in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, he returned to Australia to pursue a career as an artist. Under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Scheme, he attended classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, training under Sir William Dargie. Although a favourite of Dargieâ€™s, soon after completing his course Pugh did away with tonalism, developing a style that is at once expressionistic and figurative, seeking to fuse successfully the rival approaches to painting the virtues of which the arts community debated so passionately in the 1950s. In 1959 he was one of seven artists who signed the Antipodean Manifesto. As Pughâ€™s popularity grew, so too did the demand for a portrait by him, which increased with his second and third Archibald victories in 1971 and 1972. Reluctant to accept commissions for portraits, he preferred to paint people with whom he had developed some degree of spiritual, intellectual or imaginative connection. These came to include some of Australiaâ€™s leading artists, philanthropists and academics. Pugh is now best remembered, however, for his portraits of politicians; his own deep interest in the arts and politics emerged publicly in his chairmanship of the Arts and Cultural Policy Committee of the Victorian Branch of the ALP from 1971. Once described as a court painter to the Australian Labor Party, he portrayed many of its key figures, including Gough Whitlam, Don Dunstan, Clyde Cameron, Clyde Holding, Lionel Murphy and Tom Uren. Yet, moved by various impulses, he also completed portraits of other politicians and statesmen, amongst them Harold Holt, John McEwen, Viscount de Lâ€™Isle, the Duke of Edinburgh and Sir John Kerr."

But always very upset because whenever they were aware of me, theyâ€™d gallop off, and I used to feel, if I could let them know that Iâ€™m not going to harm them. But perhaps because of other human beings they were scared. And my feeling the whole time was, if I could only get the birds and animals to realise that Iâ€™m not going to harm them.\\n\\nI saw one kangaroo had been shot and I was really upset about this and I used to go back and look at this â€“ remains. Then I got a shock the following spring, that the animal had practically disintegrated, but out of that area where this animal had died, there were these most beautiful orchids. And that gave me the realisation of this continuing cycle, is that this kangaroo had to die to produce something in the soil that produced these orchids, because they werenâ€™t anywhere else, they were just in this one spot. So all the paintings from then on, right up â€˜til halfway through â€™64, were of birds and animals, and this continuing cycle, always the paintings took the form, organic form of a movement, you could almost call it like a circle, â€˜til this trip came up to the north-west, up to the Kimberleys. There I had a very, very big change of feeling. As I said before, I felt myself not belonging to the world â€“ we were some mistake. Going up there, I felt myself starting to belong for the very first time, and itâ€™s made a big change to the paintings, because now Iâ€™m painting human beings, theyâ€™re in all the paintings Iâ€™m doing, because for the first time perhaps, at the age of 40, Iâ€™m feeling myself starting to belong in the world, that is, the world in its total stage, not just human beings and animals but all being one.",

Born in Dubbo, Riley moved to Sydney in the late 1970s, setting aside his carpentry apprenticeship in 1982 and taking photography courses at Sydney University's Tin Sheds Gallery and the Sydney College of the Arts. Riley and his work became integral to the emerging movement of Indigenous artists working in photography and new media. He was one of the co-founders of the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative in 1987 and exhibited in the groundbreaking Indigenous art exhibitions _Koori Art '84_ at Artspace and _NADOC '86 Exhibition of Aboriginal and Islander Photographers_ at the Aboriginal Artists Gallery. He also worked at Film Australia, where he wrote and directed his first film _Boomalli: Five Artists_ (1988). His first solo exhibition, _Portraits by a Window_, was held at Hogarth Galleries in 1990. In 1991, he achieved international success with his photographs of his mother's Kamilaroi family in Moree, where he grew up. These were echoed in his 1999 series, which centred on his father's Wiradjuri family in Dubbo. His last photographic series, _Cloud_ (2000), was included in the Fourth Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art at the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane and the 2003 Festival of Sydney. His achievements were celebrated in the National Gallery of Australia's 2006 retrospective, _Michael Riley: Sights Unseen_, which toured around Australia. In 2014, the National Portrait Gallery displayed fifteen of Riley's black-and-white photographic portraits, made between 1984 and 1990, representing the vibrant urban-based Indigenous arts community in Sydney."

                    "content": "William Robinson AO (b. 1936) is one of Australia's most distinguished and influential contemporary painters, known for his distinctive and prolific output as landscape painter in particular. Born and raised in Brisbane, he trained as a teacher and studied art at the Central Technical College (now Queensland University of Technology) in the 1950s, after which he began a distinguished career as a tertiary art educator in Brisbane and Toowoomba (including at QUT). His painting practice continued alongside his teaching work, and he held his first solo exhibitions in Brisbane in the late 1960s. During the 1970s, following his move with his wife Shirley to a small farm outside Brisbane, he began creating works which were inspired by Bonnard and documented his surroundings, the interiors of his home and the day-to-day life of his growing family. When they moved to a bigger property at Beechmont in the Gold Coast hinterland, he began painting farmyard scenes â€“ witty, merry pictures in which cows, goats, chickens and other animals cavort across the picture plane, often with minimal acknowledgement of realism or perspective. He included self portraits and portraits of Shirley in many of these works. 'Every place that we've ever lived has really affected my work', Robinson has stated. 'My work is a total reflection of my life, and these places have sometimes been difficult but they have been of extreme importance because they have given me an individuality â€¦ rather than a recipe which must be followed, or fashion or anything like that. I abhor fashion: I could never become a fashion model and nor could I become a fashionable painter, because I just do what I am.' The move to Beechmont also initiated Robinson's engagement with the landscape, which he likewise began rendering in swirling, increasingly Romantic compositions that dispense with conventional viewpoints, incorporating multiple perspectives instead. Skies, rivers, rainforests and ranges contort and are upended; night and day, summer and winter coincide; trees grow sideways or upside-down; stars collide with the forest canopy and vice-versa. During the same period, Robinson entered the Archibald Prize for the first time with _William and Josephine_ (1984) â€“ a self-portrait with one of his favourite cows. Robinson won the Prize for the first time in 1987 with _Equestrian self portrait_; his second Archibald win came in 1995 with _Self portrait with stunned mullet_ â€“ his final Archibald entry.\\n\\nArt critic John McDonald has written that Robinson 'is the only non-Aboriginal artist since Fred Williams and John Olsen to give us an entirely new view of the Australian landscape.' Twice winner of the Wynne Prize (in 1990 and 1996), Robinson's name has become synonymous with swooping, grand and all-encompassing pictures of gnarled rainforests and deep green mountain ranges, dizzying views of the heavens, and paintings evoking the creation. His work is represented in in each of the major Australian public art museums as well as in prestigious international collections such as those of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the British Museum, London. In 2011, Robinson donated works valued at almost $5 million to the Queensland University of Technology in honour of his longstanding association with the institution as a student and educator. The gift included both of his Archibald-winning self portraits and now forms the basis of the William Robinson Gallery, situated on QUT's Gardens Point campus in Old Government House. Robinson has held numerous solo exhibitions since the late 1960s and his work has been included in a similar number of prestigious group exhibitions. He has represented Australia at the Venice Biennale (in 1990), and the retrospectives of his work â€“ _William Robinson: the revelation of lands_cape (SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney, 2003) and _Darkness and Light: the art of William Robinson_ (QAG, 2001) have toured to venues across the country. Robinson's official honours include an AO, awarded in 2007, and three honorary doctorates."

                    "content": "David Rosetzky (b. 1970) is a Melbourne-based contemporary artist working across photography, video and installation. His black-and-white photographs and double exposures often allude to different psychological and emotional states, identity and selfhood. He is known for the elegance and aesthetic rigour of his art, which draws on the visual languages of contemporary advertising and cinema. Rosetzky has participated in many solo and group exhibitions in Australia and internationally, including _Light Moves, Contemporary Australian Video Art_ at the National Gallery of Australia (2016); _Contemporary Photography_ at the National Gallery of Victoria (2017); and the third _ICP Triennial of Photography and Video_, International Centre for Photography, New York (2009). Rosetzky was awarded the inaugural Anne Landa Art Award for Moving Image and New Media Art at the Art Gallery of NSW in 2005. In 2014 the Centre for Contemporary Photography curated the survey exhibition _True Self: David Rosetzky Selected Works_, which toured nationally. His commissions for the Portrait Gallery include a 2008 digital video portrait of Cate Blanchett and a 2018 photograph of Jessica Mauboy. Rosetzky's subsequent projects include _Composite Acts_ (2019), commissioned by Channels International Biennial of Video Art, Melbourne and _Being Ourselves_ (2020) at Monash Gallery of Art, Melbourne. His work is held in regional and state gallery collections across Australia."

                    "content": "Marilyn Rowe AM OBE (b. 1946), former prima ballerina, was the first graduate of The Australian Ballet School to become its director. Born in Sydney, Rowe was one of 23 students in the first intake of The Australian Ballet School in 1964. At that time, Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn were guesting with The Australian Ballet, which had formed in 1962. Dame Peggy van Praagh invited Rowe to join the company at the end of 1964 and she was promoted to principal artist in 1969. Four years later, she and Kelvin Coe won silver medals at the Second International Ballet Competition in Moscow. Rowe danced all of the major roles in The Australian Ballet's repertoire and had several works created for her by leading international choreographers, including _Gemini_ (Glen Tetley), _The Merry Widow_ (Ronald Hynd) and _Anna Karenina_ (AndrÃ© Prokovsky). She and Coe performed in New York and London, and became the first Australians to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi, Riga and Vilnius ballet companies. At the end of 1980, while pregnant, Rowe's husband Christopher Maver died in a plane crash. She went into seclusion, but when her son was six months old, in response to demands from the dancers, she returned to the company as an adviser to the artistic director. In 1982 and 1985 she received the Green Room Award for Best Female Dancer. Director of the Dancers' Company from 1984 to 1986, she was on the board of The Australian Ballet from 1994 to 2009, and was Director of The Australian Ballet School from 1999 to 2014. Rowe has produced and directed major contemporary and classical works and received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Australian Dance Awards in 2015."

                    "content": "Jenny Sages (b. 1933), artist, was born to Russian Jewish parents in Shanghai and came to Australia with her family in 1948. After cursory art studies at East Sydney Technical College she attended Franklin School of Art, New York. Having returned to Sydney and married Jack Sages, between 1955 and 1984 she worked as a freelance illustrator and travel writer for books and fashion magazines including _Vogue Australia_. Following a trip to the Kimberley in 1983, Sages decided to become a full-time artist, concentrating on portraits, abstract and landscape works. A specialist in the medium of encaustic wax, delicately coloured with powdered pigments, since 1985 she has worked in a studio atop her home in Carlotta Road, Double Bay; she has had regular solo exhibitions since 1988. Her portrait of Emily Kngwarreye, the first work purchased for the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in 1998, was painted following her annual trips to Central Australia. From 2010 to 2013 an expanded iteration of the National Portrait Gallery exhibition _Jenny Sages: Paths to Portraiture_ toured to Tweed, Toowoomba, Mackay, Burnie and Mosman. Sages won the Portia Geach Award in 1992 and 1994 and the Wynne Prize in 2005, and has been a finalist for the Archibald Prize twenty times (1990, 1993â€“2009, 2011â€“2012); her 2000 and 2001 Archibald Prize entries were highly commended by the Trustees and the affecting self-portrait of the artist in widowhood, _After Jack_, was People's Choice in 2012. She last entered the Prize in 2013 with a portrait of Sarah Engledow, which was hung in the Salon des RefusÃ©s. The National Portrait Gallery has her portraits of Emily Kngwarreye, Helen Garner, Kate Grenville, Irina Baronova, and Nancy Borlase and Laurie Short. Her solo exhibition, _Lest I forget_, showed at her long-term gallery, King Street Gallery on William, in 2018."

Ten years later, having exhibited at various venues, she had her first solo exhibition with King Street Gallery, where she has shown ever since. To date, she has held 57 solo shows. She won the Sulman Prize in 1986, and the same year was awarded a residency at the CitÃ©, Paris; in 1989 she won the Mercedes Benz Scholarship to travel to the Middle East and Italy. Between 1990 and 1999 she won the Waverley Art Prize, the Robert Le Gay Brereton Drawing Prize, the Portia Geach Prize, the Kedumba Drawing Prize, the Bathurst Art Prize and the Archibald Prize; she won the Portia Geach Prize again in 2003 and gained another residency at the CitÃ© in 2006. Meanwhile, in 1998-1999 the City of Sydney commissioned her to paint eight enormous murals for at the Olympic Pool at the Cook and Phillip Aquatic Centre and the Australian War Memorial appointed her as an Official Artist attached to the Australian Army History Unit in Dili, East Timor. Her more recent residencies and associations have included one at Taronga Zoo in 2011, one in Antarctica in 2012, one with Circus Oz in 2015-2016 and one at the State Library of New South Wales in 2018. Renowned for her richly-coloured, carnivalesque and variously-perspectived works, she is particularly interested in the curvaceous, voluptuous forms of dancers, acrobats, drag artists and burlesque performers and the effects of stage, street and domestic lighting. The book _Wendy Sharpe_ was published in 2011 to coincide with the artist's retrospective exhibition, _Wendy Sharpe: The imagined life_ at the SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney.With more than 1500 dedicated Facebook followers, Sharpe divides her years between Sydney and Paris, where she has homes and studios."

                    "content": "Jiawei Shen (b. 1948), artist, was born in China in 1948 and began to gain recognition as a painter during the Cultural Revolution. Largely self-taught at first, he eventually studied at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, where he became strongly influenced by his teacher Shangyi, Chinaâ€™s most famous portraitist. Shen became a specialist in history paintings, many of which he produced for public collections. One picture, however â€“ a depiction of heroes of the Chinese nationalist movement â€“ necessitated his departure from China in 1989. His wife, artist Lan Wang, was pregnant when he left; it was two years before they were reunited in Sydney, where Shen met their daughter Xini for the first time. Having started out making sketches of passers-by at Darling Harbour, Shen is now a much sought-after portraitist, a regular Archibald finalist and has created work for clients such as the Vatican and Parliament House. He has painted commissions of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Tom Hughes KC and L Gordon Darling AC CMG for the National Portrait Gallery. 'There are two sides to my work,' he explains. 'When I came here I was nothing â€¦ so any commission was very exciting. But for a long time now, I've been interested in making paintings that show the big things: the world, history, great men.' To make a picture such as _The Third World_ 2002, depicting 92 identifiable contemporary and historical figures, he spends months in the library, as well as in his studio. He has no plans to return to China, commenting that â€˜When I go back I see the worst of communism and the worst of capitalism.' Shen and Wang both live and work in Bundeena, south of Sydney."

                    "content": "Arnold Shore, a lifelong inhabitant of Melbourne, was apprenticed to a stained glass and leadlight company called Brooks, Robinson soon after leaving school at the age of twelve. He worked there for more than twenty years, and there, he met his lifelong friend, artist Jock Frater. For five years before World War 1 he trained at the NGV School under Frederick McCubbin, but left before completing his qualifications, transferring to the tuition of Max Meldrum until 1923. Meanwhile, he read up on modern European art when he got the chance. Over the 1930s he developed a reputation for flower studies before turning to the bush, which became a favourite subject. He exhibited with the Twenty Melbourne Paintersâ€™ Society, a breakaway group from the dominant Victorian Artistsâ€™ Society, from 1923 to 1946. In 1932, with the older and wealthier George Bell, an established art critic, he founded the Bell-Shore School. Bell had been classically trained; as Shore put it, â€˜Bellâ€™s training and experience was balanced by my enthusiasm and sense of art . . . He generally trusted to logic. I depended on feeling.â€™ The school quickly became an important influence on the development of Melbourne modernism but tensions developed between the founders and the partnership dissolved in 1936. In 1935 HV â€˜Docâ€™ Evatt and his wife Mary Alice gave Shore his first portrait commission (amongst the first works acquired for the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in 1998). The National Gallery of Victoria first purchased one of Shoreâ€™s works in 1937, and for some years he gave annual lectures there about modern art. From that time, his works were purchased by state galleries in Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney, and he also found himself increasingly teaching, lecturing, critical reviewing and judging art prizes. He won the Crouch prize in 1938. Shoreâ€™s career was at its high through much of the 1940s, when he lived at Mount Macedon and painted rich and distinctive views of the bush. By the spring of 1949 he had had six solo shows in Melbourne, the National Gallery of Victoria had five of his works and the Art Gallery of Western Australia had bought one of his paintings. In the 1950s, however, he painted very little. Throughout his life the artist endured periods of suicidal depression and anxiety, which were addressed with shock treatment and the prototype medications of the day. Shore was art critic for the _Argus_ and the _Age_. In 1957, Tam and Anne Purves held the first major retrospective of his works â€“ nearly a hundred of them - at their new Australian Galleries; both Alan McCullough and John Brack declared his significance. In 1960 and 1961 he was president of the Victorian Artistsâ€™ Society, which awarded him its medal of honour. In 1962 he was one of six Australian painters represented in a touring exhibition through Victoria, curated by James Mollison for the National Gallery of Victoria. However, by that time, the Angry Penguins were the fashionable artists of the day. Estranged from his wife and having to sell assets to afford a home, he plunged into melancholy that waxed and waned until he died of natural causes in the autumn of 1963. Shore is represented in all major Australian galleries. Much of this information is taken from _Arnold Shore: Pioneer Modernist_ by Rob Haysom."

I might be going to a shop to buy something to eat or to get a drink, or I might be going to meet somebody. But as a painter youâ€™re always looking at things, a big percentage of your time anyway, if not always, youâ€™re looking at things with a painterâ€™s eye. Youâ€™re noticing the colours and the shapes and the textures that you see about you. You also â€“ youâ€™re not lacking in humanity â€“ you also notice people, that people look sad or sick or happy and so on, when you see them. You see a drunk and you step out of his way if you think heâ€™s going to be pugnacious, and so on, or you laugh at him if heâ€™s just happy. But as a painter you look for these colours and these shapes, and youâ€™re thinking of your job. It might sound awful to talk about painting as a job, but it is a job just like anything else.\\n\\nAnd another thing, Iâ€™m breaking in on myself, but I believe that a cricketer or a footballer or a golf player, that they are when theyâ€™re at the best, that theyâ€™re in the same position as the artist; theyâ€™re using their knowledge and their skill and their feeling to do something. There is a difference: the golfer when he dies, heâ€™s dead except in the memory of people who remember that he won a certain competition or that he put up some record round, but he doesnâ€™t leave anything behind him except that. The artist if heâ€™s lucky, and the worldâ€™s lucky, does leave things behind him and thereâ€™s a peculiar quality about a work of art, is that once itâ€™s created by a man who combines knowledge and feeling â€“ it doesnâ€™t matter whether heâ€™s a primitive, a caveman, an Aboriginal artist in the bush, or a painter in a studio in one of the great cities of the world, a Rembrandt or a Velasquez â€“ once they create a work of art that really is a work of art, it never loses its quality. Art doesnâ€™t progress; it changes.\\n\\nÂ ",

He arrived in Australia from England in 1948 at fifteen, having studied at the Gravesend School of Art in Kent. Associated with artist Jon Molvig, he became a key member of the Brisbane School and held his first exhibition in 1960. In 1961, he exhibited at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. The following year his work was included in an exhibition at the Tate Gallery and he won the Transfield Art Prize, then Australia's richest art award. In the 1960s and 1970s his work was included in exhibitions in Japan, USA, Paris and Germany. Sibley moved to Melbourne in 1966 and was a lecturer in Fine Arts at RMIT until 1990, when he became Head of Painting at Monash University. Throughout his career he exhibited regularly and is represented in most major Australian galleries. His portraits of Molvig, Mirka Mora and Alan McCulloch were finalists in the Archibald Prize, and he was a finalist in the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize with his works of his wife Irene Sibley and Rodney Hall. Drawing was an essential part of Sibley's practice, and the National Portrait Gallery has eighteen of the artist's portraits in pencil and ink."

                    "content": "Joshua Smith studied sculpture with Rayner Hoff and took classes in drawing and painting at Julian Ashton's Sydney Art School. During the war, Smith worked in a camouflage unit with fellow artist William Dobell. In January 1944 Dobell's portrait of Smith was awarded the Archibald Prize for 1943. A law case ensued, with the artist complainants alleging that Dobell's work was a caricature of his friend. The court found that it was a good likeness. The trial was inevitably distracting, embarrassing and debilitating for Dobell and Smith, but the following year Smith rallied to win the Archibald himself, for a portrait of HS Rosevear. Dobell's portrait of Smith was badly damaged in a fire in 1958, but it has since been restored. Smith painted several memorable portraits, including one of Dame Mary Gilmore and a haunting study of his parents acquired by the Art Gallery of NSW in 1943. He was a regular exhibitor in the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes for many years."

If I remember correctly, I asked for about 15 sittings. Being the first official portrait that Iâ€™d been given from the Government I was rather a bit scared, you know. Anyway, Mr Rosevear was very co-operative, and it eventually won the Archibald, so, quite good!\\n\\nNow with my own procedure as regards portrait painting, that has varied considerably over the years. At one stage, I used to make a small drawing, say about 15 inches deep, in pencil, and more in the nature of a very accurate map, and then work from that; but later I found that I prefer to draw straight onto the canvas with charcoal, just dust that off and then paint direct. And I also like to have my sitter in front of me the whole time.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™ve been asked to say something about Chips Raffertyâ€™s portrait and how I did it. Well that was painted out in the open in the lawn in his backyard. I had a good many sittings. I remember Chips saying to me, â€˜Youâ€™ve worn a track across my lawn, running backwards and forwards!â€™. I like to have my canvas right alongside my subject and get back from it to make my observations as far as possible.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™ve been asked about any particular highlights in my life. Well, I think one of the most important things that I can remember is my first sale of a drawing. And it was a little drawing of my mother, a pencil drawing of my mother playing the piano. And we had it in the Julian Ashton School sketch club. And I was sitting next to the late Julian Ashton and Julian turned to me and said, â€˜Would you take half a guinea for it?â€™. I said â€˜Sold!â€™.",

After the war, he recommenced study at RMIT under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Training Scheme. Smith and his wife Joy moved to Sydney in 1952, and he found work as a window cleaner at David Jonesâ€™s. When he won his first Blake Prize for religious art in 1956, the _Sun_ reported that â€˜window cleaner Eric Smith took only an hour to paint the Scourged Christ.â€™ Characterised as a â€˜battlerâ€™, he initially painted in the bedroom he and Joy shared. In 1958 he, Joy and their children moved to Small St, Woollahra. Smith was to win the Blake prize five more times up to 1970. Notable for experimenting with diverse art styles, he also won the Wynne Prize twice, and the Sulman Prize in 1953, 1973 and 2003. In 1963, when he was in London to see his work hung in the Tate exhibition of Australian art, he received the Helena Rubinstein Art Award. \\n\\nEric Smith first entered the Archibald Prize with a strong self-portrait in 1944. He won the Prize in 1970, 1981 and 1982 with portraits of architect Neville Gruzman, art dealer Rudi Komon and composer Peter Sculthorpe respectively. The prize for the portrait of Komon survived a challenge from an artist whoâ€™d been stripped of the Archibald five years earlier for painting from a photograph. Smith acknowledged that he used photographs, but he also knew Komon, and had had multiple sittings with him. Smithâ€™s paintings are in the collections of the National Gallery, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Queensland Art Gallery. Working almost until his death, he was the subject of a television documentary, _Not Finished Yet_, in 2012."

Some painters do a great many drawings before they tackle the major work, but I usually go straight to the canvas or the Masonite panel. I have no real reason; I cannot explain why it seems necessary for me to get straight to the board, but Iâ€™ve always found it so. Iâ€™ve many times said to myself that I was going to do a lot of drawings, but I no sooner start than I move across to the prepared board.\\n\\nSometimes I have a particular subject in mind, religious or otherwise, but most often than not I just start painting. This seems necessary for me, to just let the thing grow, to really try and find out about myself, let the thing happen, and as the forms appear on the canvas they suggest something to me, something perhaps to do with a subject matter, and if the forms seem dynamic enough, things are working and exciting level and I push that thing on to a particular subject matter.\\n\\nIt is so hard today, we have nothing to hang our hat onto, and itâ€™s a case of really digging down deep to find out about yourself. You take a risk here that you wonâ€™t be understood.\\n\\nI have always been concerned with the human condition, whether the tragedy or aspirations of man. And everywhere new relationships are springing up which must be felt and explored, and in this way, I must create my own language to express the depth of my feelings about these things.",

Becoming interested in women's issues in her twenties, in the interwar years she intervened in unemployment relief, the plight of Jewish refugees, and Indigenous rights. She stood unsuccessfully as a Labor Party candidate in the federal elections of 1939 and 1946; in between, in 1945, she was the sole Australian woman delegate to the founding of the United Nations, where she pressed for women's rights. Street first visited Russia in 1938, and was president of the Australian Russian Society from 1946; as the Cold War developed, she was (falsely) accused of communist sympathies. In 1949, expelled from the Labor party, she stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate. Street's husband, Sir Kenneth Street, was Chief Justice of NSW from 1950, and for much of the 1950s she worked for the World Peace Council in London. Her son, Laurence, became Chief Justice of New South Wales in 1974."

After all, the trade union movement is supposed to represent both the men and the women in jobs. There must be amongst their membership, the same number of intelligent women as there are intelligent men. And I would very much hope to see in the future â€“ I donâ€™t suppose itâ€™ll come in my lifetime â€“ that they have the proper distribution of places of influence between men and women both in the governing bodies of unions, and also, later on, when things gets more socialistic, in the governing body of the industries themselves.\\n\\nNow I say, â€˜get more socialisticâ€™, there because many years ago I became a socialist. I read quite a lot of books about politics and so on and so forth, and it seemed to me to be the system under which the individual, whether a man or a woman, had the greatest opportunity of developing their usefulness and status. You only have to look back in history in the days of serfdom and all the rest of it. Itâ€™s as theyâ€™ve gradually overcome the limitations that were placed on them by the social system, that not only women have advanced but society itself has advanced. And of course, if you come to think of it, men and women are both components of society and if you have a horse with a lame foot or a shackled foot itâ€™s not going to gallop was well as one that hasnâ€™t got, who hasnâ€™t got any shackles on. And itâ€™s the same with the human race â€“ if youâ€™re going to shackle the women, as they have been in the past and to a certain extent still are, youâ€™re going to hold up the progress of the whole of our society.",

Born in Darwin, she attended dance schools in Melbourne, Penang and Sydney before being accepted into the Australian Ballet School in 1973. After joining the Australian Ballet in 1975, she then worked as a soloist with Pina Bausch's dance theatre in Wuppertal, Germany between 1978 and 1984. As a freelance choreographer, she established her distinctive choreography in works such as _Two Feet_ (1988) and was commissioned for projects in France, the Netherlands and Germany. For three years from 1989 she was artistic director of Canberra's Meryl Tankard Company, followed by six years as artistic director of Adelaide's Australian Dance Theatre, later renamed the Meryl Tankard Australian Dance Theatre. Tankard's defining work in this period was _Furioso_, featuring aerial choreography. With composer Elena Kats Chernin, she created the full-length ballet _Wild Swans_ for the Australian Ballet in 2003. The _Oracle_ (2009), a revisioning of the _Rite of Spring_ for Australian dancer Paul White, won the Australian Dance Award for Outstanding Choreography in 2010 and toured internationally. Since graduating from the Australian Film, Television and Radio School in 2010, Tankard has made several films including the award-winning documentary _Michelle's Story_ (2015). She continues to create dance productions, including recreating _Two Feet_ for the 2019 Adelaide Festival and choreographing _Claudel_ for the Sydney Opera House in 2021."

She began training with the great Russian teacher Olga Preobrajenska, formerly of the Imperial Russian Ballet, at age ten after her family emigrated to Paris from Bessarabia, Romania. Noticed by choreographer George Balachine, at seventeen she joined the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. Tchinarova came to Australia on the first and second tours of the Russian ballets in 1936 and 1938, and chose to remain in Sydney after the second tour. In 1943 she married the actor Peter Finch, who had recently made his film debut in _Dad and Dave Come to Town_. During the 1940s she danced with three Australian dance companies, the Kirsova Ballet, the Polish-Australian Ballet and the Borovansky Ballet. In 1948, Finch and Tchinarova moved to London before divorcing in 1959. She then began working as a Russian/English interpreter for touring ballet companies, including the Australian Ballet, and as a dance writer. Tchinarova came back to Australia for the last time in 1994 as a guest of The Australian Ballet, delivering a series of lectures. Her autobiography, _Dancing into the Unknown: My Life in the Ballets Russes and Beyond_, was published in 2007. She died ten years later in Marbella, Spain at the age of 98."

He started swimming at age five and was fourteen when he made the Australian squad for the 1997 Pan Pacific Games. At the World Championships six months later, Thorpe was victorious in the final of the men's 400 m freestyle, making him swimming's youngest ever men's world champion. He won four gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. Thorpe's first Olympic campaign, in Sydney, resulted in three gold and two silver medals and three world records. His haul for 2001 and 2002 included wins in six events at the world championships; six gold medals at the Manchester Commonwealth Games; and another world record. In claiming the 400 m freestyle world title in 2003, he became the first swimmer to win the same event at three consecutive world championships. His two gold medals at the 2004 Athens Olympics came from victories in the 400 m and 200 m freestyle, the final of the latter event pitting him against American Michael Phelps in what some pundits dubbed swimming's 'race of the century'. After retiring in 2006, he had a brief comeback to competitive swimming in 2012 and released his autobiography _This Is Me_. Thorpe has been open about his mental health issues as an elite athlete and is chair of the Australian Institute of Sport's Athlete Wellbeing Advisory Committee. He has two honorary doctorates, an Order of Australia and the Human Rights Medal, acknowledging his advocacy in Indigenous education, marriage equality and mental health."

She painted portraits from 1924; during three years' travel studies from 1926 she attended the AcadÃ©mie Julian in Paris, and spent some time under Augustus John in the south of France. A long-term resident of Mosman, Toovey frequently exhibited landscapes in the Wynne Prize, and she was an Archibald finalist thirty-four times though she never won the Prize. She won the Portia Geach Memorial Award in 1970 with a self-portrait in a landscape, and 1978 with a portrait of Neville Bonner. The Art Gallery of New South Wales has a landscape, the 1970 self-portrait, and her portrait of Roy Fluke (1961)."

His expressionistic style of painting was formed during the wartime years, when the city of Melbourne took on a strange and unreal atmosphere. His first major series of paintings, collectively titled Images of Modern Evil, was painted between 1945 and 1947. Tucker lived in Europe and the United States throughout the 1950s. There he refined and extended his subjects, concentrating on Australian myths, which he saw as central to the definition of national identity. Although best known as a painter, Tucker was an enthusiastic photographer. He took many of the now-familiar photographs of Melbourne's artistic circles of the 1940s."

I think itâ€™s answering an inner compulsion, because if I didnâ€™t find this particular form of activity â€“ to me itâ€™s one that is defining things to myself and defining myself â€“ Iâ€™m not quite sure what would happen to me if I didnâ€™t answer this kind of inner compulsion. And I suppose it relates to oneâ€™s attitude to life. I think that, despite all the negative and destructive powers that are constantly at work with us, that one is constantly striving to affirm life, to be in love with it, and these are the tokens of affection on our way, as it were.\\n\\nThe question of why I paint the particular things I do is also pretty ambiguous. I think I would say that Iâ€™m trying to exorcise my own particular devils, and I suppose some of them get into the painting. I hope they do, thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m trying to put them, and get rid of them.\\n\\nBut once out, of course, one can then feel this kind of relaxation, the affirmation flows in, and the devils in the painting can sometimes turn into angels.\\n\\nI suppose in the act of work that it is essentially a struggle to escape the enmeshment of oneâ€™s ego, and in the attempt to struggle free one seems externally, to the external world, to be a very egocentric person, because youâ€™re following a necessary compulsion without which one loses oneâ€™s own balance and direction in life; and in the act of working one is defining these shapes, ejecting them as it were, and getting rid of them; and this process of ejectment is one there which is defining and clarifying oneâ€™s own particular kind of energy which you are attempting to flow out into life.",

In 1975 she photographed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam handing back the land to Vincent Lingiari at Wattie Creek in the Northern Territory to celebrate the first successful Aboriginal land claim. In 1980, after several years living and working closely with Aboriginal families and communities in Arnhem Land, National Geographic magazine published her story on their enduring traditional culture and customs, which she followed with a book 'This is my Country: A View of Arnhem Land', in 1985. Tweedie's book, _Spirit of Arnhem Land_, was published to international acclaim, photographs from which won the Walkley award for feature photography in 1999. Tweedie worked on assignments for major magazines and publications including National Geographic, Newsweek, Time Magazine and the Sunday Times, and non-goverment organisations such as Save the Children and Oxfam. Assignments took the photographer to over sixty countries where she photographed war, famine, historical and political events, and people and the environment."

She has won a number of awards including the 1999 City of Hobart Art Prize for ceramics, and an Arts SA Project Grant in 2000, when she spent some time as Artist in Residence at the Jam Factory. Over the past decade she collaborated with her husband, Hossein Valamanesh (1949-2022), on public art projects including _An Gorta Mor_, the Great Irish Famine Memorial at the Hyde Park Barracks (1999). In the same period, her solo work has tended toward installations of a delicate, wry and disconcerting nature.

Adopted when he was five weeks old, he reconnected with his biological mother and siblings in 2004. That year he suffered depression and reached out to Beyond Blue, for which he is now an ambassador. After joining Little Athletics as a child, Vander-Kuyp turned to hurdles at age ten. In 1995 he set a new Australian record for the 110 m hurdles, 13.29 seconds, a record that still stands. He represented Australia at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics (where he was a finalist) and in Sydney in 2000, where he made the semi-finals, as well as four world championships. In 2004 he won his eleventh consecutive national title in the event â€“ injury prevented him from defending the title again in 2005. At the 2006 national titles he was again the fastest Australian in the event, running a time that saw him selected to compete in his fourth Commonwealth Games. He was the recipient of the Dr. Charles Perkins Award, the 2004 Deadly's Award for outstanding contribution to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Sports and in 2005 named Athlete's Athlete at the Telstra Athlete of the Year Awards. Following his retirement, Vander-Kuyp has been a spokesperson for Indigenous people, working as a program manager for the Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience and an Indigenous Mentor for AFL SportsReady. He is on the board of Grow Hope, a foundation that empowers First Nations youth to pass on their culture to fellow Australians. In 2017 he joined the Schiavello Group as Indigenous Engagement Manager, where he helps to increase Indigenous employment and participation in the construction sector."

In 1976, the couple was appointed to lead the Dance Company New South Wales (later the Sydney Dance Company) and they put together their first production, Poppy. Throughout their careers she has been Murphyâ€™s muse and collaborator, able to see the full sweep of a production and ensure its parts worked together while he concentrated on details. In the early years they often danced together; later, she danced with the company throughout the world, in roles and productions they had created together. In 1996 she was named amongst Australiaâ€™s top five female dancers of all time (along with Marillyn Jones, Marilyn Rowe, Kathleen Gorham and Lucette Aldous). In 2000 Murphy and Vernon celebrated their achievements in Body of Work: A retrospective. Two years later they put together a unique Swan Lake. They married in 2004, and in 2009 choreographed the film Maoâ€™s Last Dancer. Vernon and Murphy retired from the Sydney Dance Company in 2007 but the couple has continued to create works for Chinese, German and Australian companies."

                    "content": "John Vickery (1906-1983), illustrator, designer and painter was the only Australian to be part of the New York School in 1960s which includes painters such as Jackson Pollock, Joan Mitchell and Willem de Kooning. Vickery was an important painter in Australia's engagement with the Op Art movement.\\n\\nA student at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, the artist had good success as a portrait artist early in his career. A finalist in the Archibald Prize three times: in 1932 with a portrait of Miss Leila Pirani, and twice in 1933 with his self portrait, and a portrait of Miss Joan Burbury. After a brief stay in London, he moved to the United States of America in the 1930s, where he pursued his arts practice while working in advertising in New York, as an illustrator. From 1943 through to the end of the Second World War, he sketched the portraits of more than 650 patients in military hospitals in the US and the South West Pacific, as part of the USO. Vickery's contribution continued after the end of the war, as Chairman of group counselling for The Society of Illustrators Veterans' Program, supporting upskilling, education, and reengagement.\\n\\nBy the 1950s, Vickery had become friends with Philip Guston and come into contact with other members of the expressionist New York School, including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Yves Kline. Despite his proven capacity as a fine portrait artist, Vickery primarily worked in Op Art, and named the New York School as a significant influence. He exhibited regularly in the US over the course of his career, and three decades after his death, his contribution was recognised at his alma mater: an exhibition of his work was the inaugural show at the Victorian College of the Arts' Founders Gallery in 2013. Vickery's work is represented in the collections of the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia, Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TÄmaki. The University of Melbourne offers the John Vickery Scholarship for Art students enrolled in Painting or Drawing, based on financial need and academic achievement."

                    "content": "Wes Walters (1928-2014), painter, studied architecture in Geelong and art at the Ballarat School of Mines before embarking on a successful career as a freelance commercial artist in 1950. In 1963 he was won the Australian Commercial and Industrial Artists' Association's Award of Distinctive Merit, and thirty years later he was inducted into the Illustrators' Hall of Fame. In the 1970s Walters moved away from full time advertising work to concentrate on painting, holding solo shows of landscapes and photorealist nudes. Gradually he developed a specialisation in portraiture, undertaking many commissions. When he won the Archibald Prize in 1979 for a portrait of Phillip Adams - pipping Keith Looby's portrait of Padraic McGuinness - Adams predicted correctly that the 'arties' would be furious because of Walters's background in commercial art. Walters has stated that 'My main objective as a portrait painter is to paint as well as my hero, Velasquez, in my estimation by far the world's greatest portraitist. I feel this is unlikely to be brought to fruition, although sometimes there are instances when I feel I get a little closer.' The National Portrait Gallery acquired his painting of Sir Zelman Cowen PC AK GCMG GCVO QC DCL by gift of Joseph Brown and Marc Besen AO in 2000. In 2006, also by gift from Joseph Brown, the Gallery acquired Waltersâ€™s undated portrait of Arthur Boyd."

Having studied at the Queensland College of Art, Watson moved to Melbourne, where he held his first solo show at the Acland Street Gallery in 1984. Since then has only worked as a painter - although he did paint trompe l'oeuil murals for Harrods for a time. He has traded through his own Ross Watson Gallery in North Carlton since 2000. Between 1996 and 2001 Watson produced a series of posed figure studies of a barely-clad Ian Roberts in lurid studio settings. The portrait of Mitcham is from a series titled Classic de Novo II, which includes paintings featuring Kylie Minogue's backing dancer Marco Da Silva; Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears; hardcore adult film stars Alex Baresi and FranÃ§ois Sagat; and retired High Court judge Michael Kirby. Watson's work is represented in the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and many private collections, notably that of Sir Elton John, whose early support encouraged the artist. The National Portrait Gallery acquired Waton's portrait of Ian Roberts after the French baroque painter Coypel, from a series titled Galerie des Glaces, in 2004."

Largely self-taught, Westwood did not start painting professionally until his mid thirties and held his first exhibition in 1967. Prior to this he had an eclectic career in economics, advertising and the film industry. His decision to pursue an artistic vocation was prompted by a friendship with Jeffrey Smart and Justin O'Brien, with whom he had some lessons. His work was characterised by a dispassionate scrutiny of objects and a mannerly approach in their portrayal. Like fellow painter and friend, Margaret Olley (who sat for him on a number of occasions) he emphasised craft, conscientiousness and respect for tradition in his practice. His portraiture has been described as photorealist. He was the official artist appointed by the Federal Government to the 75th Anniversary of the Gallipoli landings in 1990, travelling with the veterans. The resulting paintings and sketches were exhibited at the Australian War Memorial. Westwood's work is represented in State and University collections throughout Australia and in the National Gallery of Australia, as well as in a number of corporate collections. His portraits of Prime Ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Fraser are currently on loan to the National Portrait Gallery and are on display in Kings Hall."

                    "content": "Brett Whiteley AO, artist, displayed a brilliant talent for drawing as a Sydney private schoolboy. After studying half-heartedly at art school he travelled to Europe on a scholarship. In London he excited art dealers and fell under the influence of painters such as Francis Bacon. He won the international prize at the second Paris Biennale for Young Artists in 1961, and married his beautiful muse, Wendy Julius, the following year. Through the 1960s he exhibited around the world before returning to live on the Sydney harbourside. He began the 1970s with gentle pictures of birds, moving on to massive portraits of the poets Verlaine and Rimbaud before taking two years to paint the eighteen-panel Alchemy 1972-1973. He then turned to series of paintings of waves, interiors, the harbour, and coastal landscapes. In 1978, his annus mirabilis, he became the first artist to win the Archibald Prize for portraiture, the Wynne Prize for landscape and the Sulman Prize for genre painting all in the same year. He died of an overdose in a motel in Thirroul, New South Wales in the winter of 1992."

                    "transcript": "Itâ€™s impossible to talk about art because Iâ€™ve always taken it for granted. Iâ€™ve always understood, basically, that I used to be something else, that Iâ€™m a continuation of a particular kind of thread of human spirit, that the only thing that Iâ€™m involved in is the notion of interpreting time, in a sense that Iâ€™m alive. That the spirit will continue and itâ€™ll be the same as what it was, and various painters have given their flash at it and that in a summary is basically what Iâ€™m doing. Along with that, is like, the immense sense of the requirement towards survival so one gets more interested in the capacity for power, or in the various ways that can be appropriated. And that art has to follow that, has to employ it, if itâ€™s of any value.\\n\\nThereâ€™s no such a thing as Australian art because thereâ€™s probably no such a thing as Australia. Thereâ€™s a kind of ancient piece of immense and interesting and very strange land, which has had a few people come down on it and in a very surreal way started a kind of sensual civilisation. Itâ€™s got to a kind of point where weâ€™re suffering like the rest of the world with a kind of paralysis of confidence.\\n\\nI think that humankind are trying to force and press open a new area of brain think â€“ a capacity to sense, a broader knowing. In order to do that weâ€™re going to have in Godâ€™s, or in the puzzleâ€™s term, some sort of a major reckoning up. Weâ€™ve got death absolutely in our hands, a complete capacity to bang it out, and weâ€™re trying to force open this newer channel. I see, to a certain degree, that I along with numbers of other individuals, are trying to, you know, cause inside their own pressure, that breaking through, that kind of time. I mean, thereâ€™s immense relaxation inside it, but thereâ€™s also like the heat towards want, the necessity of the mystery of life, of the system of life, which is always, like, come and go.

While still a student, she won the Le Gay Brereton Prize for Drawing; she has since participated in countless solo and group exhibitions. From 1961 to 1971 she taught at various secondary schools and colleges; from 1972 to 1978 she taught at the West Australian Institute of Technology in Perth; from 1979 to 1985 she taught at Hornsby College of TAFE. Meanwhile, from 1967 she travelled widely through remote areas of Australia and abroad. She won the Wynne Prize in 1971 and the Portia Geach Memorial Awards in both 1983 and 1984. Recipient of a number of smaller prizes, she has been an Archibald finalist seven times, several times with self-portraits, of which she has made many over the course of her career (the â€˜hornedâ€™ turban is characteristic.) The Art Gallery of New South Wales has four of her works and she is represented in a number of regional galleries. Gavin Fryâ€™s monograph _Margaret Woodward_ was published by the Beagle Press in 2003."

                    "content": "Photo media artist Anne Zahalka was born in Sydney in 1957, following her parentâ€™s migration to post-war Australia. After studying at East Sydney Technical College and Sydney College of the Arts, Zahalka began participating in group exhibitions in Australia and Germany in the early 1980s. Returning to university, she would later graduate with a Master of Fine Arts from the University of New South Wales in 1994.\\n\\nIn her practice Zahalka reconstructs recognisable imagery to explore concepts of identity, cultural and gender diversity, and the environment. Concepts of appropriation and the subversion of art historical motifs and signifiers are interwoven with the artist's restaging of historic portraiture and photography. The resulting works are intelligent, humorous and accessible. With a growing interest in ecology and the impact of humans on the environment Zahalka's 2019 series _Wild Life, Australia_ moved away from portraiture to reimagine Australian natural history dioramas; to reflect on the changing relationship between society and the natural world.\\n\\nShe has held over 40 solo exhibitions including the touring shows _Woven Threads_, _Leisureland_ and _Wild Life, Australia_. _Welcome to Sydney_ was shown in the International Terminal of Sydney Airport in 2003 and _Hall of Mirrors: Anne Zahalka Portraits_ was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery on the Canberra leg of an extensive tour in 2007. Zahalka's work was included in the international photography exhibition _Civilization: The Way We Live Now_, shown at the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, in 2018 and the National Gallery of Victoria in 2019. In the same year, the artist undertook a residency at the BÃ©hal FejÃ©r Institute in Prague, tracing her family's story of persecution, exile and survival.\\n\\nZahalka has won the Leopold Godowsky Photography Award in Boston (2005), the National Photographic Prize (2007) and the Macarthur Cook Art Prize (2008). Her work is represented in regional, state, national and international collections including the National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Art Gallery of South Australia, Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art, The National Art Gallery, New Zealand, and the Sir Elton John Collection."
