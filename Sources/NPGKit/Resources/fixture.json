In the early 1950s he became a company director with BHP, a position he held for thirty-two years. For fifteen years during this period he was also Chairman of Rheem Australia and Koitaki Ltd. His interest in the visual arts led him to accept the position of inaugural Chairman of the Board of the Australian National Gallery from 1982 to 1986. At the end of this period he established The Gordon Darling Australian Print Fund, which has acquired more than 6000 prints for the national collection to date. In 1991 he established the Gordon Darling Foundation, which provides funding and staff development opportunities for public art institutions Australia-wide. That year, too, he and his wife, Marilyn, initiated and facilitated the touring exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery. The interest generated by the exhibition led to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery. Amongst the very earliest acquisitions of the Gallery were gifts from Darling, who accepted the inaugural Board's invitation to become the Founding Patron of the Gallery in mid-1998. Since then he has enabled the acquisition of many key works for the Collection, and his support carried the Gallery to the opening of its new, dedicated home in December 2008. \\n\\nJiawei Shen (b. 1948) who painted the portrait of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark for the National Portrait Gallery in 2005, often places his sitters within evocative dreamlike or remembered settings. The backdrop of his portrait of Darling suggests the competition-winning design for the dedicated National Portrait Gallery – the project the Founding Patron long envisaged and urged. Set apart from the rest of the Collection in the Gordon Darling Hall, and seeming to capture some of the natural light of the space, his portrait hangs adjacent to the boards listing the many donors and benefactors to the institution.",

They signify her passions and personality in the same way the lives of the saints are decipherable through a language of objects in the history of art. These include peas, asparagus, peaches, quince, pomegranate and tomatoes. Beer holds her favourite flower – a yellow rose to her heart, a consciously romantic inclusion by the artist who described her impression that her sitter 'fills up a room with light and energy and generosity'. A pheasant looms large – significant as Beer's first Barossa Valley restaurant was renowned for serving locally sourced pheasant and her famous pheasant farm pate.\\n\\nThe portrait began with a single photographic sitting from which emerged a potent, imaginative and richly embellished portrait, worlds away from the artist's Sydney studio.",

By that time, they had two children; they would have three more. In 1954 a review of a group exhibition singled Smith’s work out for praise: ‘Eric Smith’s _Industrial Landscape_ compels our attention by the controlled violence of its colour, and by a mysticism that sees cathedrals in factories and crosses in telegraph poles . . Mr Smith conveys the impression that he sees these forms as a modern Golgotha – harrowing, portentous yet part of our everyday world.’ _The painter transmogrified and Mrs Smith_ hints at what it’s like for a commonsensical person to live with a co-parent who sees things this way, and is compelled to realise his vision even if it means setting up paints and easel in the bedroom. By the time he painted this work the artist had won the Blake Prize for religious art six times, and the Sulman Prize for a ‘subject painting’ or a ‘genre painting’ once. At once a painter’s exercise in different ways of portraying personality, a wry reflection on relationships, and Eric Smith’s tribute to his wife’s stability, _The painter transmogrified and Mrs Smith_ won him his second Sulman Prize.\\n\\n ****",

Some painters do a great many drawings before they tackle the major work, but I usually go straight to the canvas or the Masonite panel. I have no real reason; I cannot explain why it seems necessary for me to get straight to the board, but I’ve always found it so. I’ve many times said to myself that I was going to do a lot of drawings, but I no sooner start than I move across to the prepared board.\\n\\nSometimes I have a particular subject in mind, religious or otherwise, but most often than not I just start painting. This seems necessary for me, to just let the thing grow, to really try and find out about myself, let the thing happen, and as the forms appear on the canvas they suggest something to me, something perhaps to do with a subject matter, and if the forms seem dynamic enough, things are working and exciting level and I push that thing on to a particular subject matter.\\n\\nIt is so hard today, we have nothing to hang our hat onto, and it’s a case of really digging down deep to find out about yourself. You take a risk here that you won’t be understood.\\n\\nI have always been concerned with the human condition, whether the tragedy or aspirations of man. And everywhere new relationships are springing up which must be felt and explored, and in this way, I must create my own language to express the depth of my feelings about these things.",

Afterwards, he studied painting at RMIT and began to exhibit regularly. In 1952 he moved to Sydney, where he emerged as a key exponent of abstraction. He was later a member of the group called the Sydney Nine, whose 1961 exhibitions asserted the rigour of abstract art in the context of debates about its integrity. Smith won the Archibald Prize for a third time with this portrait of his friend Peter Sculthorpe (1929–2014), the Tasmanian-born, internationally renowned composer. Inspired by Sculthorpe's music, Smith conceived of an expressive portrait to evoke the composer's creative process and started work on the painting less than three weeks before entries closed. A day before the deadline, he made drastic changes to the work, covering everything other than Sculthorpe's figure in thick orange paint. Squares of white were 'slashed' across the canvas, creating 'sheets of music exploding into the space'. Sculthorpe had the portrait on loan for a long time before the National Portrait Gallery purchased it from Smith in 2004. 'Most portraits by other artists tended to be rather dark and expressionistic,' Sculthorpe said in 2008, 'whereas Eric's painting brings in the sun … It captures my heart, my soul, my spirit, my music, everything.'",

When I listen to music I only hear it with my heart. Of course, it goes through the ears and the brain and so on and so on, but if it moves me, well, that’s all. I don’t want to analyse it. Of course, one has to for students and so on but that’s irrelevant, I just want to soak it in. And that is all, surely, that music is about. And so everything that I write comes from my feelings or my experience of life and of living.\\n\\nIt’s getting started that is the difficulty, and almost always I get started through some, well, feeling in my heart, that sounds vague but it means something to me anyway, or something that I see, even something that I smell, but rarely anything that I hear, oddly enough. Once I’ve got started, I’m right. And I am a slow worker, but then to be a composer it’s just sheer hard work.\\n\\nYou have to forget technique or else you maybe just get beyond it, in a sense be as a kind of sieve, although I don’t believe in spiritualism, shall we say, I’ll use the word medium, in that it comes through you in some way. Because if I am being occupied with the technique, somehow the message just will not get across or the heart thing. It’s very hard to explain, and this is why I can’t really talk about method.\\n\\nI suppose I have lots of little secrets and I suppose that this is why my music always sounds like me, because it has the same faults and the same virtues, if any, whatever kind of piece it may happen to be. This is something that I try to get across to my students, they’ve just got to write and write and write until they can handle notes and juggle them about, and then just forget all about it and abandon themselves to being what they are.",

The portrait is in oil on canvas and measures about 1.5m tall by 2m wide in its frame. The frame consists of an inner white timber border and an outer border in pale peach.\\n\\nThe portrait is dominated by its vibrant orange-ochre coloured background in chalky, textured paint, with patches of saturated blue, red and yellow scattered across the canvas. \\n\\nPeter is seated at a piano on the far left, side on, his face looking to the right of the scene. Sheets of music and bright squares of colour seem to emanate from his hands and the keyboard. Peter is painted realistically, however the brushwork is uneven, as if applied quickly and spontaneously, conveying energy and movement.\\n\\nPeter is surrounded by an irregular halo of yellow paint. His thick hair, eyebrows and short moustache are dark, streaked with red, yellow and blue. His skin glows yellow and orange, highlighted with white. He wears a serious expression, dark eyes looking straight ahead at the loose pages of music, mouth closed. \\n\\nHis shirt is a bright cobalt blue, flecked with red and yellow, the collar undone and sleeves rolled up. Peter’s left elbow is bent up, parallel with his shoulder. His forearm is raised, his fingers touching the explosion of sheet music in front of him. \\n\\nThe pages are large white rectangles in different sizes, with bars and notes scratched roughly into their surfaces. Other rectangular forms in red, blue and yellow overlay and mix with them in a haphazard mass. Further rectangles splay across the right of the portrait culminating with a large red square in the top right corner of the work.  \\nPeter’s right arm is lowered, bent at the elbow, fingers stretched over the keyboard. Dashes of paint radiate from his fingertips where they connect with the piano keys.\\n\\nSeated on a piano stool, Peter’s right upper leg, in pale cream-yellow trousers, disappears beneath the keyboard. This area of the portrait, along the lower edge, is suggested with minimal outlines.\\n\\nIn the lower right portion of the portrait, in small red letters, the artist has signed: Eric Smith ‘82.\\n\\nWritten and voiced by Lucie Shawcross",

He began designing backdrops and costumes during the early 1940s, earning his first professional commission in 1947. Awarded a British Council Scholarship in 1950, he moved to London, subsequently working there and in Australia over the next four decades on more than 140 ballet, opera and theatre productions. In the 1960s, he developed a close association with The Australian Ballet, creating designs for productions including _Coppelia_ (1960), _Giselle_ (1965) and _Sleeping Beauty_ (1973). In the 1970s, he created the sets and costumes for the ballets of Peter Sculthorpe's _Sun Music_ and _Rites of Passage_, choreographed by Robert Helpmann. At the same time, Rowell developed a considerable reputation as an artist, producing expressionist paintings, mixed media works and sculpture inspired by the Australian landscape. The National Gallery of Australia holds more than 400 examples of his costume design drawings; and in 1999, Opera Australia mounted the retrospective exhibition _Double Act_.\\n\\nDavid Strachan was a Sydney painter who spent much of his working life in Europe. A finalist in the 1967 Archibald Prize, his portrait of Rowell positions the sitter against a stark yellow background, bathed in golden light.",

Quite simply I was stagestruck and for a long time that’s really all I wanted to do, I just wanted to work in the theatre, I was mad about the theatre. That seemed enough for a few years, or perhaps for ten years, and then I became terribly conscious of the fact that I was working in a medium that you can never be wholly in charge of as a designer or a producer or a choreographer; you’re one of a number of collaborators working together on a production. And I became more and more interested in the idea of painting because that seemed to me to be something where I could be in charge of a medium and express myself in a way that, much as I love working in the theatre, I would never have that final control about what the statement was. So I started to try and paint and I worked terribly hard. I took myself out of the theatre because I could see that the only way of developing a technique and trying to find a direction as a painter was really to get right out of the theatre for a few years. I did that, and people in the English theatre thought I was mad, but I felt it was something I absolutely had to do.\\n\\nThe paintings I did for the first few years were really not good at all. But I worked very hard, I developed a technique. I simply work in the theatre when I’m offered work that I want to do and when I’m not doing that, I’m up in the studio painting for all I’m worth.\\n\\nI know that this work I do as a painter nourishes all my theatre work, the colours even that I’ve used in the _Sleeping Beauty_ which are very – particularly in the prologue and scenes like that – absolutely strong, chromatic colours I know I don’t see in other theatre. I can only use these because of all I’ve learned as a painter. Anyway, the thing is that both forms of activity now are absolutely necessary to me. People don’t particularly want you to work in two different media but it’s something that I absolutely need.",

Establishing a medical practice in Melbourne, he began to paint with no formal training. After falling in with a group including Arthur Boyd, Charles Blackman, John Perceval, Leonard French, Fred Williams and Clifton Pugh he abandoned medicine for a time to concentrate on his art. Between 1962 and 1988 he held a number of solo exhibitions, mostly of seascapes, that drew admiration from critics including Patrick McCaughey. Hattam and his wife Kate acquired many works by artists in their circle and beyond. Credited as the first private collectors to embrace Fred Williams's art wholeheartedly, they built up a substantial group of his paintings from 1958 onward.",

Larter has also made a significant body of geometric, ethereal and glittery abstract paintings, elements of which have often filled the backgrounds of the figurative works.

But I found that when I wanted to draw the body, the drawing deteriorated in quality the further away from the head you got. So I decided that I would draw nudes and improve my technique.\\n\\nI started drawing nudes, using my wife as a model. At this time I was painting abstract pictures, I was virtually doing sort of a private record of my wife – well she was 17 when I married her and you get sort of gradual change from girlhood to womanhood, sort of thing – and I was sort of creating this private record. After a while I became quite good at this and I thought, well I can use this in my paintings.\\n\\nI find that I’ll draw anybody in the nude if they’ll pose, sort of thing. I enjoy drawing nudes. Then there’s the perverse side of it – I know that they upset people, they upset my mother and she was the first person to be upset. Then as I started to exhibit and send pictures away, people started writing things and saying things about the nudes. I think this made me a little more daring, so instead of being discreet nudes they became very indiscreet nudes. I suppose you say, a Larter nude, you expect to see all the main sexual characteristics. Well fair enough, give a dog a bad name and he’ll live up to it. I’ve certainly done this, I’ve made it more and more and more obvious, I suppose. But I have such strange people asking me … I can remember being at an opening where a funny little solicitor was introduced to me and his whole idea of talking to me was that he thought that if he kept with me long enough eventually we’d get to the girls and he’d have a fine time. I suppose this does sort of produce this sort of reaction in some people. But to me this isn’t the point of doing the work.",

                    "transcript": "Self-portrait with pin-up by Richard Larter was made in 1965. It measures about 125 cm high by 80 cm wide in a narrow plain wood frame. Larter used synthetic polymer paint and alkyd resin on composition board. He applied the paint using a syringe, squirting out short, fine, irregular lines. This technique gives the painting a distinctive drawn style and bumpy surface. Larter depicts himself standing with an image of Robert Menzies behind his shoulder.\\n\\nThe background is painted a pale brown-grey buff with the occasional smear of white and several bright blotches of vibrant red and yellow.\\n\\nRobert Menzies’ face takes up the top left corner of the painting. It is surrounded by a thin black border drawn along its upper, right, and lower edges, while the left edge abuts the portrait’s frame. Menzies is a sparse black outline shaded with minimal cross hatching. His hair is short and neat, and his eyebrows are large and dark. Menzies’ eyes look down and the corners of his thin mouth are also downturned. The image is cropped just below his chin.\\n\\nTo the right of the Menzies image is a blot of saturated red seeping down the portrait. The same colour also emerges as a dome shape on the lower left edge. Additionally, there are two smaller patches of yellow. One, the bottom quarter of a circle, is positioned beneath Menzies and against the left side of the portrait. The other, a yellow half circle, peeps out on the opposite side of the canvas, a bit higher up. On the left bottom edge of the portrait is an ambiguous object with a pointed asymmetrical tip, which rounds out and down like a jug. It is intricately patterned with fine blue lines and is inscribed near its top: RL65. \\n\\nLarter stands in the right foreground, his shoulder obscuring part of Menzies’ jowl. His head is much smaller than Menzies' and his brown, orange, and yellow-flecked hair is in line with Menzies’ brow. Larter’s skin is made from layers of tadpole-shaped lines in yellow, orange, red, pink, and green. The small lines swirl together over Larter’s face in waves across his brow, following the contours around his eyes and nose, and circling his cheeks and chin. Larter has dark slender eyebrows, angling from their inner points downwards. His eyes are blue and look to his right towards Menzies. Larter's mouth is thin and pursed.\\n\\nLarter wears a collared shirt with a blue, striped, grid pattern, and faint patches of yellow. His tie is orange with small dashes of green. His bulky brown jacket is secured by three buttons, its entire surface richly textured with non-uniform vertical lines in browns and grey. Larter's arm on the left of the image extends diagonally down and out. His hand makes a fist with the thumb on the outside. It is directly above, but at some distance from, the ambiguous, blue-patterned object. His other arm hangs down against his body; his hand loosely closed with forefinger just touching the thumb.\\n\\nBeneath his coat, Larter’s legs stand apart. He wears wide, blue trousers, one side of each a darker blue, giving the impression of a crease down their fronts. Larter's legs are cropped just below the knee, by the lower edge of the portrait.\\n\\n**Audio description written and voiced by Lucie Shawcross, 2021**",

After studying in London, she returned with her husband to Australia in 1960 and set up a studio in Paddington. In 1973, with fibre artist Mona Hessing, Gazzard was one of the first craftspeople invited to exhibit at the National Gallery of Victoria. The exhibition, _Clay + Fibre_, generated much discussion about whether craft was art and accelerated acceptance of women artists. Through the 1970s and 1980s she exhibited large abstract works in a number of important group shows and solo exhibitions. Gazzard was also instrumental in the development of craft in Australia, including helping to set up the Crafts Council of Australia in 1971 and chairing the Crafts Board of the Australia Council in 1973. President of the World Crafts Council from 1980 to 1984, Gazzard was commissioned to create the bronze sculpture _Mingarri: The Little Olgas_ (1988), which stands in the central Executive Courtyard of Parliament House, Canberra. The Art Gallery of New South Wales acquired her last major work, _Selini I_ (2009), in 2012.\\n\\nArtist Judy Cassab owned a 1966 work by Gazzard, _Dial_. It has been suggested that it was perhaps exchanged for this portrait of Gazzard that Cassab painted in the same year.",

Sometimes I’m asked where I get my ideas from and it’s hard to say, sometimes it might be sitting in a movie, just a certain shape flicks across the screen and I think ‘That’s just what I’m looking for’, or on a beach a piece of driftwood, or in the park a squashed fig. Anything can supply it when you’re looking, when you’re feeling the need for a new idea.\\n\\nI’d say that the curve is the thing that interests me, seldom the straight line in an object. I’m very sensitive to curves, a wrong curve can ruin it from the first half-inch. If I know it’s somehow not going to be right, I just break it up. I break up a lot of things; in fact in my studio at the moment I can see six or eight things that I will no doubt smash up. Perhaps it’s the scale that’s important in what I do. I keep being dissatisfied with small things, though they can be fun to do at times. I want to do bigger, more massive objects.\\n\\nI never feel so happy as when I’m quietly working alone. And I have everything here to make my work, the kiln, all. An artist has to be very close to his work. I know when I’ve been looking in museums, I’ve often felt that I’ve known the person who’s made that object. Perhaps this doing of one’s own work, one’s own thing, perhaps this is the link between civilisations. Other civilisations have tried to leave us what they knew. Perhaps this is what it’s about.",

As non-Indigenous people arrived and remained in the area he became an important negotiator for the Yolngu. In the late 1940s, Marika contributed to a set of 365 crayon drawings made for anthropologists Ronald and Catherine Berndt. During the 1950s, he encouraged the commercial production of bark paintings, hoping to promote understanding of Yolgnu spiritual beliefs and traditions, and painted large bark works for the Art Gallery of New South Wales. He contributed to the Yirrkala church panels, and was instrumental in sending the bark petition to Canberra that has since become a key document in the history of Aboriginal land rights legislation. Marika was one of the first Indigenous artists to teach his daughters (Banduk and Dhuwarrwarr) to paint and his son, Wandjuk, was a highly influential Indigenous spokesperson and artist.\\n\\nDuring a visit to Avalon Public School in Sydney in the early 1960s, Marika met the painter and sculptor Arthur Murch, who was teaching art to the children. Murch painted this poignant unfinished portrait of the artist in his unique style, depicting Australian people and landscape using Renaissance techniques.",

She began her training in art in 1910 in Sydney, and then spent two years studying in England. In 1915 Cossington Smith' work _The sock knitter_, considered to be the first post-impressionist work painted in Australia, was included in the Royal Art Society exhibition. In the late 1920s, she began work on her now celebrated series of paintings of the Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction. Following the deaths of her parents in the 1930s, Cossington Smith moved from her garden studio at her family home in Turramurra and into the main house and began to focus on intimate paintings of interiors, in which she expressed forms with colour and light. Her contribution to Australian art went largely unrecognised until, at age 81, she was honoured with a retrospective exhibition, which opened at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1973 and toured to state galleries.\\n\\nPainted in 1948, Cossington Smith's self-portrait represents her vibrant use of light-infused colour and interest in structure and form. Depicting herself in the prime of her long career, the short brushstrokes, laden with paint, build up a strong colour portrait and capture the dedication she felt towards her art in her intense focused gaze and the determined set of her lips.",

I used to be very fond of the bush but now I can’t manage to go out in the bush.\\n\\nThe large painting which I have in the Wills art prize competition is an interior. It’s a room with a wardrobe and a bed and a carpet but the chief thing to me was the yellow walls, so that is why I call it _Interior in Yellow_. It was a very exciting thing to do. I wanted to express the forms in colour with the light because the whole thing is meant to express an interior with the light.\\n\\nI use squares in the way I paint, not from a conscious way but it came to me naturally because I feel in that way that light can be put into the colour. whereas just to put colour on to the surface in a flat way, I feel that it gives it a dead look.\\n\\nThe room is in my own home here and the sunlight did not come in in a definite way but the whole room seemed to be full of light, which is what I want to do more than the actual sunlight. I feel that even the shadows are a subdued light and they must have light in them as well as the light parts.",

The prominent frame is dark wood, and between it and the painting is a second, narrow, inner frame of bone coloured canvas.\\n\\nThe dynamism in this portrait comes from the way it has been painted - with small, squarish, paint-laden brush strokes in warm yellows and browns, that seem to flicker and move – dancing across the surface of the canvas. In contrast, Grace appears rather quiet and unremarkable, looking out, through round rimmed glasses, and dressed in a collared shirt. \\n\\nGrace’s head and upper torso dominate the portrait. Behind her, the top half of the painting shows a light filled, green and yellow dappled background, while the bottom half is mostly darker tones, and includes a warm, deep-brown coloured object – possibly the back of a chair. \\n\\nGrace has cropped hair, parted at the centre, and tucked behind her ears. Though it is neat, there is the impression of a wavy texture - created through layered brush strokes in mottled copper-browns, yellow-greens and deep-blues. Grace’s oval face is tilted slightly up, and the right side is angled to the viewer, with light falling on it. Her forehead is high, rounded and smooth. Grace’s eyebrows are obscured by her slender, brown-framed, round-rimmed glasses. \\n\\nThrough the lenses, Grace’s gaze is striking – her eyes are brown and almond shaped, and their look is direct; unfaltering. Perhaps the intense stare is aimed at the viewer, or perhaps at herself, as she works on her portrait, scrutinising her reflection in a mirror.\\n\\nGrace has a straight nose. Her natural-pink lips are pursed, and set in a serious expression. \\n\\nA pink brush stroke defines the curve of Grace’s small, round chin. Three brown flecks give shape to the right side of her jaw, and vertical, smudged dabs in yellow-brown and pink, allude to the slackening skin of the neck of a woman in her mid-fifties. \\n\\nThe collar of Grace’s shirt fits close to her neck, and comes together in a ‘v’. On Grace’s right side, where the light touches it, the front of her shirt is painted in whites, pale pinks and browns, while on her left side, deep reds and patches of dark blue-green indicate shadows. \\n\\nThe bottom edge of the portrait crops Grace off mid-chest. In the left corner, beneath the short sleeve of her shirt, is her bare right arm.\\n\\nIn front of Grace’s left shoulder, in the lower right corner of the painting there are three flat, rectangular shaped objects layered against each other. The objects’ shapes and positions suggest they are the yellow backs of two cardboard canvasses leaning against a brown, timber easel. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

From an artistic family, he began making paintings as a boy and developed a vigorous and expressive style. Although better known for his landscapes and mythical subjects, Boyd made a number of paintings of family and friends, and several self portraits. This one was painted in 1964 when Boyd was living in England. Aged 44, he had just finished a productive period working on set and costume designs for the Royal Ballet production of _Elektra_. Unlike much of Boyd's portraiture in which heads emerge out of a dark background, this self-portrait is painted on a simple white background using a neutral palette. Similar to his earliest self portrait, painted when he was seventeen, his penetrating eyes gaze off into the distance, but this time he looks apprehensive rather than determined, perhaps in response to his sadness following the death of his parents earlier in the decade. Returning to Australia in the early 1970s, Boyd bought a property on the Shoalhaven River on the south coast of New South Wales, Bundanon, which he subsequently gave to the Australian people. In 1975 he made an immense gift of his own work to the National Gallery of Australia.",

But, I mean, you don’t ever come out with anything fresh or marvellous, it always seems ghastly when it goes up on the wall, and maybe it is.\\n\\nI hope it’s becoming less taped, or typed. Not meant to be a pun, but anyway, I think that’s what I’d prefer to be happening, that it’s becoming just as much mine, if I can make it that way, but much less typed in the sense that it would be, well, ‘that’s Australian’, or ‘that comes from Melbourne, that comes from Ballarat, that’s where …’. I’d like it to be much more a universal sort of thing. I don’t mean necessarily the painting to look as if it could be done anywhere, but just that it would be much more like good painting rather than like something that comes from somewhere.",

In London, she was part of the group of young Australian artists, including William Dobell, Donald Friend and Arthur Murch, who worked on a mural for the Wool Secretariat pavilion at the 1938 Empire Exhibition in Glasgow. With the outbreak of war she returned to Australia, thereafter teaching at high schools in the ACT and NSW and at the Julian Ashton and National Art Schools in Sydney. The first of her thirteen solo exhibitions was held at Sydney’s Macquarie Galleries in 1940. Resident in England from 1969 to 1981, she continued to teach intermittently into the late 1970s. After a difficult first marriage to artist Eric Wilson, who died, she married painter Tom Green and they settled in Moss Vale. Though her work is now represented in major state and regional collections, Appleton was like many women artists of her generation in that recognition of her work came late in life: she was in her eighties when a public gallery first presented a retrospective exhibition of her art. \\n\\nJean Appleton won the inaugural Portia Geach Memorial Award in 1965 with this work.",

I like to work very freely and spontaneously in colour. And I feel if one has too much of a preconceived idea, one tends to lose the freshness and get a rather forced and striving feeling about it, as if you were trying to copy something that you already had seen in your mind.\\n\\nI’ve found myself becoming increasingly interested in still life subjects. I feel I like to abstract them a good deal but I’m interested in shapes and objects in space, and their relationship to each other, and I look for the abstract qualities in these things rather than making any effort to reproduce them.\\n\\nI’m interested in order; I don’t like things to be chaotic, and I like to feel that there is an ordered relation between the parts of a painting. Colour, of course, is an absolute joy, and I love warm colours; reds, yellows and warm violets, although I get a great deal of pleasure out of blues, too – I think it’s perhaps unwise to say that you have any favourite colours.\\n\\nI like to work on a fairly large scale and I like to be able to start a painting and go on and work and work at it without being interrupted. I think that’s one of the most difficult things in this modern life we lead, being able to get away from interruptions.\\n\\nBut I do think it’s awfully difficult to say just what your aim is in painting a picture. I feel that the picture says it for you much better than you can say it yourself. And I feel that any good thing in a painting is usually something that you can’t talk about.",

Following her family's relocation from Forbes to Melbourne in the early 1940s, Dawson attended the private art school run by Harold Septimus Power. In 1951, aged sixteen, she enrolled at the National Gallery School and attended night classes with Sir William Dargie. Five years later, Dawson won a National Gallery of Victoria Travelling Scholarship and went to London, where she studied at the Slade School and the Central School. Returning to Melbourne in 1961, she held her first solo exhibition the same year and in 1963 set up an art school and workshop. Dawson was one of only three women included in the influential exhibition of Australian abstraction, _The Field_, at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1968. Her work is represented in all major public collections in Australia, and has been the subject of exhibitions at the NGV and the National Gallery of Australia.\\n\\nOutside of her lyrical abstract work, Dawson always practised portraiture and won the Archibald Prize in 1973 with a portrait of her husband, the late writer, actor and playwright Michael Boddy. Painted during an evening class at the National Gallery School, this self portrait shows Dawson wearing an artist's work shirt over her elegant day clothes, gazing confidently at the viewer.",

Now I find that although I must work directly, I usually work on about three or four paintings and a series of drawings before anything final comes out of this. A final, or a finalised painting, quite often happens fairly quickly. With my particular method it must be very fresh. I find that very clean, very fresh colour is essential. I find tremendous sensual delight in clarity and finality of area, so consequently a painting can’t possibly have any labour on its actual surface, the labour must go on in other places. And I find that the more I work, the more prolonged are these periods of making studies and drawings.\\n\\nI find that I’m continually going back to the figure as being something that contains so much, so many possibilities. Through exploration, probably like all good sensualists, I keep finding the figure in landscape and the landscape in the figure; areas of flesh stretched across muscle or relaxed, tightened up, loose flesh, delicate little veins, bony areas, are things that I feel with tremendous ecstasy that I’ve never yet been able to put down in any way, something that I’m trying very hard to do at the moment.",

After a few years’ drifting between Sydney and Brisbane, picking fruit to make a living, he connected with Barbara Patterson, a poet, who introduced him to literature. They moved to Melbourne, and married in 1951. She was legally blind; supported by her pension, and her earnings from modelling for artists, Blackman began to paint in earnest. With the support of art patrons John and Sunday Reed, he began to produce his signature series of paintings, incorporating schoolgirls with flowers, and Alice in Wonderland scenes with Barbara as his muse. The chase is one of several self portraits Blackman painted in Melbourne in the early 1950s, when he was working in the couple’s humble home alone. Felicity St John Moore, an authority on the artist’s work, describes the painting’s imagery of living and dead flowers as an ‘either-or choice between creation and spiritual death’, observing that the idea of clear choices facing a person at the moment of loss of adolescence – common to both Rimbaud and Gide – reflects Blackman’s intense interest in French literature at this time. Blackman and John Brack were amongst the seven artists who showed in the watershed ‘Antipodeans’ exhibition in Melbourne in 1959, asserting the importance of the figure in art in defiance of advancing American abstract expressionism. Having lived in London and Paris for some years in the 1960s, and separating civilly from Barbara in the late 1970s, Blackman proceeded to series of paintings of cats and gardens, becoming one of very few Australian artists to live to see one of his paintings sell for more than a million dollars.",

But it was not really a sort of disciplined thing, it wasn’t really a thought-out thing. It was a thing where it was chasing a substance, it was kind of style chasing a substance. Once the substance was realised in some sort of sense, then the operative thing was to make it function properly, make it function fully. It’s like, sort of, driving a little baby Austin, finally you become a mature enough driver to be able to run an E-type Jag or a very complex piece of machinery. You have the emotional equipment realised, but it is then to make it a public fact, it is then to make it kind of articulate, a real articulate message in plastic terms, that is, it must be, the feeling must be couched properly in paint, the image must be embedded properly in the paint, must be trapped, as Francis Bacon says very well, in the paint.\\n\\nWell, now I work not so haphazardly, get up very early in the morning, go to the studio, clean up all the brushes, tidy up the room, sweep the floor and start working in a very detached sort of way, and work through disinterest to interest, or work, labour, very long hours on making a painting function within itself in a fairly detached sort of way. But this only could have been done by this kind of organic growth of the personality, it couldn’t have been done in the artificial sense, you can’t outside impose thoughts, they have to grow.",

Born in Queensland and raised in Melbourne, she commenced an Arts degree at the University of Melbourne in the 1940s, but was expelled on becoming pregnant to her boyfriend, Tim Burstall, later to become an influential filmmaker. They married in 1946 and shortly afterwards moved to Eltham, north-east of Melbourne where Betty worked at the local high school as a French and English teacher. In 1967, she founded La Mama in Carlton, an independent theatre modeled on the original off-Broadway theatre in New York, where she lived in the mid-1960s. Local actors, writers, directors, poets and musicians were encouraged to use the space for innovative, small-scale productions, providing an outlet for groundbreaking Australian theatre and fostering writers like David Williamson, Jack Hibberd and Tes Lyssiotis. Artistic director Liz Jones took over in the 1970s and La Mama still exists today. \\n\\nArthur Boyd produced few formal portraits but painted this work in the 1940s when Betty and Tim were regular visitors to his family's property in Murrumbeena. Boyd depicted Betty with flushed cheeks, lost in thought. He also used Betty's distinctive face in his religious paintings in the late 1940s, and in his murals at The Grange.",

And then I talked to a number of actors and directors and writers to see whether they’d be interested or not and they seemed to be interested but it became clear pretty quickly that the writers were the ones who were really interested because they despaired of ever being able to have their stuff done. The actors did have some sort of commercial work and were much less disillusioned. Directors were pretty interested because there’s very little opportunity for local people to direct their own plays. So, I found writers and I found directors and at first it was difficult finding actors disillusioned enough to come and perform virtually for nothing, because that’s how it works.\\n\\nI’ve had some problems because it somehow seems that most plays that are done are obscene in some way or they would be by conventional standards or perhaps could be considered offensive in some way. It’s surprising actually, when I consider the sort of thing that is done, how few times it has happened but we have had on one particularly spectacular occasion Vice Squad visits and interference. This was when, outside La Mama and in the open, a play that was written by John Romeril, specifically an anti-censorship play, was being staged, actually satirising the vice squad. And the Vice Squad arrived, attempted to arrest the members of the cast and were followed to the police station by a sort of chanting audience. And charges were brought and in the end, I think, people were put on bonds and nothing very terrible happened to them, but it was rather unpleasant. I had to go to the vice squad people where I was interviewed in not the most pleasant way. And sort of warned to be very careful about what was done.\\n\\nI get great kicks out of La Mama and one thing that seems rather nice about it is that it’s exactly the same as it’s been from the very beginning. Now, six years later, it’s as sordid, as small, as uncommercial and as wide open as it was.",

Oil on canvas measuring 80 centimetres in height by 64 centimetres wide. The portrait focuses on Betty’s head and torso. Her face is luminous and large dark eyes draw the viewer into the work. The dark curls of her hair nearly touch the top of the canvas. Her body has been cropped at the chest and shoulders which fills the lower half of the painting. She is angled to the right of the frame with her left shoulder in view.\\n\\nShort overlapping brushstrokes create a heavily textured surface for the skin of her face and neck. Betty’s face glows warmly in pale creamy flesh tones. The skin across her cheeks and nose blossom to darker shades of pinks and red. This creates a dramatic contrast with the plain dark background.\\n\\nVoluminous brunette curls flick loosely upwards to frame her broad round face. Her hair is cut to rest above her shoulders. Her left earlobe peeks out amid the dark curls which are tamed into a side part on the right. A few curls casually caress her short forehead. Her deep-set eyes are heavily lidded underneath a prominent brow. She has a long nose and a closed bow-shaped mouth slightly downturned above a softly rounded chin. Her expression is considered, direct and serious.\\n\\nBetty wears a long-sleeved olive-green top with a pointed collar. Loose brushstrokes create textured clothing. Light glistens off the fabric, which appears nearly golden around her neck. A dark line of paint creates a gathered effect across the front of her chest.\\n\\nThe combination of thickly applied paint, surrounding dark background and her sombre expression create a weightiness in the portrait.\\n\\nThe artist’s signature, Arthur Boyd, is painted in black on the lower right.\\n\\n**Audio Description written by Alana Sivell and voiced by Amy Middleby**",

After 18 months in England, he became a founding member of the Australian Journalists’ Association before moving to work as political correspondent for the Sydney evening Sun. In 1915 he became managing editor of the United Cable Service of the Sun and Melbourne Herald in London. From there, he went to Gallipoli; his long, passionate (and distorted) account of the British attitude to Australians there had major ramifications. In 1921 he returned to Melbourne as editor of the evening Herald. Sales increased quickly, and he took over other papers. Over the ensuing years Murdoch acquired diverse media interests and became increasingly interventionist; some saw him as a serious ‘cause of the deterioration in Australian politics’. From 1942 he was Chairman of Directors of the Herald and Weekly Times and director of the Herald, Sun News-Pictorial and associated publications. He married Elisabeth Greene in 1928, when he was 43 and she was nineteen. Their newspaperman son, Rupert, was to become one of the world’s most influential men.",

When she began painting again, in 1945, she wrote \\n\\nthat she’d ‘never let this happen again, this parting from paint and \\n\\nbrush’. Cassab began securing portrait commissions soon after arriving \\n\\nin Sydney with her husband and two sons in 1951. In 1955, her portrait \\n\\nof model Judy Barraclough won the _Australian Women’s Weekly_ Portrait\\n\\nPrize. The win helped establish Cassab’s reputation for portraits that \\n\\nwere distinctly modern yet sufficiently traditional, leading to further \\n\\nportraits of sitters from the fashion world – including June \\n\\nDally-Watkins OAM (1927–2020). Dally-Watkins rose to prominence in the \\n\\nlate 1940s with her modelling work for David Jones and magazines \\n\\nincluding the _Women’s Weekly_. In 1950 she founded the June \\n\\nDally-Watkins School for deportment and etiquette, and in 1951 \\n\\nestablished Australia’s first modelling agency.",

He subsequently became advertising manager at Smith's Newspapers and in 1933, in partnership with Edward Theodore, published the first edition of the _Australian Women's Weekly_. After inheriting the bulk of his father's media interests, he formed Consolidated Press, launching the _Daily Telegraph_ in 1936. His company Television Corporation was one of the first to hold a commercial television licence in Australia, with TCN-9 beginning test transmissions in July 1956. Packer was knighted in 1959. By the early 1960s, _Women's Weekly_ had grown to a circulation exceeding 800,000, helping Australian Consolidated Press (as it was known from 1957) become the largest magazine publisher in the southern hemisphere by the time of Packer's death.  \\n  \\nA keen art collector, Packer supported artists through the _Women's Weekly_ art prizes. Judy Cassab won the women's section of the _Weekly's_ portrait prize in 1955 and 1956, leading to the creation of this portrait of Packer. It was acquired by ACP some years later. Packer's widow and second wife, Florence, Lady Packer, recalled that it had 'lived mainly in Frank's favourite place: the office'.",

Having lectured at the University of London he returned to Australia in 1955, soon taking up a post as a philosophy lecturer at the University of Melbourne. Having published _Berkeley’s Theory of Vision_ (1960) he became a senior lecturer, completed his PhD and brought forth _Perception and the Physical World_ (1961) and _Bodily Sensations_ (1962). In 1964 he became Challis Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney and held this position, interrupted only by visiting professorships in the USA, until his retirement some 28 years later. _A Materialist Theory of the Mind_ (1968) introduced the world to ‘Australian materialism’. Besides writing a plethora of books, the last published in 2010, throughout his life he engaged in public and political affairs, active in the Australian Association for Cultural Freedom and closely involved with its journal, _Quadrant_. Andrew Irvine wrote in _Quadrant_ in 2014 ‘Armstrong’s influence on Australian culture has been enormous simply because his influence on world culture has been enormous.’ ****\\n\\nDavid Armstrong read a draft of the Antipodean Manifesto on art, which Pugh signed, but ‘could not render the verbiage into academically acceptable English’. The portrait of Armstrong was Pugh’s entry in the Archibald Prize of 1959.",

After studying law for two years, Humphries joined the Melbourne Theatre Company. In 1955 he created his archetypes of suburban mediocrity: Mrs Edna Everage, a Moonee Ponds mother and housewife, her longsuffering husband Norm, and the washed-out, ruminative Sandy Stone. From the late 1950s Humphries performed in his own one-man shows in Australia, Britain, Europe and the US, and Edna Everage held court with increasing flamboyance in shows including _Housewife_, _Super-star; Edna_, _the Spectacle_; and _Eat Pray Laugh!_, which Humphries announced would be her last. In 2000 Humphries won a Special Tony Award, a Drama Desk Award, a Theatre World Award, and an Outer Critics Circle Award. He was the subject of the National Portrait Gallery's first large-scale biographical exhibition in 2002. His many books include two different autobiographies, _More Please_ (1992) and _My Life as Me_ (2002) as well as an autobiography of Edna Everage, _My Gorgeous Life_ (1997) in which the meeting between Humphries and Everage is described in detail.\\n\\nClifton Pugh and Barry Humphries became friendly in the 1950s and Humphries sometimes went to stay at Dunmoochin, Pugh's home in the bush near Melbourne. Pugh's portrait of Humphries looking 'haunted, angular and aesthetic' – the very first work acquired by the National Portrait Gallery – was painted there. Through his association with Pugh, Humphries's schoolboy interest in art revived, and Pugh helped him mount an exhibition of his works in the gallery of the Victorian Artists' Society. The exhibition featured some collaborative collages by Humphries and Pugh and an installation of boxes of 'Platytox', a shocking product purportedly designed to eradicate the platypus and most marsupials.",

They wore the uniforms of rebellious university students just as they do today, and in a sense they’re the most conformist of all social groups.\\n\\nI was surprised and disappointed at this, so, again, with the aid of some of my old Melbourne Grammar friends and a few new ones, we reformed the Dada group and we held, in two consecutive years of 1951 and 1952, two widely publicised and spectacular Dada exhibitions in the men’s lounge of the Union at Melbourne University. The catalogues of these two Dada exhibitions survive and are, of course, interesting documents of the period. They consist really of an anarchic attack on certain aspects of modern art which were becoming domesticated – that is to say, Melbourne housewives who knew nothing about art, other than perhaps Arthur Streeton or Hans Heysen on a calendar, were now espousing the post-impressionists, so the exhibitions contained scathing attacks of Van Gogh, Gaugin and Cezanne, indeed on everything that was acceptable to the Australian bourgeoisie, indeed the informed Australian bourgeoisie of this period.\\n\\nThese were happenings, I suppose, though that word hadn’t been coined. As the students came along I would stand on a dais and open the exhibition with a kind of crazy speech and already I was giving vent to a frustrated theatrical energy. I was moving slowly, you know, from painting, from a pictorial language to a theatrical means of self-expression. Within, I was merely a frustrated youth, not at all knowing how best to please my parents, what profession indeed I would ever follow and when was it all going to end?",

                    "content": "Judith Wright (1915-2000) was a poet, literary critic, editor, and fiction writer, as well as an active and influential conservationist and Aboriginal rights advocate. Her poems accordingly reflect 'the love of the land we have invaded and the guilt of the invasion'. Wright met and married the journalist, playwright and bushman Jack McKinney in the 1940s, and the couple became good friends with Charles and Barbara Blackman. Meredith McKinney (b. 1950) was to become a scholar of Japanese and a literary translator. Her collaborative translations of her mother's works have been published in Australia and Japan. This work recalls a day when the Blackman and Wright/ McKinney families, both to assume great cultural significance to Australia, happily picnicked at Cedar Creek near Tamborine in the winter of 1955. It was in private collections for more than forty years before Barbara Blackman heard it was for sale through a Melbourne gallery. She purchased the painting of her 'good dear beloved long friend' especially for the National Portrait Gallery, which she has long championed. In May 2000 the two women were present at a function in the gallery to celebrate the acquisition of the work and Wright's 85th birthday. Wright died just a few weeks later. \\n\\nCharles Blackman OBE (1928-2018), artist, studied at East Sydney Technical College before moving to Melbourne, where he came to the attention of art patron John Reid. With Reid's support, he began to produce his signature series of images, incorporating schoolgirls with flowers and Alice in Wonderland figures and motifs. He was a signatory to the Antipodean Manifesto (loosely, a defence of figuration against abstraction) in the early 1950s. After he won the Helena Rubenstein Scholarship in 1960, his work was shown in the important Whitechapel and Tate exhibitions in London in 1961-1962. Exhibiting prolifically throughout his career, over the 1970s he produced softer images of cats and gardens. In the early 1990s, a period during which he revisited themes of his early work, a Blackman retrospective show toured nationally. Renowned especially for his drawing, Blackman is represented in the National Gallery of Australia and all state galleries.",

                    "transcript": "The Family was painted by Charles Blackman around 1955. It is oil on board and measures about one metre high by 1.4 metres wide in its frame. The frame is narrow light wood with a stepped surface. This dark shadowy portrait shows the heads and shoulders of, in a row from the left: Jack McKinney, Judith Wright, and their daughter Meredith McKinney. They are painted in a distinctive stylised manner. \\n\\nThe background is divided horizontally; the top fifth is painted pale cream and the lower part, behind the figures, is a mixture of dark browns and greys. The focus is on the figures’ faces and hats.\\n\\nJack, on the left, wears a hat with a square box-like crown in washed-out blue above a round reddish brim. His face is blue and almost rectangular. His eyes are on a slant. The eye on our left is lower and larger than the other. Below a dark brow, it is an elongated green almond with a large black iris. The eye on the right is higher on the face, set beneath the hat brim; blue with a black iris and a flash of orange highlighting the eyelid. The straight edges of Jack’s nose run parallel to his cheek. His ear on the far left of the portrait is a loop of apricot and blue with a dark centre. Just below the ear, a hand rests on Jack’s shoulder. The lower part of his face and neck is obscured by deep shadow, only interrupted by a sprig of blue-green foliage. \\n\\nThe central figure, Judith, appears shorter than Jack. Her hat with its much flatter rounded crown and narrow brim does not stand as tall as his. The hat is blue and white striped with dashes of red, orange, and green. Judith’s eyes sit in shade under its brim. They are wide-spaced, blue, with pointed inner corners. Their black irises are positioned towards their rounded outer ends. Just beneath Judith’s eyes, a bunch of flowers of different shapes, sizes, and bright colours, hides the half of her face to our left. On the right her face is painted with smudges of white and pink. A pale haze on either side of her face suggests hair. \\n\\nBetween Judith and Meredith, on our far right, is another brightly coloured bouquet. This seems to be held by one of the figures' hands at the very bottom edge of the portrait.\\n\\nMeredith, on the far right, is smaller and shorter than her parents. Her hat has a square crown with a dome fitted within it sitting on a narrow brim. The hat is patterned with blue, white, yellow, and orange flowers. Beneath the hat is a dark band of shadow concealing Meredith’s eyes. Her face, with grey and white skin, tapers with straight lines to a square chin. Her nose is triangular with a narrow bridge widening out to large, rounded nostrils. Meredith’s lips are small and closed, crimson, outlined with black. On either side of her face is an irregular elongated blue-grey shape, possibly representing hair. In front of her chest is a mass of yellow and blue swirls. Meredith wears a white pointed collar and a floral-patterned top with yellow highlighting her shoulder on the far right of the portrait.\\n\\n**Audio description written and voiced by Lucie Shawcross, 2021**",

She met Hal Hattam, doctor, keen amateur painter and patron of the arts, in England during the war. In Melbourne, the couple became friends with a group of inner-city intellectuals and aesthetes, and entertained and encouraged many emerging artists who have since become household names. At Kate’s behest, artists including John Perceval, Arthur Boyd and Leonard French designed wrapping paper and greeting cards for Georges. The Hattam family homes in Canterbury and South Yarra housed an unrivalled body of works by artists in their circle and beyond. \\n\\nClifton Pugh was a close friend of the Hattams and they championed his work. They went regularly to Pugh's home, Dunmoochin, on weekends, and also saw the Pughs at Shoreham, where each family had a house. This portrait captures Kate's style and determination in Pugh's characteristic elongated forms and bold colour against an abstract background. Pugh recalled that it was rare for him to make portraits in this period, 'but then of course, I knew Kate so well. It was a picture that I wanted to do.'",

He was a longstanding member of the Labor Party, and was deeply involved in Jewish community affairs throughout his life. Ashkanasy helped improve representation to government for Jewish groups, contributed to the foundation of the Judean League and the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies, and was five times president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.\\n\\nKarl Duldig studied art in Vienna between 1923 and 1933 and fled to Switzerland shortly before Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938. He then went to Singapore where he ran an art school, but was deported to Australia as an enemy alien in 1940. After a year in an internment camp in Victoria, he became an art teacher while also gaining recognition for his expressionist sculptures. Awarded the Victorian Sculptor's Society Prize in 1956, Duldig received commissions up until the year before his death at age 83.",

Rivett regularly visited Brisbane’s brothels as municipal medical officer, and was an early and persistent advocate of birth control and sexual health. She gained her master's degree in surgery in 1918. In 1929 Christine became the first Queensland woman to gain an A-class pilot’s licence, and became a foundation member of the Queensland Medical Women's Society. Meanwhile, in 1927, her brother Edward bought a Walter Burley Griffin house in Castlecrag, Sydney, which he converted to a private maternity hospital. After the Second World War, Christine joined her brother, practising obstetrics and experimenting in telepathy and ESP. Brother and sister died within a few months of each other.\\n\\nDaphne Mayo received a gold medal for sculpture at London's Royal Academy of Arts and worked tirelessly to promote appreciation of the arts in Queensland.

His success as Director of Rationing during the Second World War led to him being appointed Director-General of Postwar Reconstruction, in which role he developed plans for full employment and the alleviation of other social problems. Economic adviser to seven Australian prime ministers (Curtin, Chifley, Menzies, Holt, McMahon, Gorton and Whitlam), Coombs was central to the establishment of the Australian National University and was the first Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs. \\n\\nIt is thought that this portrait bust may have come about during Norma Redpath's time as the HC Coombs Creative Fellow at ANU.

He arrived in Sydney in 1897 and soon became the major competitor of the art teacher Julian Ashton. Grace Cossington Smith, Roland Wakelin and Roy de Maistre were all Rubbo's students. The first modernist paintings in Australia arose from his openness to new ideas, and his studio was the venue for stimulating talks by artists who had been able to travel and observe developments in art overseas. However, he painted in a conventional style himself, and later publicly condemned the modern art that he had promoted. He was a member of the Brother Brushes of Bondi, started the Atelier Club, and helped to found both the Manly Art Gallery and Historical Collection and the Dante Alighieri Art and Literary Society.\\n\\nArthur Murch, sculptor and painter, was one of the many significant Australian modernist artists to have trained at Antonio Dattilo Rubbo's school in Sydney.",

He worked as a commercial editor on the Age and made his first investments in the textiles industry before a visit to Broken Hill sparked his interest in mining. Entering into a partnership with his brother in his London stockbroking company, he began to advise on the expansion of mines over a large area of Queensland and New South Wales, from Cloncurry to Broken Hill. Robinson was crucial to the moulding of Australian policy on non-ferrous metals during and after World War I, and acted as the Prime Minister’s personal adviser on the lead and zinc industries until 1920. In 1930, he coordinated a group of Australian and international financiers to form Gold Mines of Australia (GMA). Western Mining Corporation developed out of GMA in 1933 to number amongst the base metal mining companies combined as the Collins House group. During World War 2 the enormous task of dovetailing British demand for base metals with Australia’s (and other) sources of supply fell to Robinson, and he endured a phenomenal amount of punishing international travel to ensure there were no bottlenecks in vital supplies and raw materials for the allied war effort. Robinson’s memoirs, If I remember rightly, were published in 1967.\\n\\nSir William Dobell OBE (1899–1970) trained at the Julian Ashton School before spending ten years abroad, studying at the Slade School and exhibiting at the Royal Academy. When he returned, he was hailed as a modernist. After working in a camouflage unit he was appointed an official war artist; as such, he produced some of his most inspired portraits including The Billy Boy, one of Australia’s best-loved, and supposedly defining, artworks. In 1943 his strange portrait of his fellow artist, Joshua Smith, won the Archibald Prize; but the court case that ensued over whether the work was a portrait or a caricature caused great distress to both artist and sitter. In 1948 he won the Archibald less controversially with his portrait of Margaret Olley, and he won the Wynne Prize for landscape the same year. A third successful Archibald painting followed in 1959, and Time commissioned his portrait of Robert Menzies for its cover in 1960. The Art Gallery of New South Wales held a huge Dobell retrospective in 1964. After the artist’s death his entire estate went to the creation of the Dobell Foundation, which benefits various organisations and funds the Chair of Fine Arts at the Australian National University.",

                    "content": "Sir Hudson Fysh KBE DFC (1895–1974) was one of Australia’s great aviation administrators. Born in Launceston, Tasmania, he enlisted at the beginning of World War I and served in the Australian Flying Corps, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1919 he qualified as a pilot. Later that year he was commissioned by the government to survey the Darwin to Longreach section of the Britain-Australia Air Race, which lack of funds had prevented him from entering. In November 1920 Fysh and Pat McGinnis, who had driven with him on the survey, joined two others to form Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Ltd (QANTAS). Fysh became managing director of the company in 1923, but continued to work as a pilot over the next seven years as QANTAS established various routes and functions in Queensland, including an air ambulance service. In 1934, in partnership with Imperial Airways, QANTAS began to operate the Singapore-Australia air route, trading as Qantas Empire Airways (QEA). Six years later Fysh became a director of Tasman Empire Airways Ltd, which flew to and from New Zealand. Fysh oversaw further expansion of QEA, and its purchase by the Australian government, before retiring as the company’s managing director in 1955 and chairman in 1966. Between 1965 and 1973, he published three autobiographical volumes covering the history of Qantas; a biography of Henry Reed, a key figure in the early development of Launceston; and book on trout fishing, Round the Bend in the Stream.\\n\\nWilliam Dobell (1899–1970) was commissioned to paint Fysh for the thirtieth anniversary of Qantas in 1950. Though he and his wife liked it, Fysh described the painting as ‘rather a shock to some people’. It was, he said, ‘a magnificent piece of work of a great master, but the treatment of the face… made me look so dissipated and haggard as to cause me to remark that if someone in fifty years’ time were told that the subject was a founder of the great airline Qantas, he would refuse to believe it.’",

Showing little promise as an artist, he qualified as a tailor and cutter in London. His grandfather was David Jones, and he began work in the David Jones clothing factory in 1902. By 1905, he was the store’s advertising manager; he became a director in 1906, when David Jones Limited became a public company, and was to be its chairman from 1920 to 1958, as the store expanded in Sydney and then across the country. A cofounder of Art in Australia and The Home in the 1920s, he was a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales for twenty-four years and established the David Jones Art Gallery. He took a keen interest in music, and amongst his many other public positions was the first chairmanship of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, in 1932. That year, as a member of the Board of Control of the new Australian National Travel Association, Jones gave a lecture on ‘Selling Australia to the World’, a topic which remained of vital interest to him. The Travel Association arranged for the production and overseas distribution of posters and booklets showing Australia’s scenery, flora and fauna, and produced a booklet, ‘Talking Points’, available to any Australian travelling abroad, suggesting conversational gambits that would shed favourable light on the country. Jones persisted with his own painting, and exhibited often with the Society of Artists. Meanwhile, he built up a very significant collection of paintings by other artists. He lived at Rosemont in Ocean Street, Woollahra, and was a genial member of several clubs.\\n\\nWilliam Dobell (1899–1970) painted Jones the year he was knighted, during the six-year period in which he was commodore of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron (by the time he took up the position, in 1949, he had been sailing out of the Squadron for forty-six years). Jones’s close friend, Sir Robert Menzies, gave his funeral oration.",

As a young woman she had abandoned her studies at the University of Sydney and turned her back on an oppressively respectable – and sometimes violent – upbringing. An atheist and advocate of free love, her only significant relationship ended when she was 38. Thereafter, she became known for her anarchic conduct in public places, although she did carry a board advertising her willingness to recite Shakespeare for a fee. She loved tram and taxi travel, though she rarely paid, and often hurled herself at vehicles refusing to carry her. She frequented the Public Library of New South Wales until being banned from the building in the late 1950s. As documented in this drawing by Roderick Shaw, Miles was usually seen wearing a tennis visor and a greatcoat. The drawing is posthumous and based on a photograph, and was commissioned for an exhibition in 1976. Miles was nevertheless an apt subject for Shaw, who was a founding member of Artists for Democracy and of Artists Against Nuclear War and who is known for his social realist paintings on themes such as work and urban life.",

Diagnosed with optic atrophy, she was declared blind by the age of 22. 'It seemed to me I was given a life sentence for a crime I had not committed,' she wrote in her 1997 autobiography _Glass after Glass_. She met artist Charles Blackman after moving to Sydney to study, and by 1952 they'd married and relocated to Melbourne. There they became associated with the avant-garde group centred around the Melbourne Contemporary Art Society, and Barbara modelled for artist friends including John Brack and Clifton Pugh. She came to consider her blindness a gift for the richer access it provided to words, poetry, intuition and the imagination, and it had a profound influence on her husband's art, prompting works such as his _Schoolgirls_ and _Alice_ series, in which he created dreamlike imagery based on personal, literary and musical themes. Barbara Blackman also worked as a magazine columnist and a radio-producer for Radio for the Print Handicapped, and helped form the National Federation of Blind Citizens. A documentary about her life, _Seeing from Within_, was released in 2017.",

                    "transcript": "It was in many ways a very unlikely marriage, for a person near-blind or going blind to marry someone whose whole world was a visual world and who was so creative in that visual world. But somehow what his creations came out of – a sort of a living or understanding of poetry – was something that always bound us and still binds us together. But at that time when I recognised Charles as potentially a very great painter and a great creator, I relinquished my strong intentions of being a writer and although I went on writing diaries and sometimes poems and more and more I became a very prolific letter-writer as I gathered more and more interesting people as friends and we became more and more separated by distance, my writing changed course, as in fact my life had changed course to become devoted to Charles’ optimal putting forward of himself as a painter.\\n\\nYou know, when we married I said, ‘Well if you’re going to be a painter, you’re going to paint, you’re not going to go out and get a job doing something or another,’ so he stayed home and painted. And by this time my eyesight had failed almost altogether and I was on a blind pension, so we had that as a basis to live on. And the only thing I could really do was to work as an artist’s model, as a nude model, which in fact I quite enjoyed because I was picking up a lot of information about painting. It’s quite an elegant job in its way, being a model, because one can decide one’s own poses and it’s a very private occupation. One can have one’s own thoughts and one has the satisfaction of knowing one’s doing a job well.",

Born on Ukerebagh Island at the mouth of the Tweed River, New South Wales, Bonner worked in labouring jobs before moving to Palm Island, Queensland, his wife's traditional home, which was at that time a government-run penal settlement. There, he began his involvement in community affairs, joining the Palm Island Social Welfare Association. After moving to Ipswich in 1960, he joined the One People of Australia League (OPAL), later becoming Queensland President in 1968 and National President in 1980. He joined the Liberal Party after the successful 1967 Referendum. In 1971, the Liberal Party invited him to fill a Senate vacancy; famously, soon after giving his maiden speech, he demonstrated how to throw a boomerang on the Senate Lawn. Elected as Senator in four subsequent elections between 1972 and 1980, he frequently crossed the floor to vote with the Opposition on Indigenous issues. After retiring from politics, he served as a member of the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and was a patron of World Vision and Amnesty International.\\n\\nWell-known for his pen and ink drawings, Louis Kahan's works comprise an expressive composite portrait of Australian public figures in the 1960s and 1970s. This quick sketch captures Bonner's strength and focus.",

After training as a tailor in Vienna, at twenty Kahan moved to Paris, where he worked for the couturier Paul Poiret, first as a tailor and then a designer. In 1939, he enlisted in the Foreign Legion; with the American Red Cross in North Africa, he made thousands of rather glamorous portraits of wounded servicemen. In Paris again, he was an illustrator for _Le Figaro_, but in 1947 he came to Australia, settling in Melbourne. Soon after, the editor of _Meanjin_ asked him to make a series of pen and ink portraits of writers for the journal. Over the next fifty years his portrait drawings were hung in many Melbourne homes. He won the Archibald Prize in 1962 with a startling painting of Patrick White. Melbourne’s Jewish Museum held a multifarious Kahan retrospective in 1997.",

He received his first lessons in art from his father, an amateur painter, before studying with Antonio Dattilo Rubbo at the Royal Art Society and at the East Sydney Technical College. Unlike most of his artist contemporaries, Hinder went to the United States for further study, training at the Art Institute of Chicago school in 1927–28 and studying commercial art at the New York School of Fine and Applied Art and the Master Institute of the Roerich Museum. He worked as a commercial artist in America and taught at an art school in Boston before returning to Australia with his wife, the New York-born sculptor Margel Harris, and their daughter, Enid, in 1934. In Sydney, Hinder and Margel became involved with artists Ralph Balson, Grace Crowley and Rah Fizelle, enlivening the 1930s art scene with modernist work based on his experience of cubism. Among his best known works are those inspired by the city’s underground railway system, such as Subway, Wynyard (1948). Hinder was a founding member of the Contemporary Art Society and in 1939 helped organise Australia’s first exhibition of abstract art, Exhibition 1. Hinder worked in the camouflage unit of the Royal Australian Engineers during World War II, devising methods of concealing large structures such as the petrol storage tanks in Newcastle and Port Kembla. After the war, he taught at the East Sydney Technical College and the Sydney Teachers’ College and also worked in theatre design and commercial art. Hinder’s abstract paintings and electric light sculptures attracted much critical acclaim and he assisted Margel in the completion of a number of public sculpture commissions in the 1950s and 60s. This self portrait is characteristic of Hinder’s work in its sharp-edged precision.",

It’s quite different to the way I worked previously, when I made very careful and thorough drawings, enlargements, colour sketches and so forth. I feel again, as my wife said, as she feels she’s becoming more on the expressionist side, so my own work in one sense is loosening up, and I find possibly that starting on the job itself and trying to carry it through then possibly either throwing it away or scraping it off and starting again, allows one to do things that are a more definite approach. Sometimes [it] ties down. In other words, I think I tend to be much too tight or worry too much about the little sketches, and in the process of doing that the big one loses a certain amount of spontaneity. I’m quite sure it’s my fault; it’s not in the procedure because the old masters, I understood it, worked that way and certainly their final results, to me, leave nothing to be desired. But again, it’s the method of trying a slightly different approach.\\n\\n[I’m] still working, of course, with theatre, and with this, and at the moment I’m getting back to painting again, as there seems to be less theatre work, and so I have more time too.\\n\\nI should have mentioned previously, of course, one reason I married my wife was, I thought I had one of the best critics, and she’d be very handy to have around, apart from any other reason.\\n\\nAnd as she knows, I usually ask her opinion, and then she gets very irritated if I, not necessarily disagree with her but I still insist, that she says ‘What?’ but I’ve found it’s pretty infallible. In other words, I’m not my own best critic by a long shot, and one needs a certain amount of either support, moral support or an outside view, I think, and I certainly value hers more than anyone else’s.",

After war service he resumed his studies, and in 1949 secured a job in the National Gallery of Victoria’s Print Room, where he worked until 1951, leaving to take up the position of art master at Melbourne Grammar School. His paintings succeeded immediately; his first exhibited work, Barber’s Shop, was purchased for the NGV in 1953 as was Collins Street, 5pm, three years later. In 1962 he became Head of the National Gallery Art School. Six years later, finally confident that he could make a living as a full-time artist, he resigned. He painted shopfronts, school yards, gardens and housing estates, nudes, office workers, ballroom dancers, jockeys, brides, drinkers, commissioned portraits and portraits of friends and family. In recent years _The Bar_ 1954 and _The Old Time_ 1969 have set new auction records for the sale of Australian paintings. This drawing was presented by the young John Brack to his friend Ursula Hoff, who was the Keeper of Prints at the National Gallery of Victoria from 1949. The work is much softer than the paintings, drawings and prints for which Brack was soon to become renowned. Art historian Sasha Grishin explains that the young artist used a study Georges Seurat made for Une Baignade, Asnières, as a guide to his own materials and composition.",

What I’m interested in in painting is people, of course, principally, how they live, how they behave, how they get the faces they deserve, how they can bear to put up with a life which seems so curiously tragic.\\n\\nOf course I know that to be interested in people’s behaviour for a painter is most impure. It’s called literary, and in our day nothing could be a greater sin than to be a literary painter; but now I’m old enough to feel that it’s a waste of time to apologise for not painting in some other way, and the fact is that I’m still always fascinated by people and their behaviour. And yet at the same time, it’s not enough to just paint pictures of ideas; at the same time we must put it into a visual form which is as complete as any abstract visual form. And here, there’s always a conflict between the demands of the idea and the demands of the form.\\n\\nAnd in any case, I’m always dubious about the remarks painters make about their own work, because what we so often say is rather what we would like to have done than what we’ve really done.",

That year she helped establish the Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC), which sought to eliminate discrimination in the private rental market. Using a $500,000 grant from the Whitlam government, the AHC helped create a sense of belonging for people living in The Block, which became in turn became the centre of the civil rights movement in Australia. Four decades later, in protest against the proposed sale of The Block for commercial development, she established the Redfern Aboriginal Tent Embassy. During 2014 and 2015 she lived there for 400 days, leading the campaign to preserve access to affordable housing for Aboriginal families and maintain The Block's significance as a site for First Nations self-determination, community and leadership.\\n\\nAt first glance it might appear that photographer and filmmaker John Janson-Moore's portrait of Munro was taken at a campsite on Wiradjuri country. In fact, it shows her outside the tent she occupied in Redfern for fifteen months, in the midst of a land rights battle fought in Australia's most populous city.",

My writing is nearly all early morning or late at night at home, conceived in the head as I walk. I walk an enormous amount, walk around the suburbs and things like that, and things come in my head when I’m walking, largely because I find it very hard to concentrate unless my body is active. Perhaps this is a result of my obsession with sport, which I regard as a kind of activity in which the dichotomy between soul and body gets relaxed, a kind of activity in which I find release. I find it very hard, indeed I envy painters and sculptors very much because they have a physical activity which corresponds to the production of their art, whereas poets can only sit there and write, and this I find difficult. I get up and pace and dance and walk around and go for long walks, just as a way to release myself.\\n\\nI find my poetry can begin in any one of a host of ways. I suppose much more when I was young it came just from lines in the head, rhythms, almost you might say, melodies. Now it comes in a variety of ways but ideas play a much larger part now. Seldom do I find poems coming immediately out of a direct experience. It takes a prolonged period, for the most part, of contemplation wherein one experience feeds into other experiences, forms of language, metaphors, ideas coming from quite different areas, until the whole conception becomes dense enough to produce a poem. I find if I try and write poems immediately out of some intense emotional experience, it’s odds on they’ll be merely subjective or private or rhetorical. I need to find something that produces enough density to create a poem that works and not just something for the scrapbook.",

He is recognised as the first person to link Aboriginal art and culture with European painting techniques. Born at Hermannsburg (Ntaria) near Alice Springs, Namatjira had been making art for much of his life before becoming interested in watercolour painting in the 1930s. Exhibiting from 1938 to acclaim and working prolifically, demand for his paintings increased during the 1940s. Though famous by the 1950s, First Nations people were not recognised in the Australian constitution at this time and faced widespread prejudice and inequality. Namatjira met Queen Elizabeth II in Canberra in 1954, and was the first Aboriginal person to receive citizenship in 1957, but restrictions on his family and his community remained engrained and complex, ultimately leading to his death in 1959. His distinctive style, though seemingly taking on the appearance of Western landscape traditions is rooted in deep ancestral connection and knowledge of the lands spanning his father's country around the MacDonnell Ranges and his mother's country in the region of Palm Valley in Central Australia. The Gamatj clan leader Yunupingu AM leader has explained that in his work Namatjira was 'demonstrating to the rest of the world the living title held by his people to the lands they had been on for thousands of years'.\\n\\nPhotographer Axel Poignant spent three months with Namatjira and his wife Rubina (Ilkalita, 1903–1974) while working as a cameraman on Namatjira the Painter. A Kukatja woman, Ilkalita and their children often travelled with Albert on painting trips and another photograph by Poignant taken at the same time shows the family together. This image was taken on Arrernte Country in the MacDonnell Ranges, likely near Mparntwe/Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory.",

In 1963 he and his friend, composer Peter Sculthorpe AO OBE (1929-2014), took a working holiday in Tasmania. Out of this trip emerged Sculthorpe’s best-known piece, ‘Small Town’, inspired in part by Drysdale’s paintings of towns and dedicated to the painter. In 2014, after the composer’s death, an American writer for the _New Yorker_ described visiting Victoria for the first time, and finding that Sculthorpe’s pizzicato and percussive effects ‘perfectly evoked the landscape . . . its vernacular architecture, beautiful stands of eucalyptus, red hills, dry grass, and sudden screaming flocks of lorikeets’. The composer once said that like the painter, he had come to look on his ‘whole output as one slowly emerging work’. At Tallow Beach on the central coast of NSW, close to Drysdale’s property at Bouddi, David Moore photographed two men who profoundly influenced Australians’ way of imagining their own place, creating, as he did so, one of the great Australian portraits-in-the-landscape.",

When I listen to music I only hear it with my heart. Of course, it goes through the ears and the brain and so on and so on, but if it moves me, well, that’s all. I don’t want to analyse it. Of course, one has to for students and so on but that’s irrelevant, I just want to soak it in. And that is all, surely, that music is about. And so everything that I write comes from my feelings or my experience of life and of living.\\n\\nIt’s getting started that is the difficulty, and almost always I get started through some, well, feeling in my heart, that sounds vague but it means something to me anyway, or something that I see, even something that I smell, but rarely anything that I hear, oddly enough. Once I’ve got started, I’m right. And I am a slow worker, but then to be a composer it’s just sheer hard work.\\n\\nYou have to forget technique or else you maybe just get beyond it, in a sense be as a kind of sieve, although I don’t believe in spiritualism, shall we say, I’ll use the word medium, in that it comes through you in some way. Because if I am being occupied with the technique, somehow the message just will not get across or the heart thing. It’s very hard to explain, and this is why I can’t really talk about method.\\n\\nI suppose I have lots of little secrets and I suppose that this is why my music always sounds like me, because it has the same faults and the same virtues, if any, whatever kind of piece it may happen to be. This is something that I try to get across to my students, they’ve just got to write and write and write until they can handle notes and juggle them about, and then just forget all about it and abandon themselves to being what they are.",

I know that lots of people say that they can’t see much in the burnt dried-up plains. But on the other hand, you’ve got this tremendous sense of space, of freedom, allied to it again a strange, age-old quality, and you get without doubt, a tremendously romantic element.\\n\\nOne’s only got to walk around about on the Nullarbor Plain and look at the shapes of organisms, the long dead age, sea forms that reveal themselves for you on the rocks patterned like tracery, things that lived 15 million years ago in the Miocene seas. And besides you, peculiar spectacle of a railway running across this former sea bed, ballasted with the fossil remains of these creatures. See, you’ve got all the elements of most extraordinary sort of dramas, I mean, they have an effect, they help one to look at a landscape, they help one to see these peculiar things.\\n\\nI don’t think I can elaborate very much more, really, because it’s quite difficult to talk about one’s own paintings. One just does them, really.\\n\\nEverybody knows the elemental factors that go to make works of art, but when one tries to talk about oneself and one’s point of view, the same old question comes up: you really don’t quite know. There’s first of all the impact, and there you are.",

When the present-day polymer plastic notes began to replace paper ones in 1992, Andrews served on the advisory panel overseeing their design. Andrews was nominated a Fellow of the Society of Industrial Artists (UK) in 1955 and was the first Australian designer to be elected an Honorary Designer for Industry of the Royal Society of Arts (UK) in 1989.",

In the original problem of producing the one, two, ten and twenty, I had thought of using Caroline Chisholm on the reverse of the one to go with Her Majesty’s portrait, but the bank knocked that right back. They said, ‘Well, we don’t quite think that Caroline Chisholm is the right person.’ In any case, it wasn’t a very good idea, I think that it was better to have something quite abstract on the back of that one. Finally, then, in the next series, once the first four were published, they then quickly said, ‘Well, we must now produce a five’ which was always intended in the first series. So I put Caroline Chisholm up again and then she was okayed. They’d had time to think about it.\\n\\nFor the two dollar I had two primary production people, I had a wool man and the wheat man, the backbone original thing of Australia. Then on the 10 dollar I had two people from the field of art, one an architect and one a writer. Then on the 20 I got into the more inventive things and the more courageous things. Aviation was a good theme so I used Smithy and Hargrave, Smithy being the great explorer, aviator, and Hargrave being a great inventor of aircraft.\\n\\nAlthough bank notes are security documents and the first problem, right in front of your mind always, must be security – how can you make it more difficult for a counterfeiter to copy – it still remains, in a sense, a work of art, or I’d prefer to call it, in fact, a work of design, because I believe that design also can come under the broad heading as art. A really good piece of design is in a sense a work of art.",

Summers became involved in women's rights while studying politics at the University of Adelaide, and was one of five founders of the Women's Liberation Movement group in Adelaide in 1969. After moving to Sydney, she was part of a cooperative that established Australia's first refuge for domestic violence victims. As a journalist for _The National Times_ she investigated NSW prisons, which led to a royal commission and a Walkley Award for Summers. Appointed head of the Office for the Status of Women in 1983, Summers was instrumental in the passage of the Anti-Discrimination Act; in the 1990s she worked as an adviser to Prime Minister Paul Keating. In New York from 1986 to 1992, Summers was editor-in-chief of _Ms_ magazine; and later edited the _Good Weekend_. Author of eight books, her memoir _Unfettered and Alive_ was published in 2018 and she is a columnist for the _Sydney Morning Herald_.\\n\\nThese portraits by Carol Jerrems were taken in January 1974, while Summers was working intensely on _Damned Whores and God's Police_ in her Birchgrove flat. Summers has said the portraits capture her anxiety about this project as well as the steeliness that enabled her to complete it.",

Having narrowly escaped Auschwitz as a girl, Mora trained in drama in Paris. By 1951, when she came to Melbourne with her husband, Georges, she was committed to painting. Soon the couple became friends with the city's leading artists and collectors, and were instrumental in the re-formation of the Contemporary Art Society. Over the 1950s and 1960s they opened the European-style Mirka Café in Exhibition Street, Balzac in East Melbourne and the Tolarno in St Kilda. While Georges established himself as an art dealer, opening Tolarno Galleries in 1967, Mirka became a bohemian icon of the city. She worked prolifically for six decades across a range of media and is represented in many state and regional collections. \\n\\nIn the mid-1960s Lazar Krum took several portraits of Mora and her family at her studio/home on Collins Street. In this image, Mora poses before a mural of her characteristic softly rounded, angelic figures, her eyes opened wide in playful mimicry of their unblinking gaze. Photographer Krum suggests the image 'has captured Mirka, in the midst of her iconic faces, caught between both the delightful and ominous nature of her life experience'.",

Actually my drawings are like living dreams. Sometimes they appear very incoherent but I know that all this incoherence, if I search in it the truth is there. Each drawing has a very strong meaning. It as if my unconscious – or subconscious – would want to become conscious. Each drawing is a riddle which I have to decipher, and this is why I can never, I will never stop drawing because the answers of the riddles always come, sooner or later.\\n\\nWhen I was expecting my third child I was drawing my little people all the time. Sometimes I’d draw little animals too, but they have human legs or they have human arms. This goes back far away in the history of art, of course, I’m aware of that, but it’s a truth and it travels all through time and it comes and visits some artists from time to time. Must be that little beast we’ve got inside us, that’s what it is. Anyhow, when I was expecting my third child, all my little drawings had four toes, and everybody used to say, ‘Why do you do four toes? You know a foot has five toes’, and I said, ‘Well, my people have four toes, you know, I can’t help it, my hand does it. I’m not thinking about it. It just has to have four toes because when I feel the foot it just comes out with four toes’. And when my baby came out, he was born, it had one foot with four toes.\\n\\nSo you can see what faith I have in my work. The truth is inside you always and you have to find it.",

The following year she was diagnosed with Friedreich's Ataxia, a rare and terminal degenerative disease of the nervous system for which there is no cure. She began using a wheelchair in 1996 when she was twenty-six. In 1997 she was nominated as NSW Young Australian of the Year for her work in establishing the Theresa Byrnes Foundation to raise money for research into the disease. After publishing her autobiography _The Divine Mistake_ in 1999, she moved to New York the following year, where she has lived ever since. Byrnes regularly exhibits her paintings in New York, Washington, London and Sydney, and received the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Artist Grant for her painting in 2003 and 2006. Best known for her provocative performance works, she uses her whole body to create edgy artworks using materials such as diesel, ink and mud.\\n\\nPhotographer Greg Weight took this image for the cover of Byrnes' autobiography. In his book _Australian Artists_, Weight described Byrnes as 'a woman with a mission … determined to fulfil her life's purpose and her ambition as an artist while she is still able'.",

She is probably the best-known Utopia artist after her late aunt, Emily Kame Kngwarreye. Petyarre first gained recognition for her batiks, exhibiting from 1977 with the Utopia Women's Silk Batik Group. Although she only began painting in acrylics on canvas in the late 1980s, since her first solo exhibition in 1991 she has had a dedicated following of public and private collectors in Australia and internationally. Using layers of tapering dots, dashes and swirling lines, her many paintings portray Awelye (women's ceremonies and body paint designs) and various Dreamings, including the Mountain Devil Lizard and her signature, Bush Medicine Leaves. Petyarre was awarded the Wynne Prize at the Art Gallery of NSW in 1999 for one of her _Leaves_ works, the first Aboriginal artist to receive this coveted award for landscape painting.\\n\\nFor the exhibition and book _Studio: Australian Painters Photographed by R. Ian Lloy_d (2007), art critic John McDonald and National Geographic photographer Lloyd travelled 50,00 km around Australia over three years. This photograph shows Petyarre painting in a shed in Alice Springs. Lloyd and McDonald watched her, seemingly 'completely unflappable', as she applied layer upon layer of tapering dots with patient repetitive strokes, making another of the many paintings with which she has long helped to support her relatives in Utopia.",

In Melbourne, he and his pub band The Dots made two albums before breaking up in 1982. He recorded Post in Sydney in 1985, but his major break came the following year, by which time his band was known as The Coloured Girls. Their double album Gossip was one of the biggest Australian records of the year. The band made Under the Sun (1987) before touring the US as Paul Kelly and the Messengers. They disbanded in 1991, and from that point Kelly branched into producing and acting as well as writing and performing. Kelly sings with a marked Australian accent and many of his songs refer to specific Australian people and places. Though he has written most of his long and poetic songlist alone, over the course of his nineteen albums has also collaborated brilliantly, particularly with indigenous performers such as Kev Carmody, Christine Anu and Yothu Yindi. His self-described 'mongrel memoir', How to Make Gravy, was released in 2010. \\n\\nKelly has written many songs about Melbourne, where Martin Philbey photographed him at Flinders Street Station.",

McAllister was the Australian Ballet's artistic director and lived in Melbourne; Enoch was in either Sydney or Brisbane, as the director of the Sydney Festival, and as the director of the Queensland Theatre Company before that. But they maintained a policy of phoning one another daily, and of never going more than three weeks without seeing each other – somewhere. Peter Brew-Bevan wanted his portrait of them to capture this together-but-apart aspect of their relationship, while at the same time telling of 'their very strong bond and love for each other'. This is suggested by their poses and body language: seated together but looking away from each other and connected only through their hands. The composition is partly inspired by paintings by Edward Hopper as well as some of David Hockney's 1970s portraits, wherein couples are shown in simultaneous attitudes of isolation and intimacy. The retro hotel room setting further signifies lives spent in separate cities and on the road, and alludes to collective experiences of disconnection and separation during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The esky in which McAllister appears to be icing his foot symbolises his 'hard physical commitment and dedication to dance, spending pretty much every night with his feet in ice', while Wesley's t-shirt is a statement of his pride as a Noonuccal Nuugi man and his uncompromising advocacy for First Nations culture and creativity. \\n\\nThe 2021 Sydney Festival marked the end of Enoch's tenure as festival director. McAllister left the Australian Ballet in late 2020 after almost 40 years with the company. 'I have Wesley by my side,' he wrote at the time, 'and I'm looking forward to us becoming old men together.'",

                    "transcript": "I was one of those weird kids that just always wanted to dance. My family, you know, are fantastic; they're wonderful people. Dad was an accountant, Mum was my mum and I have brothers and sisters that there's no artistic sort of dance background in our family at all. So, I was this sort of mutant child who, you know, used to dance around the house all the time and I used to dance in front of the TV when the TV was off so I could see myself, you know, moving around. And whenever there was a family gathering, I was always putting on a show and annoying the hell out of everyone. So, I guess it was in my DNA and I didn't really have a plan B. I’d started training when I was seven. I didn't realize that all the other boys at school wouldn't think it was quite as cool as what I did. So, that was, a life journey. But yeah, I just love to dance. And I guess ballet, because I saw some ballet on TV, which was Rudolf Nureyev doing Don Quixote with the Australian Ballet. And I went, Oh, that's the sort of dance I want to do. And then I went to a ballet school and 10 years later I was in Melbourne at the Australian Ballet School. And two years later I joined the company.\\n\\nI've got to say the first time I saw that portrait, I was just in awe really. I'd seen all of the preparatory work that Peter had done through his journals and diaries and things, and he talked a lot about it. So, I guess I knew that the dance element would be as it was, and it was incredibly beautiful. But I had no idea of what I'd look like. And it was really, really amazing. He caught a moment that sort of not, I guess what people would think necessarily is a former dancer and, a, you know, artistic director, because we tend to be on, you know, sort of like ‘Welcome to the ballet’. And it was sort of more of a pensive moment. And I really liked that ’cos, you know, I feel like it's the side of me that sometimes people don't get to see. And so it's beautiful that it's the side that he's shown.",

He moved at the age of four to Australia, where his parents worked as caterers on TV and movie sets. His big-screen debut came in _The Crossing_ (1990), in which he co–starred with future wife Danielle Spencer. He won AFI awards for his work in _Proof_ (1991) and _Romper Stomper_ (1992), and played Jack Thompson’s gay son in _The Sum of Us_ (1994). The following year he moved to Hollywood to make _The Quick and the Dead_ (1995); soon after, he drew rave reviews as the brooding Bud White in _LA Confidential_ (1997). _The Insider_ (1999), _Gladiator_ (2000), and _A Beautiful Mind_ (2001) earned him three consecutive Best Actor Oscar nominations; he won for _Gladiator_ (and took out the Golden Globe for _A Beautiful Mind_). Following the noble _Master and Commander_, Crowe dominated a series of tough action dramas, including _Cinderella Man_ (2004), _3:10 to Yuma_ (2007), _American Gangster_ (2007) and _Body of Lies_ (2008). He returned to historical costume for _Robin Hood_ (2010), _Les Misérables_ (2012) and the Biblical epic _Noah_ (2014) before the release of his directorial debut, _The Water Diviner_. His most recent role is as manipulative American media executive Roger Ailes in the miniseries _The Loudest Voice_ (2019). Part–owner of the South Sydney Rabbitohs since 2006, he commutes regularly between the USA, the north coast of NSW and Sydney. \\n\\nStuart Spence’s portrait of Crowe was shot in 1995 at Crowe’s local pub, located 300 metres from where he was living in Sydney at the time. Crowe commissioned the image himself, at a time when celebrities were encouraged to provide their own approved publicity material to the press. Spence had worked with Crowe previously on a magazine shoot where the pair had, in Spence’s words, ‘got on like a house on fire’. The portrait of the young actor swinging on his chair was taken around the time he made his debut in Hollywood, and his career could tip either way. Although he enjoyed photographing Crowe, himself, Spence said ‘Russell had a reputation at that time for doing some pretty left field things on photo shoots, to the point where many photographers were deeply on edge if they had to shoot him.’",

Apart from his flirty smile and sexy moustache, off the court Newcombe was known for enjoying and inciting beer-fuelled hijinks (his drinking bout with George Bush Jr. led to the future president's arrest for drunk driving). In 1994 he assumed the captaincy of Australia's Davis Cup team in partnership with Tony Roche, and became a mentor to a new generation of Australian players like Pat Rafter and Lleyton Hewitt. Having led the team to victory in 1999 against France, Newcombe stepped down from the captaincy. He continues to work as a commentator and after-dinner speaker.",

She was well-known on the Sydney post-war art scene and her portrait was painted by both Russell Drysdale and William Dobell. Dobell’s portrait of Olley, dressed in a gown fashioned from surplus wartime parachute silk, won the 1948 Archibald Prize. Olley held her first one-person show that year. It was a sell-out, and from that beginning, she held at least one solo exhibition annually. In 1991 she reprised her success of 43 years before, when a show of 35 of her intimate, brilliantly-coloured interiors and still lifes sold out again. The Art Gallery of New South Wales held a major retrospective show of her long career in 1996–1997. Her work is represented in the National Gallery of Australia; all State galleries; and numerous regional, corporate and private collections. In 1990, she endowed the Margaret Hannah Olley Art Trust, which has funded acquisitions by many Australian institutions including the National Portrait Gallery. Remaining one of Sydney’s most recognisable arts identities, Olley was again the subject of an Archibald Prize-winning portrait, this time by Ben Quilty, in 2011. She and Morley were introduced to each other by Barry Humphries, and became close friends.",

Sometimes it doesn’t come off immediately, sometimes it does, and this is a very satisfying thing. Other times I paint say for a whole day, and then leave it for several weeks; it might go on for months or even six weeks, taking out something, repainting again.\\n\\nI very rarely make a detailed sketch of what I intend to do. I might make little thumbnail notes but never very detailed, because I feel you kill the painting you want to do.\\n\\nPainting to me is like drawing; you draw with your brush or your palette knife, so whether one is using a paintbrush or watercolour or a pen, it’s all creative, and I never mind which medium I’m using.\\n\\nThe paintings I do are naturally things I – I’m inspired whether it’s the colour, the shape; it might be the colour of the skin of a native woman, it doesn’t matter.\\n\\nI can hear myself saying things that are so trite, and they’re not really how I want to say them. This is a dreadful thing for a painter. We say it in paint, otherwise we’d be a writer or perhaps a musician, who knows?",

A talented singer, in the early 1920s she travelled to southeast Asia and established a Performing Arts Academy in Shanghai. She married in England in 1929 and with her husband became co-director and designer for Pellier Ltd, a fashionable Mayfair dress salon. In 1949 she returned to Australia. After ten years of painting and exhibiting, she established a wallpaper business in Sydney. Finding the monochromatic, muted tonings that Australians favoured for interiors insufficiently vigorous to 'withstand modern living', she began producing vibrant oversized prints. The Broadhurst Design Collection had grown to some 800 patterns when Broadhurst was murdered in October 1977 (the case has never been solved). More than 500 examples have been revived by Signature Prints, a Sydney business marketing Broadhurst wallpaper, textiles and art, and the designs have been archived by the Powerhouse Museum.",

It measures: 36.1 cm by 28.5.\\n\\nMargaret stands at a table covered by beautifully presented food. She smiles directly at the camera from the corner of a warmly lit dining room. Behind her are floor to ceiling curtains, drawn closed, bearing a repeat print motif of a small blue flower on a beige background. \\n\\nAt a right angle to the curtain is a recessed pine cabinet with glass doors. Margaret stands in front of the cabinets four shelves displaying blue and white china plates and bowls. On our right, a speckled brown marble fireplace and perched on the mantle is an arrangement of apricot and white roses in a silver bowl. Above the mantelpiece and against the beige wall is a framed, bold, black and white abstract, geometric art-work. \\n\\nMargaret is a full-figured, short-haired, smiling middle-aged woman and she stands behind a table laden with delicious-looking food and snacks. \\n\\nShe has an oval shaped face with a warm, light complexion and laugh-lines around her eyes. Her thick, red hair parts across her forehead. Subtle makeup highlights her brown eyes and eyebrows and soft red lipstick rims her open-mouthed smile. \\n\\nShe wears a brown beaded necklace with a fan shaped black and gold statement pendant, it stands out against her plain, beige, short-sleeved top and tightly pleated, flared skirt. At waist level, and as if about to lift and offer it to us, she holds the rim of a large silver platter of fruit on the table in front of her. \\n\\nThe pale-wood table is laden with tiered, edible arrangements; devilled eggs, roast meat, vegetables, salad, cheeses, brandy snaps, pastries, cake and strawberries.\\n\\nAmongst the bounty of food there are flowers, a blue and white china tureen with its lid on, crystal wine glasses and a silver candelabra with three tall white unlit candles.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Annette Twyman and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

At sixteen she auditioned successfully for a role in the Australian production of the musical _Hair_, and has lived in this country ever since. (Auditioning the same week, her cousin, Donna Summer, scored a role in the German production of _Hair_.) In 1972 Hines began a two-year stint as Mary Magdalene in _Jesus Christ Superstar_ – of Jamaican heritage, she was the first black actress in the world to play the part. Two years later she embarked on a successful solo singing career that produced such hits as ‘I Just Don’t Know What to do With Myself, ‘You’ and ‘Something’s Missing in My Life’ and saw her crowned Australia’s Queen of Pop in 1976, 1977 and 1978. Hines had a seven-year run as the kindest of the judges on television’s _Australian Idol_ from 2003 to 2009. Her more than twenty albums include the recent _Life_ (2007), _Marcia Sings Tapestry_ (2010) and _Amazing_ (2014). Inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2007, from 2015 she appeared to sensational effect in a hit fringe stage production, _Velvet_, which she co-created. Over 2018 she is performing with other big names from the Australian music scene of the 1970s in the APIA Good Times Tour. \\n\\nLewis Morley (1925–2013), photographer, was born in Hong Kong and went to the United Kingdom with his family at the end of World War II. He went to art school in London and spent time in Paris before taking up photography in 1954, initially working for magazines like Tatler and She. In 1961, he founded Lewis Morley Studios and built his reputation through photographs of the celebrities that defined the hip spirit of London in the 1960s, but is perhaps most famous for his 1963 image of call-girl and model, Christine Keeler, taken at the height of the Profumo Affair. In the early 1970s he emigrated to Australia, and went on to take many photographs for Dolly, POL, Belle and other publications. The National Portrait Gallery, London, held a retrospective of his work in 1989; and the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra presented Lewis Morley: Myself and Eye, in 2003.",

With Roberts, McCubbin and Charles Conder, Streeton was a core member of the group of artists known as the 'Heidelberg School'. In 1897, after several years in Sydney, moved to London with the photographer Walter Barnett and his wife. Streeton spent most of the next 25 years in Europe, working for some time as an official Australian war artist in France, and serving alongside Roberts and other expatriate Australians in the Royal Army Medical Corps at the 3rd London General Hospital at Wandsworth. He married the Canadian violinist Nora Clench (1867–1938) in 1908. Barnett later photographed the couple at their St John's Wood home in England. Some years after the end of the war, in 1923, the Streetons returned to Australia, settling near Melbourne.",

Returning to Australia in 1931, she established a studio in Melbourne, producing pieces based on the simple lines of ancient Mediterranean art, and gained a reputation as a potent modern artist. Between 1938 and 1941 she made two huge figures for the Royal Hobart Hospital, a memorial fountain in Bendigo, panels for the Mutual Life and Citizen’s Building, Sydney, and a massive figure for the Pioneer Women’s Memorial in Adelaide. She then turned to teaching, while continuing to produce sculptures for churches.\\n\\nLate in her career Cohn made the Fairies Tree for Melbourne’s Fitzroy Gardens. She carved her fairy tree in a red gum over three years from 1931–34, as a gift to the children of Melbourne. Inspired by Ivor Innes’ Elfin Oak in Kensington Gardens, London, Cohn’s version includes fairies, dwarfs, angels, gnomes and Australian birds and animals. She inscribed the trunk with her intention to carve the tree ‘for the fairies and those who believe in them, for they will understand how necessary it is to have a fairy sanctuary – a place that is sacred and safe as a home should be to all living creatures’.",

Writer Ria Murch (1918–2014) worked as a cadet journalist at 2UE before joining the Sun newspaper. In 1940, the 22-year-old was writing a story about the Ballets Russes when she met Murch, who was drawing the dancers. The attraction was irresistible; they married in 1941 and moved to Mona Vale, where their first child was born. During the Second World War, Arthur was an official war artist, working in Darwin and around the Adelaide River. After his war service, they settled in Avalon, where they built a house together. In 1954, Ria returned to work, while Arthur looked after their two children. Both Ria and their children appear in Murch’s paintings.\\n\\nMargaret Michaelis photographed Arthur (in his army clothes) and Ria in 1945 at 4 Delwood Close, Mona Vale. Delwood Close runs off Waterview Street, dubbed the ‘mad half mile’ due to its concentration of artists, actors, writers and poets. In October 1947 an article about the area featured in the journal Australia, with photographs by Michaelis.",

I couldn’t do it now if I tried! And at that time, Dame Nellie Melba was visiting home and she saw this picture, and she thought it showed great talent and she’d wanted to give me something to remember her by and her recognition of me. And she gave me my first palette, and that started me off on oil painting, which I really wanted to do. And I’m still painting on this palette today.\\n\\nI like painting flowers direct. I like to gather a bunch in my hand in the garden, put them in a setting that enhances them, and to paint direct, to get the whole feeling of the bunch in the round.\\n\\nFlowers have always had that fascination for me, because I can remember when I was a war artist right up in the steaming jungle of New Guinea. I’d arranged myself a beautiful native bowl full of flowers and I was sitting in the mess, painting this, when I had a signal to be moved on down to Lae, and I ignored the signal, and the jeep came along to collect me to take me to the airport, and I said, ‘Go away, I’m in the middle of painting flowers’, and I continued with my flowers and got into hot water over this. The signals flew from New Guinea to Melbourne and back, and I was still painting my flowers, refusing to budge.\\n\\nI recall that picture and sticking it out, and I remember painting it on the mess table; I had to move every time a meal was brought forward, and it took me about four or five days to complete it, and I’ve kept that canvas, I called it _The Flower Sip_ and it’s one picture that didn’t go into the Military History Section. I felt I deserved that one.",

                    "transcript": "This photograph is titled Nora Heysen with her dog, sitting outside her home, Hunters Hill, Sydney and was taken of the painter by Sage, in 2000. The portrait is a gelatin silver photograph in sepia tones, measuring 25.5cm tall by 21cm wide.\\n\\nThe photograph reveals a few details of Nora Heysen’s home exterior. Nora is positioned a few metres from the viewer. Clouded eyes peer from a delicate face and her slight, ageing figure is bent in her chair. She holds a cigarette in one hand, her left foot rests lightly on the back of an elderly, black and white border collie-cross at her feet.\\n\\nBehind Nora, white, horizontal weatherboards rising up out of view and shimmering garden reflections in a four-pained glass window. On the windowsill, are a collection of ornaments, a candle the shape of a butternut pumpkin, a tall metal tea kettle. More things are arranged on a small wooden table to the right of the scene, inclusive of her ashtray. \\n\\nIn front of the side table, her dog, sitting upright on cement floor bearing signs of heavy use and on our right, so close to the foreground its edges blur, is the corner of a larger table covered in a white cloth.\\n\\nNora’s slight form is the centre of the image. Her head is at an angle, light washing out the left side of her face, lined skin on her right, caught by the light. Nora’s tall, white hair is swept untidily back from her face, sitting up high off her forehead, tucked behind her ears, fine wisps escaping. Her brow is raised, traversed by three deep lines, her short, shapely grey eyebrows slanting up. Nora’s eyes are deep-set, heavy lidded, gazing towards us. Two creases join her nose to the outer corners of her mouth. Her lips are closed, her jaw relaxed her expression unreadable. Nora’s light skin at her neck droops from beneath her chin into the open collar of her light coloured shirt.\\n\\nThe shirt, and all of Nora’s clothing is simple and loose fitting. Her dark waistcoat, in wide ribbed corduroy, is undone, three metallic buttons gleam, spaced along the left edge; at the hip is a pocket, with a pale triangle of fabric nosing out. Nora’s thin legs are encased in trousers of the same wide ribbed corduroy as the waistcoat, but in a lighter shade.\\n\\nNora is sitting on a folded crochet blanket on the seat of a plain, angular, wooden chair; its surface scratched and pitted, in patches, the dark varnish has worn away. Her shoulders are rounded forward, her body bowed to her right. Both elbows lean on either arm of the chair; her right arm propped up, with a smoldering cigarette held between her fore and middle fingers, while the left hand dangles towards her lap, palm down, fingers curled.\\n\\nNora’s knees are slightly apart and in its pale leather shoe, her left foot rests possessively on her chubby, tired dog’s thick black and white coat.\\n\\nThe collie is grey around its muzzle, eyes and ears. Its left eye is milky white, reflecting the light. The dog’s front legs are outstretched, white paws with black sleeves and it rests side on to Nora.\\n\\nRunning from the wall of the house in the back of the portrait, to the foreground, two black lines; joins in the precast concrete floor, frame Nora Heysen and her dog in the scene.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

Yvonne Lennie (1920–2013) studied at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, winning prizes for drawing, and met Arthur at an art class. They married in 1945, Yvonne first teaching art to supplement their income, then becoming Arthur’s business manager and mother to their three children.\\n\\nIn the early 1970s, the Boyds bought a property on the Shoalhaven River on the south coast of New South Wales, Bundanon, which means ‘deep valley’ in Dharawal language. Photographer Greg Weight took this informal kitchen portrait in the family homestead. The couple’s vision was for the property to ‘be accessible to any Australian whose life can be enriched by interaction with Australian creative artists’ – they gifted Bundanon to the Australian people in 1993",

But, I mean, you don’t ever come out with anything fresh or marvellous, it always seems ghastly when it goes up on the wall, and maybe it is.\\n\\nI hope it’s becoming less taped, or typed. Not meant to be a pun, but anyway, I think that’s what I’d prefer to be happening, that it’s becoming just as much mine, if I can make it that way, but much less typed in the sense that it would be, well, ‘that’s Australian’, or ‘that comes from Melbourne, that comes from Ballarat, that’s where …’. I’d like it to be much more a universal sort of thing. I don’t mean necessarily the painting to look as if it could be done anywhere, but just that it would be much more like good painting rather than like something that comes from somewhere.",

Australia's first Aboriginal pop star, Little made his recording debut in 1956. After a national number one hit, 'Royal Telephone', which sold over 75,000 copies, he became a household name and was named Pop Star of the Year in 1964. His profile continued to grow through TV appearances, radio airplay and regular tours around Australia. In the 1980s, Little began working at the Eora Centre in Redfern, becoming a role model and mentor for Indigenous youth. In a characteristically low-key resurgence, he won an ARIA Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album in 1999 for _Messenger_. The same year, he was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and was named Best Male Artist at the Deadly Awards. He founded the Jimmy Little Foundation in 2006 to improve renal health in Indigenous communities. Little won a Golden Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival in 2011.\\n\\nIn 2003 the National Portrait Gallery exhibited Juno Gemes' solo show _Proof: Portraits from the Movement 1978–2003_.

This work is one of a group commissioned by the Gallery for its 20th birthday in 2018. 'I wanted to keep the portrait very simple and honest,' Shakespeare said, 'reflecting the man of the land but very connected to home and family.'",

In 2017, she became only the second woman of colour to model bridal gowns for Chanel. The following year she featured in the Pirelli calendar, and made 33 appearances at Paris Fashion Week. She was selected by the Duchess of Sussex to feature in British _Vogue’s_ 'Forces for Change' edition in 2019, which profiled her activism on humanitarian issues, the rights of asylum seekers, and racial and gender equality. \\n\\nCharles Dennington's portrait of Akech was originally taken for the December 2018 issue of _Vogue Australia_. Dennington discussed plans for the shoot with Akech in advance, giving him a deeper insight into the model's personal life. This portrait of Akech with her siblings Kim, Yar, Bior and Alakiir is one of a group of images that present a funky and upbeat glimpse of the Sudanese–Australian model and her family at home in Adelaide.",

                    "transcript": "The photographic portrait is of South Sudanese-Australian model Adut Akech with siblings Kim, Yar, Bior and Alakiir. It was taken by Charles Dennington in 2018. It is a black and white inkjet print on paper, measuring about 33 cm tall by 44 cm wide. The photograph is surrounded by a wide white mounting and slender dark wood frame. \\n\\nThe photograph is in landscape orientation, offering a wide view of the Akech siblings. A corrugated metal fence takes up the top half of the scene and long drying grasses fill the lower half. \\n\\nThe top left corner of the portrait is in dark shade. The rest is bathed in bright sunlight. The fence of pale steel runs from the upper left corner in a shallow diagonal, down across the background. \\n\\nGoing from left to right, Kim, Adut, Yar and Alakiir recline on sun lounges. Brother Bior, a crown on his head, pops up from behind Yar’s lounge, the second from the right.\\n\\nThe family are posed on retro-style, woven plastic sun lounges. The lounges’ legs are obscured by, and they seem to float on top of, long coarse straw-like grass.\\n\\nKim sits in the leftmost lounge. Her hair is braided in cornrows and knotted in a ponytail on top of her head, the intricate braids draping over her shoulder. Angular cats-eye sunglasses shade her eyes, and her lips are partially open. She wears a light-toned t-shirt, its lettering obscured by loose folds, and holds a small Just Juice popper in her right hand. Her trousers are pale with a wide check pattern and elastic cuffs, and on her feet are bright white pool slides. Her left leg is bent and she rests her left hand just above her knee. \\n\\nAdut reclines to Kim’s right. She has close-cropped hair and looks up at us over her white-rimmed sunglasses. Her mouth is slightly open in a rosebud pout, her chin tilted down. She wears a bright white-toned dress with tight structured bodice and loose flowing skirt. The skirt is cast aside to show her long bare legs extended on the sun lounge. Her feet are clad in patent leather ankle boots with stiletto heels. \\n\\nYar looks like the youngest smallest sibling, with her head only reaching part way up against her lounge. Her hair is gathered in two bunches of tight curls atop her head. She looks directly towards us as she sips from a juice cup accessorised with a cocktail palm tree and umbrella. Yar wears one-piece swimmers patterned with a pineapple design and her feet are bare.\\n\\nPopping up from behind the headrest of Yar’s lounge, Bior is also gazing into the camera, lips closed. A large crown of printed fabric perches on his head.\\n\\nAlakiir is on the far right of the portrait. She also peers over her sunglasses towards us, sipping juice from a glass through a spiral straw. Alakiir is wearing a gingham-patterned top, tight, long-sleeved and cropped below the bust. Beneath this she has on one-piece swimmers with a bold light and dark toned pattern. Her bare legs stretch almost to end of the lounge and her bare feet cross at the ankles.\\n\\nAudio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Ellie Brotchie",

His early plays premiered at alternative theatres in Melbourne – _The Coming of Stork_ (1970) and _The Removalists_ (1971) at Betty Burstall’s La Mama, and _Don’s Party_ (1971) at the Pram Factory in Carlton, home to the Australian Performing Group. Later, Williamson based himself in Sydney, recalling his Melbourne experiences as unhappy. From the outset, Williamson aimed to ‘get our own stories on stage, spoken in our own accents, reflecting our own life’. His plays, many of which he has scripted for films, include _The Department_, _The Club_, _Travelling North_, _The Perfectionist_, _Emerald City_, _Brilliant Lies_, _Dead White Males_, _Heretic_ and _Up for Grabs_. His film credits include _Stork_ (1971), _Petersen_ (1974), _Gallipoli_ (1980), _The Year of Living Dangerously_ (1981) (the latter two collaborations with Peter Weir), _Phar Lap_ (1982) and _On the Beach_ (2000). Critics have carped about his works as they have accreted, but for decades he has been Australia’s best-known and most prolific playwright and he is unlikely to be eclipsed as the writer of many of the top box-office performers in Australian theatre history. \\n\\nGordon Glenn (b. 1948) worked as an assistant cameraman on the television show _Homicide_ before becoming the stills photographer for the pioneering Australian journal _Cinema Papers_. He worked for the magazine from 1968 to the mid-70s, documenting production on the sets of films such as _The Cars that Ate Paris_, _Between Wars_, _The True Story of Eskimo Nell_, _Caddie_, _Mad Dog Morgan_, _Don’s Party_, and _The Picture Show Man_. He worked as a cinematographer on a number of independent films before moving to directing and producing feature films and television specials. In 2001 he produced the highly-acclaimed feature film _Yolngu Boy_ (2001). This photograph accompanied an interview with Williamson in _Cinema Papers_ of January 1974.",

                    "transcript": "By the time I finish a play now, it’s usually fairly close to what’s performed, there’s not much alteration now. I think I know what I’m doing now.\\n\\nI basically start from a situation and the characters in the situation. My plays are plays about character rather than plays about theme. I don’t start off with a thesis and construct a play around that thesis, I start off with characters and try and follow the logical paths that those characters would follow in the play. So, sometimes I start with an outline. _What If You Died Tomorrow?_ started with a fairly close three-page outline. Sometimes, I – as in _The Removalists_ – I start from the situation and see where that situation leads. _The Department_: the very first rough draft started from a listing of the topics on the agenda. The latest play, _A Handful of Friends_, started from an initial scene. So, I haven’t got a clear-cut way of going about it, except that the first draft is invariably the biro-written one, very very rough and I expect it to be. I’d rather be fluent and let it all come out in that first draft and then refine and refine later on.\\n\\nWhen you’re writing from character, some of it’s intuitive. You just feel I know, I know my character well enough now, I know what he’ll do in a situation, I know how he’ll react. You keep referring back to reality to try and get a check on the types of behaviour, you say, ‘Now when I was in that situation, or when Fred was in that situation, what sort of way did they react to this?’, and so you keep referring back, but essentially, once your characters are under way, you just intuitively feel them and what they’ll do.\\n\\nSometimes the structure grows, I suppose the word is ‘organically’.\\n\\nI love watching political processes at work, I really love watching power struggles and the way people use language as an instrument of power, as an instrument to gain power, prestige, status, love, whatever they want out of life. I’m primarily interested in the way people relate to each other and use language to do it.",

After graduating he went overseas, spending two years working as an editor in Nigeria before returning to London and a role with the British Film Institute. His first feature films _The Adventures of Barry McKenzie_ (1972) and _Barry McKenzie Holds his Own_ (1974) – both collaborations with Barry Humphries – achieved box-office success but were sourly received by critics. Regardless, they signalled Beresford’s emergence as a key figure in Australia's film renaissance, and he then cemented his standing with _Don's Party_ (1976), _The Getting of Wisdom_ (1977), _Breaker Morant_ (1980), _The Club_ (1980) and _Puberty Blues_ (1981). His debut Hollywood feature, _Tender Mercies_ (1983) earned him an Oscar nomination for best director. His 1989 film _Driving Miss Daisy_ won four Academy Awards, including best picture – although Beresford himself was overlooked for nomination in the direction category. Subsequent projects include the films _Black Robe_ (1991); _Last Dance_ (1996); _Paradise Road_ (1997); _Mao’s Last Dancer_ (2009) and _Ladies in Black_ (2018), and the TV miniseries _Bonnie and Clyde_ (2013) and _Roots_ (2016).",

She became a member of Brisbane's literary circle, joining the writers' group 'Barjai' which included Judith Wright and Thea Astley. In 1950 she was diagnosed with optic atrophy; she was declared blind by the age of 22. Moving to Sydney to study, she met artist Charles Blackman. After they married in 1952, they moved to Melbourne, where Blackman associated with the avant-garde group centered around the Melbourne Contemporary Art Society, including Arthur Boyd, Fred Williams, Joy Hester, John and Sunday Reed, Clifton Pugh, John Perceval and Leonard French. In the 1960s the Blackmans were part of the Australian push active in London. While muse to her husband, Blackman also worked as a magazine columnist, a radio-producer for Radio for the Print-Handicapped, and an interviewer for the National Library's oral history program. Blackman published her autobiography Glass after Glass in 1997, and Portrait of a Friendship, which drew on her correspondence with Judith Wright, in 2007. In between, she purchased her husband's painting The Family, showing her 'good dear beloved long friend' Judith Wright, for the National Portrait Gallery.",

But somehow what his creations came out of – a sort of a living or understanding of poetry – was something that always bound us and still binds us together. But at that time when I recognised Charles as potentially a very great painter and a great creator, I relinquished my strong intentions of being a writer and although I went on writing diaries and sometimes poems and more and more I became a very prolific letter-writer as I gathered more and more interesting people as friends and we became more and more separated by distance, my writing changed course, as in fact my life had changed course to become devoted to Charles’ optimal putting forward of himself as a painter.\\n\\nYou know, when we married I said, ‘Well if you’re going to be a painter, you’re going to paint, you’re not going to go out and get a job doing something or another,’ so he stayed home and painted. And by this time my eyesight had failed almost altogether and I was on a blind pension, so we had that as a basis to live on. And the only thing I could really do was to work as an artist’s model, as a nude model, which in fact I quite enjoyed because I was picking up a lot of information about painting. It’s quite an elegant job in its way, being a model, because one can decide one’s own poses and it’s a very private occupation. One can have one’s own thoughts and one has the satisfaction of knowing one’s doing a job well.",

The son of a country policeman, Brown studied medicine at Sydney University and in 1972 moved to Tasmania, where he worked as a general practitioner in Launceston. His passion for the Tasmanian wilderness was sparked by a rafting trip down the Franklin River in 1976, the same year that he became a founding member of the Wilderness Society. From then until 1983 he famously led the campaign against proposed dam-works on the Franklin, during which he was arrested and gaoled. The river was subsequently preserved with a World Heritage Listing. In 1983, he began a decade in the Tasmanian House of Assembly as the Member for Denison. He was elected to the Federal Senate as a member of the Tasmanian Greens in 1996 and later joined West Australian Greens Senator Dee Margetts in founding the Australian Greens. At the 2001 Federal election Brown was re-elected to the Senate with a greatly increased vote. By the time he retired from politics in April 2012, he had overseen the emergence of the Greens from a fringe to a mainstream political force. Brown remains one of the most-recognised Australian political figures, known for his outspokenness on the environment as well as human rights and social justice issues. His memoir _Memo for a saner world_ was published in 2004.",

Making many key images exploring women’s everyday lives and the politics of representation in the 1970s, during the late 1980s Ford became increasingly interested in indigenous issues, race, representation and colonisation. \\n\\nIn 1988, Sue Ford attended the Barunga festival of culture and sports. The then prime minister, Bob Hawke, and Aboriginal affairs minister Gerry Hand visited the festival to meet with senior Aboriginal men. They included Gamatj clan leader Yunupiŋu AM (1948-2023), who had known Hawke for years. Yunupiŋu had helped his father, Mungurrawuy Yunupiŋu, draft the famous Bark Petition of 1963 to Federal Parliament, launching the first native title case in Australia. In 1968 when the Yolgnu obtained writs against Nabalco Corporation, Yunupiŋu acted as court interpreter in the Gove Land Case. He became chairman of the Northern Land Council in 1977 and was the key negotiator for the Mirrar people in the Ranger uranium mine deal, securing the lease for Kakadu National Park in November 1978. For this he was named Australian of the Year for 1978 (his brother, Mandawuy Yunupiŋu AC, was Australian of the Year for 1993). With other senior Aboriginal leaders including Wenten Rubuntja, in 1988 he drew up and presented to Bob Hawke another bark petition – the Barunga Statement, bearing a written proposal for Aboriginal self-determination. Hawke hung it in Parliament House on his last day in office. Yunupiŋu's is the voice chanting in Yolngu-Matha language on the hit song 'Treaty', an attempt to hold the government to account over its promise for a treaty by 1990. There are photographs of Yunupiŋu at separate meetings over decades with Malcolm Fraser, Paul Keating, Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott. He wrote a brilliant if dispiriting essay, 'Tradition, Truth and Tomorrow' for the _Monthly_ magazine of December-January 2008-2009, recounting the meeting with Hawke, other such 'historic' meetings, and their negligible outcomes.",

Graduating in architecture from the University of New South Wales, he completed a masters degree in town planning at London’s University College in 1977. After working as the principal architect for the Department of Housing and Construction from 1968–85, Johnson was a director at Denton, Cork and Marshall until 2000, when he co-founded JPW.\\n\\nIngvar Kenne’s photograph is from a series of portraits of the six directors of JPW in the Gordon Darling Hall – the first commissioned portraits taken in the Gallery. Of the suite of portraits, Kenne said: ‘We wanted to convey the transformation of a space during a day and night and incorporate the portrait of each architect. Each one of [the directors of JPW] was asked to turn up in the clothes they wanted to wear and where they appeared in the frame was dictated by the moment rather than being planned. We were excited having the opportunity to photograph them in the space they designed.’",

Giurgola studied in his native Italy before moving to the USA where he held academic positions at Cornell and Columbia universities, and in 1958 co-founded Mitchell/Giurgola Architects in Philadelphia. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the American Society of Architects in 1982, while work on the new Parliament House was under way. In 1988 Giurgola settled in Canberra, designing a tiny Catholic church in Charnwood and a home for himself at Lake Bathurst, near Goulburn; both are represented in Mandy Martin’s painting.\\n\\nThe architect and artist had known each other for many years when this portrait was made. It is unconventional in that Giurgola appears small scale amid a melding of the internal architectural space of Parliament House and the surrounding landscape. This depiction echoed Giurgola’s design ethos that ‘the building should nest with the hill, symbolically rise out of the Australian landscape, as true democracy rises from the state of things’.",

Settling in Melbourne, he opened a workshop in St Kilda, and rapidly established a reputation for the superb construction of his custom-made modern furniture. Credited with elevating his craft to the level of an art, he was the subject of several one-man exhibitions in his lifetime, and his work now figures in the permanent collections of several major Australian galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of South Australia and the Powerhouse Museum. His woodwork adorns the chapel of St Mary's college at the University of Melbourne.",

By 1967, he was in a position to open the Joseph Brown Gallery in Collins Street, Melbourne, at which he frequently showed mixed exhibitions of contemporary Australian art. Over time, Brown built up one of the finest private art collections in Australia, and made such substantial contributions to Australian art history that he was awarded three honorary doctorates. In 2004 the National Gallery of Victoria accepted Brown's gift of some 160 works from his collection, valued at $35 million; two hundred more works, of similar value, were auctioned.",

Of Dunghutti descent, they were born at Burnt Ridge, near Kempsey, and took up boxing in emulation of their father, grandfather and a great-uncle, who'd had some success as fighters. They adopted the surname Sands as a tribute to a local boxing fan and railway worker who'd allowed Percy (1921–1974) – who boxed under the name Ritchie Sands – to jump a train to a fight in Newcastle in 1939. The brothers claimed numerous victories in a period spanning 20 years, notching up 607 bouts between them and winning a third of that total by knockout. Clem (1917–1989) held the NSW welterweight title from 1947 to 1951; Alfie (1929–1985) was the NSW middleweight champion from 1952 to 1954; while George (1924–1986) won 55 of his 101 fights. The most successful of the sextet, Dave (1926-1952), claimed his first belts in 1946, winning the Australian middleweight and light heavyweight titles. He took out the British Empire middleweight boxing title in 1949; and in 1950 held the Australian middle, light heavyweight and heavyweight titles simultaneously. In all, Dave won 97 of his 110 professional bouts and at the time of his death, aged 26, was ranked number three in the world. Dave's death inspired the youngest brother, Russell (1937-1977) to succeed in the ring. He won the state and national featherweight titles in 1954 and retired in 1959 having won 35 of his 58 fights.",

A world and Australian spearfishing champion, Ron gave the sport away on realising that photographing sharks was a vastly more rewarding pursuit than killing them. He and Valerie, also a winner of several Australian spearfishing and scuba titles, met in the late 1950s and married in 1963, by which time their first major documentary _The Shark Hunters_ had been sold to Australian and American television. They formed their own production company in 1969, the year they were consultants for the US feature film _Blue Water, White Death_. Throughout the 70s, 80s and 90s they created footage for numerous films and television programs, including the live shark underwater scenes for the Steven Spielberg blockbuster _Jaws_ (1975). Vigorous and successful campaigners for marine conservation, they received many prestigious awards for their environmental work and underwater photography, their images appearing in magazines such as _National Geographic_ and _Time_. Valerie's work continued following her husband's death from cancer in 2012.\\n\\nThis photograph is thought to have been taken near Norfolk Island by the skipper of the boat on which the couple is pictured.",

The only Australian to win gold on the track at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games (with four medals), she lit the flame at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Paralympic Games in 2000, and went on to win two gold medals and one silver. She also won gold in demonstration events at the Atlanta and Sydney Olympics. She has set five world records and gained eleven world championships, and won the women's wheelchair division of the Boston Marathon four times. Sauvage was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2007, Australian Paralympic Hall of Fame in 2011 and named a Sport Australia Hall of Fame Legend in 2019. Now a sports coach and motivational speaker, Sauvage stresses that 'you never know what you can achieve until you try'.\\n\\nCanadian-born team Denis Montalbetti and Gay Campbell are renowned for their portraiture, particularly their photographs of athletes.

In 1972 she became the first woman presenter on _Four Corners_ – an appointment which made headlines and prompted offensive, patronising commentary on matters including her looks, marital status and tastes in interior decoration. She remained with _Four Corners_ for nine years during which she was also a presenter on ABC radio's _City Extra_. From 1987 to 1994 she presented _The Search for Meaning_ on Radio National, conducting many of the insightful and tactful interviews for which she became renowned and which resulted in the publication of four volumes of transcripts. For twenty years from 1996 she presented the weekly biographical television show _Australian Story_. A foundation member of the Australia Council for the Arts, she was a Reconciliation Ambassador for the Aboriginal Council for Reconciliation from 1998. Her book _An Authentic Life: Finding Meaning and Spirituality in Everyday Life_ (1998) was an Australian bestseller; and in 2009 she published _Through a Glass Darkly_, a powerful chronicle of her experience of the death of her father. She was a patron of the national mentoring and networking initiative, Women in Media, and many prominent Australian female journalists cite Jones as a role model and inspiration. Jones was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1988, won the Walkley Award for Outstanding Contribution to Journalism in 2013, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Sydney in 2017.\\n\\nDavid Campbell grew up on the New South Wales Central Coast and studied at the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education in Sydney in the 1970s. He only ever painted three portraits, each of which were Archibald finalists. His portrait of Jones resulted from many hours of studying and sketching her at work in the ABC studios and was a finalist in 1979. That year, when 22 windows of the Myer store in Sydney were filled with his abstract paintings, this portrait of Jones was among them.",

From his work as a barrister and his appointment as the 31st Governor of Western Australia to his leadership and philanthropic endeavours, McCusker has demonstrated a deep and ongoing commitment to Australia, and not least his home state. In 2012 he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia, for eminent service to the people of Western Australia, particularly through the provision of equitable access to legal representation, as an advocate for sustainable development and education, and through significant philanthropic support for a range of medical research, youth and arts organisations.\\n\\nIn this painting, artist Vincent Fantauzzo has employed his signature intricate realism, combined with a gentle palette grounded in blue, to create a portrait that captures a strong sense of the sitter’s steady optimism, inextricably linked to his beloved hometown of Perth.",

And with cooking, you're doing the same thing; you're mucking around with form, texture, colour and shape.\\n\\nI started writing for television when television started. I noticed that the bloke in front of the camera got more money than the poor bugger that wrote the scripts. And so I decided to go from behind the camera to the front of the camera. I then realised that there were too many policemen on television and all sorts of other people that seemed to know what they were doing but there were no cooks. And a cook is what I am. I started cooking on television and the ABC said: no one will be interested. We did 900 shows before the ABC got bored.\\n\\nCooking is only supplying heat to food. The same as painting. Painting is supplying paint to a surface, whether it's a canvas or a piece of cardboard.\\n\\nDo what you want to do. Do what you think is right. And then you'll create your own style, and your own imagination, because cooking is not following a recipe book. Cooking is your imagination and painting is your imagination. So make sure you think about what you're doing.",

But after that period, I started to do performance pieces. My photography changed a bit because one of the things that I undertook was to photograph my own family which represented the Chinese in Australia. I claimed my heritage in the 80s because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged.\\n\\nAnd the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields in the place where my uncle had been shot. I somehow knew that this was an important event because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event. And that was a very important moment in my life. I kept doing self-portraits and I’ve done about 40 of them.\\n\\nGradually I evolved to tell my own story and just photograph things about my own life. I’m very happy that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so I feel that I’m living my art as well as my life. And so that’s very satisfying for me.\\n\\nI had to come to terms with being Chinese, being gay and just feeling comfortable as a human being. There are lots of people who aren’t comfortable about that, still. And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. That’s been my philosophy.",

It measures 108.5 cm high and 72.5 cm wide, with a 10 cm thick white picture mat and a thin pale wooden frame. \\n\\nA young black-haired boy stands posing, facing the camera open-mouthed with teeth exposed at the point of offering a smile. His whole body is in the frame, one arm up on his hip, the other resting on the handlebars of a small children’s metal bike.\\n\\nThere is little fine detail in the photograph due to its graininess and its age. He stands on dark floorboards in front of some textured draped curtains. \\n\\nThe boy wears a white high-collared short-sleeved shirt with a knotted tie that has a blurred indecipherable symbol on its tip. His shirt tucks into white shorts which is held in place by a white belt. His knees are bare. He wears white socks and black gym shoes.\\n\\nFilling the surface of the boy’s shirt and shorts is a handwritten passage in black ink. It begins at the collar, words curving to the collar’s rounded shape. As each written line progresses, it widens out, following this same curve. The lines of text straighten out by the time the words travel over the boy’s shorts.\\n\\nThe text passage is broken up by the blurred symbol on the boy’s tie and lower down, words curve in and around where his small hand grasps the bike’s handlebars, near his hip.\\n\\nIn neat cursive hand the text reads: ‘When I was about six years old one of the kids at school called me \"Ching Chong China man, born in a jar, Christened in a teapot, Ha Ha Ha. I had no idea what he was talking about but I knew from his expression that he was being horrible to me, so I went home to my mother and I said to her, \"Mum I’m not Chinese, am I?\" My mother said to me very sternly, \"Yes you are.\" Her tone was hard and it shocked me. I knew in this moment being Chinese was like a terrible curse and I could not rely on my mother for help. Or my brother who was four years older than me, very much more experienced in the world. He chimed in, \"And you better get used to it.\"\\n\\nThe words come to an end 2 inches before the hem of his shorts.\\n\\nAt the cuff of the boy’s right short pant is a small purple ink stamp with neatly rendered Chinese characters inside a thin purple square. On the cuff of the boy’s left short pant is written \"Self Portrait #2\" and in smaller handwriting, ‘Photographer Unknown. William Yang. 1947.’, and in even smaller print underneath, ‘2007, 5/30’.\\n\\nAudio description written and voiced by Kate Matthews",

Self Portrait #5 fits\\n\\ninto a larger body of photographic work that is characterised by the \\n\\nuse of text inscriptions and essentially traces a man rediscovering \\n\\nhimself. Oscillating between the public and private realms of Yang’s \\n\\nlife, this self portrait speaks to the inherent value and power of lived\\n\\nexperiences. Through the combination of visual and oral narratives, the\\n\\nwork reflects the artist’s self-acceptance and acknowledgment of \\n\\nculture, heritage and celebration of self.",

But after that period, I started to do performance pieces. My photography changed a bit because one of the things that I undertook was to photograph my own family which represented the Chinese in Australia. I claimed my heritage in the 80s because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged.\\n\\nAnd the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields in the place where my uncle had been shot. I somehow knew that this was an important event because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event. And that was a very important moment in my life. I kept doing self-portraits and I’ve done about 40 of them.\\n\\nGradually I evolved to tell my own story and just photograph things about my own life. I’m very happy that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so I feel that I’m living my art as well as my life. And so that’s very satisfying for me.\\n\\nI had to come to terms with being Chinese, being gay and just feeling comfortable as a human being. There are lots of people who aren’t comfortable about that, still. And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. That’s been my philosophy.",

I think it’s answering an inner compulsion, because if I didn’t find this particular form of activity – to me it’s one that is defining things to myself and defining myself – I’m not quite sure what would happen to me if I didn’t answer this kind of inner compulsion. And I suppose it relates to one’s attitude to life. I think that, despite all the negative and destructive powers that are constantly at work with us, that one is constantly striving to affirm life, to be in love with it, and these are the tokens of affection on our way, as it were.\\n\\nThe question of why I paint the particular things I do is also pretty ambiguous. I think I would say that I’m trying to exorcise my own particular devils, and I suppose some of them get into the painting. I hope they do, that’s where I’m trying to put them, and get rid of them.\\n\\nBut once out, of course, one can then feel this kind of relaxation, the affirmation flows in, and the devils in the painting can sometimes turn into angels.\\n\\nI suppose in the act of work that it is essentially a struggle to escape the enmeshment of one’s ego, and in the attempt to struggle free one seems externally, to the external world, to be a very egocentric person, because you’re following a necessary compulsion without which one loses one’s own balance and direction in life; and in the act of working one is defining these shapes, ejecting them as it were, and getting rid of them; and this process of ejectment is one there which is defining and clarifying one’s own particular kind of energy which you are attempting to flow out into life.",

Deeply interested in psychology, he wrote poetry, essays and books, and was a tireless supporter of Australian modern art. As a child he lived at Gosford on the NSW central coast and much of his work has been inspired by rock pools, full of ‘biomorphic forms’. For Gleeson the littoral zone where sea meets land was a powerful metaphor for the interplay of the conscious and unconscious mind and the fluid nature of existence. This can be seen in Gleeson’s study for his enormous painting Portrait of the artist as an evolving landscape, which was a 1994 Archibald Prize finalist. In the surreal composition, the artist’s fragmented face materialises out of the drawing. Gleeson reflected that ‘One of the most important and constantly recurring motifs throughout my work is based on a sense of the mutability of all forms and substances. Metamorphosis has always been, for me, one of the basic facts of life. Everything takes on a form, changes, falls apart and reforms in new organisations in an endless cycle.’",

With this new vision of what reality could mean, I began to become really seriously interested in art.\\n\\nThat was my first real understanding of the significance of art as a way of coming to grips with life, of understanding life; and that I think is the essential meaning of art. I don’t feel it’s a way of decorating a room, certainly not for an artist at any rate, it’s a way of coming to grips with reality, a way of getting to know what you yourself are like or what the world around you is like. And it seemed to me that surrealism, as a theory at any rate, offered enormous scope, and I felt that with the Surrealists, that the world of seeming – of things as they seem to be – was not the true world at all; that in the subconscious mind there were all sorts of images, ideas which were a part of reality, and, as a painter, I tried to express this subconscious material, or some of the images from it, at any rate.",

I’ve always understood, basically, that I used to be something else, that I’m a continuation of a particular kind of thread of human spirit, that the only thing that I’m involved in is the notion of interpreting time, in a sense that I’m alive. That the spirit will continue and it’ll be the same as what it was, and various painters have given their flash at it and that in a summary is basically what I’m doing. Along with that, is like, the immense sense of the requirement towards survival so one gets more interested in the capacity for power, or in the various ways that can be appropriated. And that art has to follow that, has to employ it, if it’s of any value.\\n\\nThere’s no such a thing as Australian art because there’s probably no such a thing as Australia. There’s a kind of ancient piece of immense and interesting and very strange land, which has had a few people come down on it and in a very surreal way started a kind of sensual civilisation. It’s got to a kind of point where we’re suffering like the rest of the world with a kind of paralysis of confidence.\\n\\nI think that humankind are trying to force and press open a new area of brain think – a capacity to sense, a broader knowing. In order to do that we’re going to have in God’s, or in the puzzle’s term, some sort of a major reckoning up. We’ve got death absolutely in our hands, a complete capacity to bang it out, and we’re trying to force open this newer channel. I see, to a certain degree, that I along with numbers of other individuals, are trying to, you know, cause inside their own pressure, that breaking through, that kind of time. I mean, there’s immense relaxation inside it, but there’s also like the heat towards want, the necessity of the mystery of life, of the system of life, which is always, like, come and go. (Laughs)",

One must always leave – I at least must always leave – a certain element of ambiguity which appears in the work in mental process while you’re at work. I love working from life, life drawings – I do quite a number, and my life drawings very often don’t have any close relationship to the work I’m doing based on those drawings. My subject matter is a very varied one, for the very reason that I consider art an adventure and any path I have trodden before seems to me very often used up, and I need to find a different stimulus and a different subject or combination of ideas.\\n\\nThe actual painting of a picture doesn’t take long.

After studying in Melbourne and winning many prizes and grants, from 1975 to 1983 he produced a series of cartoons attacking the Fraser government. After 1983 he began to paint more personal and emotionally-charged works, often incorporating a haunting ‘solitary watcher’. Some of his paintings of suburban and inner Melbourne now number amongst the defining images of the city. He is a regular exhibitor in the Wynne and Sulman Prizes, as well as the Archibald, in which he was a finalist nine times between 1976 and 2005. During the 1990s Amor was awarded several art residencies and worked in Barcelona, New York and London. In 1999, appointed Australia’s first official war artist since Vietnam, he travelled to East Timor to record the reconstruction efforts of peacekeepers. The resulting works are in the collection of the Australian War Memorial. Although he describes himself as an amateur sculptor, his disturbing black dog has crouched outside the National Gallery of Australia since 2004, and he won the $100 000 McClelland Sculpture Prize in late 2007. Amor has painted scientist Peter Doherty and governor-general Peter Cosgrove on commission for the National Portrait Gallery, which mounted the exhibition Rick Amor: 21 Portraits in 2014–2015.",

After returning home she taught ceramics, drawing and printmaking in Launceston, and made a number of self portraits in etching and woodcut. Moving to Melbourne, she taught at the National Gallery of Victoria School and in her practice – inspired by Andy Warhol and others – she became increasingly interested in photographic processes such as photo-screenprinting and photo-etching. From 1979 to 1980 she made a large wax-coated collage of embossed hand-made paper words on commission for the new High Court in Canberra. Following the loss of her home and studio in the Ash Wednesday fires in early 1983, she went back to Tasmania. In all, between 1964 and 2006, Maddock held more than 40 solo exhibitions and her work was included in over 70 Australian and international group shows. From 1993 to 1998 she worked on _Terra Spiritus: With a Darker Shade of Pale_, a monumental 52-sheet panorama of the entire coastline of Tasmania made from ochre pigment she sourced and ground herself, and featuring placenames in local First Nations languages in refutation of the colonial notion of _terra nullius_ – uninhabited land.",

After studying in Paris, first at the Académie Montmarte under Fernand Léger and later at La Grande Chaumière, he developed a hyper-real style with suggestions of surrealism. Over many decades, his paintings explored images of people dwarfed by the strong, simple shapes of man-made structures in urban environments. He painted several self-portraits; this drawing relates to a small one included in Philip Bacon’s highly successful 2001 exhibition of the artist’s paintings. From 1963, Smart lived in Arezzo, Tuscany. In 1996, he published Not Quite Straight - A Memoir, a vivid series of snapshots of his transformation from Adelaide art teacher to successful artist and Tuscan signore. Remaining lucid, he kept painting almost until the end of his life.",

After becoming associated with the modernist art patrons John and Sunday Reed, he made the complex series of paintings of Ned Kelly for which he is best known at their home Heide between 1945 and 1947. From 1950 Nolan lived abroad, but returned to Australia at regular intervals and continued to explore Australian themes and landscapes. A major retrospective of his work, _Sidney Nolan – A New Retrospective_, held at the Art Gallery of NSW in 2007, brought together more than 100 of his works. \\n\\nNolan painted a number of self portraits, beginning early in his career. The merged inky blues, pinks and subtle greys of this example are characteristic of the artist's late style. While there is a trace of a satisfied smile, the face is elusive, hazy, veiled, with the head apparently oscillating between profile and three-quarter view. Ultimately, the painting is ambiguous, seeming, like all Nolan's self portraits, to allude simultaneously to his public persona and his internal imagination – to both the mask, and the inner poetry of the artist.",

If you grew another arm, you know, you hope it would look like a painting, or anyway, put it this way: a painting sometimes feels like an extension of yourself.\\n\\nAnd I believe, in the past, that Chinese artists working some of their bamboo paintings, would put their fingers right into the brush, into bristles of the brush, and work there in order to feel this kind of electric thing flowing through them; that they want to get as close as possible to the ink. I think it’s something to do with growth, that this is one of the things that’s at you.\\n\\nAnd … the other obsession, or compulsion in a way, is that the growth shall be something that other people can recognise, that it’s got a meaning for them. And I think this is the kind of rather knife-edge thing that painters are on; that they want to produce something out of themselves but they want it to be something that other people will recognise. I mean, it’s almost as if, I suppose – although one hesitates to use the image – but if you produced a child and nobody liked it or recognised it or anything else. You not only produce it, but you want it to be part of the common experience and to be recognised as such.\\n\\nAnd I think in Australia now … is probably this rather wonderful position where all this is coming together. You don’t produce things out of your own compulsions to find that they fall on stony ground. It’s now beginning that you’re getting a response, and this of course enables you to produce more and more and make it richer and richer.\\n\\nAnd it seems to me that young painters now, here in Australia, are just at the moment when they can kind of have full confidence that whatever they produce honestly will meet with the recognition, and from this moment on you get back to what you got in Italy and Spain and all these things; you get the community and the art matching each other.",

                    "transcript": "A self portrait of artist Sidney Nolan, created in 1988. Oil on composition board measuring 121 centimetres in height and 91 centimetres in length.\\n\\nThe frame is a warm gold with soft pink textured strokes worked in. The portrait focuses on Nolan’s head and upper torso and the use of colour with blue tones, blushing pinks and subtle greys unifies the background and figure. Large brush marks create texture in the otherwise flat blue and grey toned background. This contrasts with the figure where the artist has applied the paint with his fingers, and the white surface of the board is revealed in sections.\\n\\nNolan is unclothed, painted in an abstract style with colours alternating between fleshy pink tones and a bruisy blue. His head is a bulbous oval, the back of the head carries the shape of his mid-length wispy hair and is rendered in smudged finger marks. His face is ambiguous, with a sense of being both in profile and in three-quarter view. A set of round glasses perch on the bridge of his nose which is in profile. Playing around with perspective, the glasses are shown in three-quarter view as if he was turning towards us. His left eye is blurred, disguised by the frames. His lips are in profile view, stained a deep blue and heavily smudged with finger marks dragged through the paint. \\n\\nTrailing from his neck in the profile view is a wobbly striped blue and orange tie. His body is cropped at the chest and shoulders by the frame.\\n\\nThe artist signature, ‘nolan’ above the numbers ‘88’, are painted in small orange letters in the bottom right-hand corner. \\n\\nAudio description written by Alana Sivell and voiced by Molly Desmond",

In the late 1940s he trained at the National Art School; he travelled and studied overseas through the first half of the 1950s. In 1967 he won first prize at the Mildura Sculpture Triennial with a large cast-iron equestrian piece. His subsequent public commissions include the untitled copper and ceramic mosaic fountain at Bruce Hall at the Australian National University; _Spheres_ 1977 (known locally as _Bert’s Balls_) for the Rundle Street Mall, Adelaide; and the _Dobell Memorial_ 1978 for Martin Place, Sydney. Controversially, _Tumbling cubes (Dice) (Untitled)_ 1978/1979, originally made for Cameron Offices in Belconnen ACT, was some years ago moved to a nearby park, according to the artist a 'hopelessly inappropriate site'. _Cones_ 1982 dominates the Sculpture Garden at the National Gallery of Australia, and the _Winged figure (Lawrence Hargrave memorial)_ 1988 towers 6m high at Mt Keira, near Wollongong. Flugelman taught from 1973 to 1983 at the South Australian School of Art, and from 1984 to 1990 at the University of Wollongong, from which he received an honorary doctorate. There was a retrospective exhibition of his five decades' work at the Drill Hall Gallery, Australian National University in 2009.",

Coming to prominence in the early 1960s, her longstanding career spanned ceramics, drawing, printmaking, painting and installation, with her subject matter often exploring existentialism and humanism. In February 1983, Maddock’s home and studio in Victoria’s Mount Macedon were razed in the Ash Wednesday fires, one of the deadliest bushfires in Australian history. She was forced to flee, with decades of work destroyed. Using the technique of photo screenprinting, _Fleeing figure_ imbues a haunting sense of eeriness. Maddock inscribed on the work, ‘The figure in studio overalls shows me feeling the night-time glow of approaching fire.’ She created many self portraits titled _Fleeing figure_ in response to the traumatic event.",

It is 45 cm high, 58 cm wide and 13 cm deep. The sculpture combines two simplified stylised heads in profile gazing at each other, and joined at the shoulders which are facing forward. The left-hand figure has dark brown hair streaming out to the left, with stitching that looks like cornrows. She has large dark eyes with raised eyebrows and full orange lips, closed but upturned in a smile. She wears a checked top with purple vertical stripes, and horizontal stripes of green and red alternating with golden yellow stars.\\n\\nThe right-hand figure has messy dark brown hair, flaring out behind in abstract irregular shapes. Strong black eyebrows and long straight white eyelashes frame simple circular eyes with white centres outlined in black. Her orange lips are closed. She wears a top with a pink, yellow and royal blue floral pattern on the front and a pattern of lime green, red and white flowers on the back.\\n\\nAudio description written and voiced by Krysia Kitch",

Throughout her creative life she specialised in open \\n\\nline drawing, lithography and mixed media techniques on paper. Despite \\n\\nstudying under William Dargie at Swinburne Technical College, and later \\n\\nGeorge Bell, whose methods were grounded in the formal principles of \\n\\ndesign, MacQueen developed a visual language of spontaneous expressive \\n\\nmarks. Her oeuvre is characterised by minimal sweeping lines and \\n\\ngestural, quickly drawn responses to the world around her that often \\n\\ndepict birds, animals and suburban landscapes. Throughout her practice, \\n\\nthe tension between her life as an artist and her domestic role was \\n\\noften a source of frustration. _Disillusion self portrait_\\n\\nsuggestively speaks to this inner turmoil. A charcoal sketch of the \\n\\nartist’s face is collaged over a bright pastel drawing of her upper \\n\\nbody, evoking a sense of separation between the emotional and rational \\n\\nself.",

Strongly interested in modern art, she attended the avant-garde Westminster School, where she completed what are considered some of Australia's first cubist paintings, _Still Life_ and _Painting IX_ (both 1937). With the outbreak of war she returned to Australia, thereafter teaching at Canberra Grammar and then at the Julian Ashton and National Art Schools in Sydney. The first of her thirteen solo exhibitions was held at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries in 1940; over decades, she was close friends with fellow Macquarie artists Grace Cossington Smith and Thea Proctor. She painted many still-life pictures, featuring flowers and fruit arranged on sunlit indoor tables, but from the 1950s onward she also painted abstract works, often inspired by landscapes and influenced by Paul Cézanne. Though her work is now represented in major collections, Appleton was like many women artists of her generation in that recognition came late in life: she was in her eighties when a public gallery first presented a retrospective exhibition of her art.\\n\\nThis is a study for the self portrait with which Appleton won the inaugural Portia Geach Memorial Award in 1965. Her abstract landscapes are evoked in the background to the finished self-portrait, which is more sombre than this sketchy, light-filled, rosy study.",

I like to work very freely and spontaneously in colour. And I feel if one has too much of a preconceived idea, one tends to lose the freshness and get a rather forced and striving feeling about it, as if you were trying to copy something that you already had seen in your mind.\\n\\nI’ve found myself becoming increasingly interested in still life subjects. I feel I like to abstract them a good deal but I’m interested in shapes and objects in space, and their relationship to each other, and I look for the abstract qualities in these things rather than making any effort to reproduce them.\\n\\nI’m interested in order; I don’t like things to be chaotic, and I like to feel that there is an ordered relation between the parts of a painting. Colour, of course, is an absolute joy, and I love warm colours; reds, yellows and warm violets, although I get a great deal of pleasure out of blues, too – I think it’s perhaps unwise to say that you have any favourite colours.\\n\\nI like to work on a fairly large scale and I like to be able to start a painting and go on and work and work at it without being interrupted. I think that’s one of the most difficult things in this modern life we lead, being able to get away from interruptions.\\n\\nBut I do think it’s awfully difficult to say just what your aim is in painting a picture. I feel that the picture says it for you much better than you can say it yourself. And I feel that any good thing in a painting is usually something that you can’t talk about.",

Moving to the Northern Territory in the late 1940s, he worked as a drover and miner, before relocating to Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia. He converted to Baptist Christianity in the mid-1960s, and became a church elder. Shortly after this he began to make shields, boomerangs and coolamons decorated with ochre; he started to paint figuratively on paper, shields and canvas in the early 1980s. Many of his paintings include Christian imagery, and some combine his traditional stories and personal experiences with Baptist stories; his body of work expresses his philosophy that we 'gotta make 'em whole lot one family'. The exhibition _Jarinyanu David Downs, Kurtal as Sel_f, held in the artist's community of Fitzroy Crossing in 2016, was the first show of his works since his death in 1995.\\n\\nThis 1990 self-portrait was among the works in the 2016 exhibition. Karen Dayman's essay in the exhibition catalogue states that in this painting, Jarinyanu has depicted himself painted for a ceremony honouring Kurtal the Rainmaker and celebrating the connection between the rain and the replenishment of the land and of food sources that it creates.",

He used natural earth pigments and synthetic polymer paint on an unframed linen canvas approximately 1.1 m tall and 84 cm wide.\\n\\nThe deep orange-ochre ground the work is painted on shows as a border around the edges of the canvas. Within it, a narrow rectangle, about 2 cm wide, has been painted freehand in black. Along the top edge and part way down the right side are short black lines poking inwards, each ending in a round black mass. They start small in the top left and grow larger.\\n\\nWithin the borders, the background of orange-ochre is covered in small yellow and grey dots.\\n\\nJarinyanu stands in the centre, a simplified black figure with round eyes and a wide mouth. He is decorated with grey and white markings, a band around his forehead, curved mirrored chest markings, a groin covering and stripes upon each upper thigh.\\n\\nHe is positioned straight on, arms raised to a long black beam running horizontally under his chin. It spans almost the entire width of the canvas. The beam is surrounded by finer vertical grey lines tipped with grey dots.\\n\\nFilling the bottom of the portrait around Jarinyanu’s feet is a semi-circle of rows of numerous small black seated figures with round heads and outstretched arms.\\n\\nAudio description written and voiced by Lucinda Shawcross",

Having achieved great success in this field – he won a Cannes Gold Lion in 1967 – he gave it up to paint full-time in 1980, working from a 'cabin' below his home on Sydney Harbour. Soon, his stylised, colourful representations of Sydney's beaches, harbour, animals and flowers found their way onto placemats, t-shirts, swimwear, bedlinen, mugs and vases; in the 1990s, the walls, ceiling and some furniture in the Garden Restaurant at the Powerhouse Museum were covered with murals by the artist. His crucial role in promoting Sydney as a tourist destination, particularly in Japan, is now widely acknowledged. Until this self portrait was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery, no major Australian art museum held an example of his work. His memoir _Ken Done: A life coloured in_ was published in 2016 and his _Ken Done: Paintings you probably haven't seen_ in 2017.",

                    "transcript": "A self portrait of the artist Ken Done created in 1992. Oil and synthetic polymer paint on canvas measures 102 centimetres high and 76 centimetres wide.\\n\\nThe frame is painted a matte black with a floral and leaf design loosely scratched into the surface. The inner border of the frame is a darkened gold.\\n\\nThe background and figure are a patchwork of clashing colours and patterns. The surface is heavily textured, with brush marks evident and some short hairs from the paint brush caught in the paint. Ken Done’s face fills the frame; the top of his head, edges of his ears and base of neck, reach the outer edges of the canvas.\\n\\nA line of thick black paint arcs across the top of his head. His face is divided into shapes, with his forehead painted red with yellow dots on the left side and cobalt blue on the right side, with a stylised white outline of the Sydney Harbour Bridge floating on top. The rest of his face is painted in zones of pink, forest green and blues. A patch of black with yellow stripes features under the left eye. A simplified outline of the Sydney Opera House is painted in white, filled in with blue on the right cheek.\\n\\nHe has painted himself with three non-matching eyes; the left eye, pink and blue with a yellow pupil, the right eye, yellow with a black pupil and a central eye, blue with a yellow pupil outlined in yellow. He has merged a profile face with a full-face representation, reminiscent of a cubist style of painting. Thick yellow paint outlines the yellow eye, eyebrow and side profile of a nose and mouth with a flash of white teeth. This profile sits on top of the right side of the full-face view. The frontal representation is more dominant with the eyes rimmed in black, a black moustache and exaggerated red banana-shaped smile. His neck brings together strong brush strokes of purple, orange, red, black and blue. \\n\\nThe top half of the background is painted a cobalt blue with the word ‘me’ painted in yellow block letters in the top left corner. The lower section of the canvas is coloured orange on the left side of his neck and has sections of mottled tones of turquoise, burgundy and green and a patch of yellow with irregular red dots on the right.  \\nThe artist initials, ‘KD’ are roughly painted in red in the lower right-hand corner. \\n\\nAudio description written by Alana Sivell and voiced by Molly Desmond.",

                    "content": "George Foxhill studied art in his native Austria, attending the Kunstegewerbeschule and the Volkshochschule in Salzburg after the Second World War. He responded to the expressionist legacy of the city and the hardship and rude vigour of the times, and his lifetime’s work evidences affinities with Austrian expressionists such as Oskar Kokoshka whom he met in his youth. With his wife Rosa, Foxhill migrated to Australia in 1956. Two years later, the couple moved into the raw, newly established suburb of Dickson, now an inner-city area of Canberra. Foxhill’s strength of purpose and belief in himself carried him through years of cultural aridity in the Australian Capital Territory, in which he was one of very few serious expressionist painters. Finally, in the 1980s, the power of his portraits describing emotional and psychological states recognition began to be recognised. The National Portrait Gallery held an exhibition of Foxhill’s work, curated by Michael Desmond, in the last year of the artist’s life. Foxhill said ‘A painter paints not because he wants to represent what he sees and is competent to do so, but because the visible world stimulates him to satisfy his deep urge to shape his understanding of life and nature.’",

                    "content": "Mirka Mora (1928–2018), French-born artist and restaurateur, was loved as much for her contributions to contemporary art as for her generous and outrageous nature. Having narrowly escaped Auschwitz as a girl, Mora trained in drama in Paris. By 1951, when she came to Melbourne with her husband, Georges, she was committed to painting. Soon the couple became friends with the city's leading artists and collectors, and were instrumental in the re-formation of the Contemporary Art Society. Over the 1950s and 1960s they opened the European-style Mirka Café in Exhibition Street, Balzac in East Melbourne and the Tolarno in St Kilda. While Georges established himself as an art dealer, opening Tolarno Galleries in 1967, Mirka became a bohemian icon of the city. She worked prolifically for six decades across a range of media and is represented in many state and regional collections.\\n\\nPainted in 2000, when she was in her early seventies, this self-portrait depicts Mora with the youthful looks for which she was known so well. Despite this, there is a sense of age and quiet to the portrait; the palette of subdued earth tones, and the treatment of the eyes particularly, give the sense that Mora approached this work from a point of introspection. Created in the year she left her beloved little cottage in St Kilda and moved into a new flat her son William built for her at his gallery in Richmond, this work may acknowledge unsurprising feelings of sadness, time passing and the end of an era.",

Actually my drawings are like living dreams. Sometimes they appear very incoherent but I know that all this incoherence, if I search in it the truth is there. Each drawing has a very strong meaning. It as if my unconscious – or subconscious – would want to become conscious. Each drawing is a riddle which I have to decipher, and this is why I can never, I will never stop drawing because the answers of the riddles always come, sooner or later.\\n\\nWhen I was expecting my third child I was drawing my little people all the time. Sometimes I’d draw little animals too, but they have human legs or they have human arms. This goes back far away in the history of art, of course, I’m aware of that, but it’s a truth and it travels all through time and it comes and visits some artists from time to time. Must be that little beast we’ve got inside us, that’s what it is. Anyhow, when I was expecting my third child, all my little drawings had four toes, and everybody used to say, ‘Why do you do four toes? You know a foot has five toes’, and I said, ‘Well, my people have four toes, you know, I can’t help it, my hand does it. I’m not thinking about it. It just has to have four toes because when I feel the foot it just comes out with four toes’. And when my baby came out, he was born, it had one foot with four toes.\\n\\nSo you can see what faith I have in my work. The truth is inside you always and you have to find it.",

When England declared war with Germany in September 1939, he was interned as an enemy alien and banished to Australia on the troopship Dunera. On the voyage and subsequently in the prison camp at Hay, New South Wales, he was mentored by sculptor Heinz Henghes, surrealist painter and designer Hein Heckroth, photographer Helmut Gernsheim, and Bauhaus lecturer Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack. From them, Friedeberger learned art history and colour theory, and produced studies, portraits and surrealist-inspired compositions. Released from the camp in 1942, he joined the Australian military forces and was based briefly in Melbourne. Painting in his free time, he became acquainted with Australian artists Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan and William Dobell. While many of his works reflect his wartime experiences, this self portrait highlights Friedeberger’s early practice where he became increasingly interested in colour, playing with a rich, vibrant palette and a figurative approach to painting.",

In 1968, while \\n\\nstudying at the National Art School, he became the youngest artist ever \\n\\nto win the Sulman Prize (he was 19); he won again in 1984. Layering \\n\\ncolour to build rich tone and hue, Storrier’s paintings often feature \\n\\nmotifs of fire or floating, surreal elements, and capture his personal \\n\\nreflections of the beauty and harshness of the outback. In his self \\n\\nportraits, such as his 2012 Archibald Prize-winning The Histrionic Wayfarer (after Bosch),\\n\\nfigures are often represented through faceless, full-body depictions \\n\\ncomprised of brightly coloured personal objects that relate directly to \\n\\nthe subject’s identity. In this self portrait, however, Storrier has \\n\\npainted his profile in a dark, stormy colour palette, with only his \\n\\nglasses as an identifiable feature. It is shadowy and allusive, speaking\\n\\nto the artist’s psychological self.",

Born in Vienna, Cassab studied art in Prague and at the Budapest Academy before adopting false papers and 'going underground' to escape the persecution of Hungarian Jews. After the war, she and her husband reunited and emigrated to Sydney in 1951. Within months of arriving, she was commissioned by Sir Charles Lloyd Jones to paint a portrait of his wife, becoming an Archibald finalist for the first time the following year. By the mid-1960s she was sought-after as a portraitist. She won the Archibald Prize twice, for her portrait of her friend, Stanislaus Rapotec, in 1960, and with her painting of artist Margo Lewers in 1967. Through her many other portraits she created a distinct record of Australian society from the 1950s onwards. Cassab also found inspiration for a more abstract style of painting in the landscape of the Northern Territory, to which she repeatedly returned, and won several awards for her landscape works in the Wynne Prize. \\n\\nCassab painted this self-portrait at the age of 86 in 2006. It captures her spirit of resilience and determination, having survived the Holocaust and built a successful career as a portrait artist in Australia.",

Then, as I developed in my other paintings, the portrait developed with it. I still think that every portrait I do is a failure because it didn’t reach what I wanted to do with it. I think I’m best known as a portrait painter because these are the things that get most publicity, but I never wanted to be a portrait painter and I don’t consider myself one.\\n\\nLately, I tried to combine abstract with the portrait but I don’t think it’s a good marriage. I think the best I can do is to paint my abstract pictures and develop them and develop myself, and let the portraits flow freely, because I don’t believe that something which was art all through the centuries stops being art just because it lost its credit by the photographic portraits, the anonymous portraits, from which we have 300 in each country in the world; and although I know that it is a clash, I think, between my other paintings and the portraits, I can’t give up. It’s something that interests me, and that I might solve or might not. Anyway, it doesn’t matter if I solve it when I’m 70.",

Although he is known for his landscapes and mythical subjects, and produced relatively few portraits, Boyd made a number of paintings of family and friends, all redolent of his interest in deep human truths. This intense and searching self-portrait was painted at a time when the artist was reading the novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, and engaged on a series of works on the agony of war. Although he represented himself as apprehensive and isolated, Albert Tucker took a photo of Boyd with the recently completed work, surrounded by friends in his studio at his family’s home, which captures the sense of the shared creative environment in which this and other portraits of the 1940s were painted.",

But, I mean, you don’t ever come out with anything fresh or marvellous, it always seems ghastly when it goes up on the wall, and maybe it is.\\n\\nI hope it’s becoming less taped, or typed. Not meant to be a pun, but anyway, I think that’s what I’d prefer to be happening, that it’s becoming just as much mine, if I can make it that way, but much less typed in the sense that it would be, well, ‘that’s Australian’, or ‘that comes from Melbourne, that comes from Ballarat, that’s where …’. I’d like it to be much more a universal sort of thing. I don’t mean necessarily the painting to look as if it could be done anywhere, but just that it would be much more like good painting rather than like something that comes from somewhere.",

Dora married Leslie Nichol Walford, the youngest son of colonial Sydney businessman, William Barnard Walford, in 1917. Their only child, Leslie Nichol Walford junior, who was to achieve renown as an interior decorator, was born in 1927. Following her husband’s death in 1929, Dora became increasingly involved in charity and fundraising work. In 1936, as Dora Sheller (and a widow for the second time), she helped establish the Black & White Committee of the Royal Blind Society of NSW, and served as the Committee’s first president. In 1938, Dora left Sydney for England accompanied by Leslie and her third husband, Ben Knowles-Davies (who died in the course of the journey). In England during the war, Dora worked as a salvage officer for Winchester County Council. She married again in 1944; her fourth husband, Lawrence Byrne, was then serving with the British army. They remained in London until 1951, when they returned to Australia and settled at Burradoo in the Southern Highlands. Dora Byrne died in Sydney in 1972.\\n\\nRichard von Marientreu (1902–1991) was born in Poland and attended military academies in Cracow and Vienna before leaving for Prague, where he studied at the Academy of Painting. In London from 1933, von Marientreu was introduced into fashionable society by his patron, Mrs Marie Ludlow- Symonds. He was soon in demand as a portrait painter, many of his subjects coming from high-ranking sections of the military and society, including royalty. Between 1935 and 1955, he created portraits of sitters such as King George V; Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother; and Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery. He also exhibited regularly throughout this period, often with large scale genre paintings dealing with subjects such as mythology, war and historical scenes. His obituary in The Times recalled him as ‘a very gentle man, and immaculately turned out, choosing always to paint, no matter what the subject, in one of the same Savile Row tailored suits that he might wear to one of his exhibition openings’.",

Born in Shanghai, he became an artist at age 20, producing patriotic images while working as a farmer with the People's Liberation Army in the early 1970s. Self-taught at first, he later studied at Beijing’s Central Academy of Fine Arts and became a specialist in history paintings, many of which he produced for public collections. After arriving in Sydney, he supported himself by making sketches of passers-by at Darling Harbour. He was selected as an Archibald Prize finalist for the first time in 1993 and has been a sought-after portraitist ever since, creating works for clients such as Parliament House and participating in numerous solo and group exhibitions. ‘When I came here I was nothing … so any commission was very exciting. But for a long time now, I’ve been interested in making paintings that show the big things’, he says. \\n\\nHe commenced work on this portrait of Tasmanian-born Queen Mary of Denmark (b. 1972) in Sydney in February 2005, when the then Crown Princess made her first royal tour of her homeland. The sitting took place in a Circular Quay hotel suite boasting an excellent view of the Sydney Opera House, which, being the work of Danish architect Jørn Utzon, Shen included as a symbol of his subject’s dual Australian and Danish identity. The column to her left is based on the architecture of Copenhagen’s Amalienborg Palace, and she wears a blue sash with the insignia of the Knight of the Order of the Elephant, Denmark’s highest honour. Given the limited time available for the sitting, Shen took many photographs of the Princess and made several studies and sketches, which were acquired along with the finished painting in September 2005.",

The ivory shaft of the column disappears up and out past the portraits top edge.\\n\\nDirectly behind Mary is the corner of a room whose walls are a mixture of peach, muted yellow and hints of green. On our right is a sweeping view of the Sydney Opera House.\\n\\nThe bay and the Opera House are elegantly obscured by gossamer curtain floating ever so lightly back into the interior where Mary is standing.\\n\\nOn the floor large square tiles in gold, peach and green issues are separated by darker grout. They dissolve on a diagonal out to the right, into the view of the sea and the Opera House, as if Mary is standing on a balcony high above the water.\\n\\nMary is angled towards us, facing the window, her right cheek is turned as though we have just said something engaging her attention.\\n\\nHer dark brown shoulder length hair is combed off her face, swept behind her ears with the weight of the soft girls resting on her right shoulder.\\n\\nShe has hazel eyes and sculpted brows. Her right eyebrow raised slightly higher than the left. She has a porcelain complexion and pink lips. All of her features accentuated by artfully applied makeup.\\n\\nHer mouth is open in the hint of a smile, straight white teeth only just visible. From her ears hang diamonds and blue sapphires, each comprising five equally sized clusters of teardrops. Her earrings perfectly match the blue of her dress.\\n\\nThe \"V\" shape neckline of her sea blue sleeveless dress follows the gentle curve of her breasts. A length of ruched dark fabric twines around her slight torso, and the light blue of her bodice. At the hips another wrap of the same fabric meets the bottom splayed edges of a thin formal sash that falls from her left shoulder down her right hip, were a tiny white elephant is suspended.\\n\\nShe clasps her hands loosely in front, elbow slightly bent, though her left arm is out of view. A ring with a large sea blue sapphire rests on the ring finger of her right hand. The pleated folds of her full length skirt fall in swathes from her hips to the floor obscuring her feet. The skirt's light fabric catches the same slight breeze passing through the curtain from outside.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Emma Bedford and voiced by Carol Wellman Kelly**",

By the time of the birth of their sons, William junior and John (1804–1877), Fairfax senior was involved in the furniture trade. Widowed in 1835, she emigrated to New South Wales with John, his wife Sarah (née Reading, 1808–1875), and their three children in 1838. Three years later, John Fairfax, in partnership with journalist Charles Kemp, purchased the Sydney Herald, which became the Sydney Morning Herald in 1842. By the mid-1850s, John Fairfax, with his sons Charles John Fairfax (1829–1864) and James Reading Fairfax (1834 –1919), owned the Herald outright, building a highly successful publishing enterprise and a family association with the paper that would last almost 150 years. Elizabeth was remembered by her grandson James as ‘a woman of strong religious convictions’ who greatly influenced her son’s contributions to the Congregational Church in the colony. ‘It was her teaching and inheriting her strong character that led to [John Fairfax’s] success in life and in placing her sons and grandsons where they are’, he said. Elizabeth died in Sydney, aged 83, in 1861.",

One of the first undergraduates to study at the University of Sydney, he developed a particular interest in education and the rights of women – he was responsible for the Married Women's Property Act of 1879, and was Founding Chairman of the university’s Women’s College. As a young man he worked as a reporter on Henry Parkes’s radical liberal newspaper Empire. Windeyer represented West Sydney in the Legislative Assembly intermittently from 1860; in 1876 and 1878–1879 he was attorney general in the Parkes–Robertson coalition. This portrait is one of a trio that Tom Roberts dubbed ‘Church, State and the Law’ – the others were a portrait of Parkes, and one of Cardinal Moran. Parkes wrote in Fifty Years in the Making of Australian History (1892) that ‘My friend Windeyer was a young man of high spirit, bold and decisive in the common incidents of life, with a strong capacity for public affairs. He would have made as good a soldier as he has made a sound Judge.’",

All that he may hope for is, after years of toil laboriously spent in trying to do his duty, that he may win the confidence of the intelligent thinking portion of the community, those who are interested in maintaining law and order, those who desire to see the rights of property respected, and every citizen protected, as far as the right administration of justice can protect him, in the enjoyment of his personal liberty, in his character and in the exercise of his rights. And when the public has thoroughly come to understand that his only desire is to see the right succeed and the truth established, juries may feel confident that they may safely accept such advice and assistance in their deliberations as it comes within the province of a judge to offer. Of popularity beyond this he can know nothing\\n\\nThe duties he has to discharge are often disagreeable, and sometimes painful. Indeed, one of the drawbacks attending the judicial position was that it very much cut one off from social intercourse with one’s fellow citizens in a small society like this, where everyone was known, and where so many who might be known as acquaintances, were frequently before the Court, as parties to proceedings before it. So, one must be careful to avoid all appearance of evil occasion for scandal.",

Mundy thereby gained access to an aspirational, socially-mobile clientele who sought portraits as a form of image management. Susan Lord (c. 1792–1849) was the wife of former soldier Thomas Daunt Lord, who came to Van Diemens Land as a free settler in 1825. From then until 1832, Thomas was commandant of the convict station on Maria Island. Later, having been suspended from duty as a magistrate on suspicion of misappropriating government property, he farmed at Triabunna. Mundy married Thomas and Susan Lord’s eldest daughter, Lavinia, his former student, in 1834. This portrait of Susan forms half of the pair of paintings Mundy did of his parents-in-law. Elements such as the drapery in the background and Susan’s jewellery, bonnet, ringlets and lace collar help to project material comfort and respectability.\\n\\nDespite his ‘excellent taste and professional ability’, Mundy’s practice gradually declined and exacerbated his alcoholism and depression. He took an overdose of laudanum in a Hobart pub in March 1848, leaving Lavinia and five children to ‘lament his untimely demise’.",

Aged sixteen, she was cast in the lead role of the film _Jedda_, but the experience was largely negative, and at twenty she joined the Community of the Holy Name, an Anglican order of nuns in Melbourne. With the order's blessing, she left in 1967 to undertake community work with Aboriginal people. She was involved in various initiatives with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs before returning to the Northern Territory where she was active in politics, social work and environmental causes. In 1979, she sought election to the Legislative Assembly to fight the proposed construction of a dam which threatened sacred land. Having moved back to Utopia in 2008, she became a prominent spokesperson for First Nations peoples and human rights, addressing the UN's Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 2010 and speaking out on issues including the Northern Territory Intervention and Aboriginal deaths in custody. She was the Northern Territory Australian of the Year and the NAIDOC Person of the Year for 2015.\\n\\nThis portrait by Melbourne-born painter and engraver Donald Cameron shows Kunoth in 1967, painted after the Cameron family returned from living in the United Kingdom.",

In 1935 Drysdale married Elizabeth 'Bon' Stephens and two years later, Purves Smith left for Europe, followed in 1938 by Maisie and her mother. After Maisie returned home Purves Smith cabled his proposal to her but they were separated for the duration of the war. They married in 1946 in Melbourne, with Drysdale as best man; however, Purves Smith died following surgery to relieve symptoms of tuberculosis in 1949. Three years later, Maisie completed library studies and became a librarian at the City of Coburg Library and later, the Camberwell City Library. She also served on the Editorial Committee of the Children's Book Council of Victoria. In November 1963, Bon Drysdale died, and seven months later Maisie married Russell Drysdale. They bought a block of land near Gosford, Bouddi Farm, where they lived for the rest of their lives, travelling widely; Maisie outlived Russell by twenty years.\\n\\nThis modernist portrait of Maisie by her husband-to-be Peter Purves Smith is thought to have been painted while they were both in London, before he joined the British Army in 1940. The restricted colour palette focuses attention on Maisie's elegant profile, framed by her fur collar.",

After moving to Double Bay in the 1930s, Proctor made a slender living from exhibitions, commissioned drawings and from teaching. The subject of this work, Diana Pockley (1913–2011), was one of the influential, cultivated women who came to Proctor's apartment for art lessons and conversation. English-born Pockley was an outstanding needleworker who helped establish the NSW Embroiderers Guild. Also a keen gardener, she founded the National Trust of Australia (NSW) Garden Committee in 1964 to raise funds for gardens in the Trust's care, and she was involved with Trust's Women's Committee in fundraising for the restoration of a number of historic properties. Pockley and Proctor lived close to each other, and would often paint together in Pockley's garden.",

From 1824 to 1828 he commanded another expedition to the Arctic which resulted in a knighthood. After 30 years of naval service, he accepted an appointment as lieutenant-governor of Tasmania, arriving in Hobart in 1837. Franklin, his wife Jane and his private secretary Alexander Maconochie brought progressive ideas about the cultural development of the colony and the reformation of the penal system, but powerful colonists, who profited from convict labour, harried him until he was recalled in 1843. Franklin disappeared on his final expedition to the Arctic in 1845. Jane Franklin sponsored four expeditions to find him before it was eventually established that he and all of his crew had perished.",

He exhibited his portraits in his Edinburgh barber shop until 1785, when he started working as an artist full-time. Thereafter, he depicted ‘every figure of note in Edinburgh’, and it’s said that some of his best customers were subjects who were offended by his images and who bought his prints for the sole purpose of destroying them. The courts and the scaffold were other sources of Kay’s subject matter. This work depicts mariner Thomas Whyte (1793–1826), who was sentenced to 14 years’ transportation to New South Wales in 1814 for the crime of culpable homicide. \\n\\nKay’s prints were published in two volumes in 1837 and 1838, with further editions appearing in 1842 and 1877. His caricatures now enrich the holdings of many public collections, including the National Portrait Galleries in London and Edinburgh.",

During World War I, Kingsford Smith had served on the ground in Gallipoli, Egypt and France before transferring to the Australian Flying Corps and later the Royal Flying Corps, as a member of which he was awarded the Military Cross. He worked in England, America and Australia as a stunt flyer and joy- flight pilot before forming his own aviation company in 1924. Charles Ulm, who at the age of sixteen had been amongst the first troops to land at Gallipoli, and who had later served on the Western Front, had returned to Sydney with a vision of establishing successful commercial airlines. He became Kingsford Smith’s business partner in 1927. That year they circumnavigated Australia in less than half the previous record time. In 1928, he and Kingsford Smith co-piloted the plane later known as Southern Cross across the Pacific from California to Brisbane. Later that year the pair made the first trans-Tasman flight from Sydney to Christchurch. Ulm made several more record-breaking flights, both with Kingsford Smith in Southern Cross, and in command of his own aircraft Faith in Australia. In 1934, Ulm went down in the sea between California and Hawaii in his Airspeed Envoy Stella Australis. His body was never found. Kingsford Smith had become world-famous by 1930, and in 1932 he was knighted for services to aviation, but in business he was almost back to where he started, selling joyflights at ten shillings a ride and establishing an ill-fated flying school. Nonetheless, his marvellous achievements continued until he, too, disappeared, probably near the coast of Burma, on an attempt at the Britain-Australia record.\\n\\nOne of seventeen portraits by Sir William Dargie acquired by 2013, the painting of the aviation heroes is also one of a mere handful of posthumous portraits in the Collection. In 2001 the Sydney Airports Corporation made a gift of the painting to the National Portrait Gallery along with two busts of Kingsford Smith and Ulm by Enid Fleming.",

Broad brushstrokes of light blue and pink give way to a greener bluish tint in the lower section of the background. The clouds descend into pale grey as the landscape blurs into the distance.\\n\\nBathed in sunlight, the men stand close together and are cropped at the hip. Captain Charles Ulm on our left, faces forward, half his body obscured by Sir Charles Kingsford Smith who stands in front, his body turned toward Ulm, side on.\\n\\nUlm’s direct gaze is forward to us. He has wavy brown hair cut shorter around his prominent ears and a warm rosy tanned complexion. The light from his right creates shadows on the left side of his clear broad forehead and delineates his straight nose, plump cheeks and double chin. His arched dark eyebrows, narrowed laughing eyes and parted lips open his cheery face into a wide smile. \\n\\nUlm wears a beige and green scarf wrapped around his neck and tucked into his aviator jump suit, unzipped to form a V. The one-piece suit is uniformly steely blue grey, a large pocket with a silver button and open upper flap is visible on his right chest. The baggy suit puckers at his waist and upper arm, which is bent at the elbow, and allows his right hand to rest on his hip. Cropped at the bottom edge of the painting, a brown strap is visible looped around the top of his index finger. Although Ulm's left arm is unseen, wrapped behind the figure of Kingsford Smith, the fingers and the thumb of that hand rest on Kingsford Smith's left shoulder.\\n\\nSir Charles Kingsford Smith looks out to the right of the portrait with a similarly tanned complexion to Ulm. His brown leather aviator helmet sits tight on his skull over his ears and clips together under his chin. His round glass goggles are raised above his eyes and held tight against his forehead. With his long oval face in three-quarter profile, a shadow plays on the left side of his face, accentuating his straight eyebrows, drooped eyelids and blue eyes. He has pronounced cheek bones and a long slightly hooked nose. He too is smiling with closed lips, with a slight curved crease around both corners of his mouth. Kingsford Smith wears a chocolate brown leather flying jacket, one side flaps open across his chest and is lined in a beige green sheepskin. At his waist his hands clasp a long slim white folded paper.\\n\\n**Audio description written and voiced by Annette Twyman, 2021**",

He completed his initial training at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas in 1993 and undertook training for long-duration space missions in Russia. He made his first space flight in 1996 and in 1998 boarded the _Endeavour_ space shuttle to work at the Mir space station. As part of the 2001 _Discovery_ mission, he completed a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk to install components to the International Space Station. In 2005 he flew on the STS114 _Discovery_ mission, undertaking new methods to inspect the orbiter in flight and to verify its fitness for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. He retired from NASA in 2014 having logged more than 177 days in space.\\n\\nCommissioned to create this work, Canadian-born photographers Denis Montalbetti and Gay Campbell conceived of a heroic portrait evoking the sense of courage and discovery associated with images of the early days of space exploration. Photographing Thomas in his NASA spacesuit was central to the concept, but the suits are so valuable they are not allowed to leave NASA facilities. So the artists went to Houston for the shoot. They had the backdrop – representing Earth as seen from space – fabricated beforehand, so that they could create the image they'd planned.",

Born in the Northern Territory and raised in Brisbane, she was only fifteen when she won two silver medals at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. When she announced her retirement from international swimming in 2012, she had won a total of nine Olympic medals, fourteen World Championship medals and twelve Commonwealth Games medals. In her 2015 memoir _Body Lengths_, she candidly discussed her history of anxiety, depression and her experience of the bullying and humiliation often endured by female swimmers around issues of weight and body image. Consequently, Jones has been an ambassador for Beyond Blue and was one of the faces of Swimming Queensland's 'Growing up in Lycra' campaign. Jones was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2015.\\n\\nThis portrait of Jones is one of four images photographed by Peter Brew-Bevan for a feature story in _Good Weekend_ magazine. Published on 26 September 2015, this image featured on the cover. As Brew-Bevan noted on his Facebook page: 'It was an absolute pleasure creating this cover – despite the commotion of Huskies chasing down little ducklings in the pool and it being a rather chilly 13 degrees! And no the pool was not heated!'",

She was ranked first in the world in her signature event, the 400m, in which she won back-to-back World Championships in 1997 and 1999 and the Olympic gold medal in 2000. She was the first person to be named both Young Australian of the Year (1990) and Australian of the Year (1998). Freeman retired from running in July 2003, still enjoying the immense popularity she earned during her exceptional career. The Catherine Freeman Foundation, established in 2007, has since enhanced opportunities for individuals living in disadvantaged Australian communities. \\n\\nDavid Caird, a press photographer, was assigned to cover Freeman's unforgettable Sydney Olympic race, which was at 8pm.

Switching to road racing, he moved to England in the hope of becoming a Formula 1 driver. Racing in a Cooper Climax, Brabham won the World Championship in 1959 in sensational style. In the last lap of the deciding race he was leading the field when his fuel ran out. Undaunted, he pushed the vehicle over the finish line to take the Championship. It was his first of three. In 1966 he became the first driver in Formula 1 history to win the title in a car of his own design, the Repco Brabham. As a driver, Brabham has been described as ‘untidy, but very effective’. Indeed, he won a career total of 14 Grand Prix events before retiring in 1970. Australian of the Year in 1966, in 1979 he became the first person to be knighted for services to motor sport.\\n\\nSculptor Julie Edgar, a motor sports enthusiast, also made the bronze bust of Peter Brock in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery.

Before turning to road racing in 2001, he’d represented Australia at the Atlanta and Sydney Olympics and won the mountain bike world cups of 1998 and 1999. A climber and time trial specialist known for his outstanding endurance and mental toughness, Evans finished inside the top ten in his first two Tour de France appearances. On his third, he became the first Australian to achieve a place on the podium, finishing second, and he was runner-up again in 2008. A week after finishing third in the 2009 Vuelta a España he became the men’s road racing world champion, following this up with wins in the Belgian road race La Flèche Wallone in 2010, and the Tirreno–Adriatico (in 2011). A favourite for the 2011 Tour de France, Evans secured the yellow jersey in the penultimate stage and on 24 July 2011 became the first Australian to win the epic race. He featured in its top ten again in 2012 and finished third in the gruelling 2013 edition of the Giro d’Italia. A veteran of eight world championship road campaigns and member of the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Teams, Evans was Australian Male Road Cyclist of the Year six years running from 2006, and Australian Cyclist of the Year for 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2011. In late 2014, he unveiled plans for the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race, announcing on the same occasion that the inaugural instalment of the event in 2015 would be his last as a professional cyclist. \\n\\nMatthÿs Gerber (b. 1956) was born in the Netherlands and has lived in Australia since 1972.

                    "transcript": "My first Tour de France was in 2005, I started quite late at the age of about 28. Everyone told me you can’t believe how fast it is and how many people there are and not only is it the most competitive with the deepest quality field, the most competitive field to race in, therefore the hardest to win at, it also goes far beyond the sport in terms of the public, the spectators, the number of spectators, but also the type of spectators. You’re still in a bike race and you’re racing along roads but all of a sudden you’re racing in a crowd of maybe a soccer stadium. And yeah, that’s sort of one race where you’ll probably get beers spilt on you once while you’re racing a bike. There might be 100, 200, 300 thousand people standing on the side of the road, and they all want to see one rider and if you’re in the yellow jersey that’s really quite unlike anything else I’ve experienced in life. I wouldn’t say it’s healthy, three weeks is a long time to be in the limelight like that.\\n\\nObviously my 2011 Tour de France victory is what sort of shaped me as a bike rider and, I suppose, as an Australian sports person. I’m proud of how I got there and how I worked and the difficulties that I overcame to get there. Two years previously I became world champion on the road, I won the 2009 World Championship road cycling world championships and that was in a moment of difficulty. A lot of people in the world of cycling didn’t believe in me. But I believed in myself, and I had a few key people around me believe in me and together we overcame what seemed like very difficult odds to do something that was at that moment in my sport in some ways historic.\\n\\nMy biggest thing that motivated me through my career was that one day, my opportunity’s going to end and when that day comes I don’t want to have any regrets that I didn’t’ work hard enough, that I didn’t try hard enough, didn’t make enough sacrifices or I wasn’t dedicated enough. And when that day did come, I crossed the finish line of my last race and I left the world of competitive cycling at the top level in complete peace, with some pride and a great deal of satisfaction of what I had the opportunity to achieve and with those opportunities, what I achieved.",

                    "content": "Trukanini (c. 1812–1876) is arguably nineteenth century Australia’s most celebrated Indigenous leader. A Nuennone woman and the daughter of Mangana, chief of the Recherche Bay people, Trukanini experienced the loss of her mother, sister and intended husband – all as a result of white violence – at a young age. Believing that she might be able to assist in protecting her people, in 1829 Trukanini joined the group of Palawa leaders associated with George Augustus Robinson, an evangelically-inclined free settler who'd been appointed to effect the removal of Tasmania's Aboriginal people to a mission station, Wybalenna, on Flinders Island in Bass Strait. Trukanini remained one of Robinson's most important companions throughout the course of his so-called 'Friendly Mission', the name given to a series of journeys conducted by Robinson between 1830 and 1835. Trukanini went to Wybalenna in 1835, but held to her traditional ways despite the expectation that the Aboriginal people there would adopt European customs and religion. She travelled with Robinson in 1839 to the Port Phillip district, where she later engaged with four others in raids against white settlers. She returned to Flinders Island in 1842; when Wybalenna closed in 1847, Trukanini was among the remaining residents relocated to Oyster Cove, a former convict depot south of Hobart and close to her traditional country. Trukanini died in Hobart in May 1876. As she had feared, her skeleton was stolen from her grave and later displayed at the Tasmanian Museum. The Tasmanian Aboriginal community eventually won the fight to have her wishes honoured: her bones were cremated on the 30th of April 1976 and the following day her ashes were scattered with due ceremony on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Trukanini was erroneously referred to during her lifetime and beyond as the ‘last Tasmanian’ – a false notion attested to by the many descendants of her contemporaries still living in Tasmania today.\\n\\nSheffield-born sculptor Benjamin Law (1807–1890) arrived in Hobart as an assisted immigrant in February 1835. He became acquainted with George Augustus Robinson soon afterwards and through him met Wurati, Trukanini's partner. Despite being advised that ‘the Colony [was] too young’ for him to make a living as a sculptor, Law recognised that there was demand for likenesses of Aboriginal people: a demand driven in part by the colonists’ belief that Tasmania’s Aboriginal people were destined to disappear. Law’s bust of Wurati – considered the first portrait sculpture created in Australia – was completed within two months of Law arriving in Hobart. Copies of the bust were available at four pounds four shillings each and, according to Law’s first wife, Hannah, were ‘called for not only in all Quarters of the Colony, but are being sent to India, to Sweden, to England, Scotland … and Cambridge College’. In 1836, Law commenced his portrait of Trukanini and by October that year announced that he had ‘several duplicates ready for delivery, either in bronze or stone colour’. The portraits of Trukanini and Wurati were valued for their ‘correctness’ and sold well, but Law’s output as a sculptor (which included a bust of Robinson) did not earn him a sufficient living. With Hannah, he worked as the head of Hobart’s Infant School and at Port Arthur before opening a store in Hobart in 1840 that, along with his subsequent business enterprises, proved somewhat unsuccessful. During the 1840s, Law acquired property at Westbury in northern Tasmania. He died at Westbury in October 1890, survived by his fourth wife.",

The three dimensional, cast plaster bust is slightly smaller than lifesize. Approx 60 cm high, 40 cm wide and 25 cm deep, Trucaninny’s bust depicts her head and torso and ends, cropped at her upper arm. The bust is painted jet black, which has a low sheen and is mounted on a cast plaster stand, or socle, which is also black. The simple squat cylindrical stand has a curvaceous form – rounded collar, narrower stem and wider base. \\n\\nHer hair is short with tight curls. Her head is tilted slightly downwards. Her solemn face is broad with strong features. She has a short forehead, strong brow and deep-set eyes. Her gaze is intense. Her prominent cheekbones, either side of her broad nose, give her cheeks a rounded appearance in contrast to the deep-set eyes. She has a full mouth, with an emphasis on the cleft running between her nose and upper lip. She holds her mouth closed, and this, together with her fixed gaze, gives Trucaninny a quiet fortitude. Her square chin is asymmetrical, with an indent slightly left-of-centre. \\n\\nAround her neck, Trucaninny wears a necklace of tiny conical maireener shells laced together. The necklace lies flat against her skin with the narrow ends of the shells pointing outwards. The long strand is wound around her neck twice, resting on her collarbone and lower in the centre of her chest. \\n\\nTrucaninny’s shoulders are rolled forwards slightly, matching the downward tilt of her head and the direction of her gaze. From her right shoulder, draped low across her chest and under her left arm she wears an animal skin. The skin, irregular in shape, is twisted around itself, gaping to reveal her right breast and nipple. The drapes and folds show both sides of the animal skin – the thick furred texture in contrast with the smooth underside. A triangle of fur hangs long over her right breast and past the end of the bust.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Emily Casey and voiced by Carol Wellman Kelly**",

In 1829 Wurati decided to join the party associated with George Augustus Robinson (1788–1866), a free settler and lay preacher appointed to the position of ‘Conciliator of Aborigines’ so as to effect the removal of Tasmania’s Indigenous people to Flinders Island in Bass Strait. This strategy had been conceived by the colonial government, amidst escalating hostilities, for the supposed protection of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities alike. Accompanied by a group of Aboriginal leaders who acted as his guides and interpreters, Robinson conducted a series of expeditions – collectively known as the Friendly Mission – between 1830 and 1835, during which the surviving tribes were persuaded into exile. Wurati and his second wife, Trukanini, became Robinson’s trusted assistants, yet remained fiercely proud of their traditions and identity. Wurati refused to adopt European diet or dress and maintained traditional practices, such as the use of ochre and grease for his hair and beard, even while at Wybalenna – the mission station on Flinders Island to which over one hundred Tasmanian Aboriginal people were eventually exiled. Many died there while waiting for the fulfilment of the promise that they would be allowed to return to their country. In 1839, Wurati was one of the fourteen Tasmanians who went to Port Phillip following Robinson’s appointment to the position of Chief Protector of Aborigines in the new colony. He died on his return journey to Wybalenna in July 1842. \\n\\nWurati sat for this portrait in Hobart in 1835 having been introduced by Robinson to sculptor Benjamin Law. Robinson recalled that: ‘Woureddy sat for his portrait with great patience and was highly pleased with the model.’ Copies of the bust were available at four pounds four shillings each and, according to Law’s wife, Hannah, were ‘called for not only in all Quarters of the Colony, but are being sent to India, to Sweden, to England, Scotland … and Cambridge College’. This work and the bust of Trukanini, completed by Law in Hobart in 1836, are the earliest known portrait sculptures of Australian subjects.",

                    "content": "Sir Ian Potter (1902– 1994), company director, stockbroker, merchant banker and philanthropist, was the founder of the Ian Potter Foundation, one of Australia’s major philanthropic bodies. An enigmatic self-made man, Potter worked full- time while studying economics full-time at Sydney University; he graduated top of his year. In 1936 he moved to Melbourne to found the stockbroking firm Ian Potter & Co. Over his career he served on the boards of twenty-five companies, travelling often to the US and Europe. He retired from Potter and Co in 1967, three years after creating the Ian Potter Foundation. During his lifetime alone, its grants amounted to more than $22 million, and he himself made large donations to the arts, hospitals, universities, sciences, social welfare and environment and heritage conservation until he died. Knighted in 1962, Potter was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Science in 1978 for his ‘conspicuous service to the cause of science’.\\n\\n\\n\\nBryan Westwood (1930–2000), painter and printmaker, was largely self-taught, although he took some classes with Justin O’Brien, Jeffrey Smart and Dorothy Thornhill in the 1960s. Westwood first exhibited paintings of streets and buildings of a vaguely surrealist nature at the Bonython Galleries in 1969. He later turned to photorealist portraits, many of them depicting his artist friends. One such, of artist and critic Elwyn Lynn, won him the Archibald Prize of 1989; he won the prize again in 1992 with an unnerving portrayal of Prime Minister Paul Keating. Between 1972 and 1992 he held solo exhibitions annually. The National Portrait Gallery has portraits by Westwood of Vincent, Warwick and James Fairfax, Bart Cummings, Justin O’Brien, Sir Ian McLennan, Tim Storrier and Malcolm Fraser. This painting, considered by Lady Potter to be the most convincing portrayal of her late husband, was part of the seminal exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery in 1992–93.",

He had joined the expedition in Huahine in the Tahitian archipelago because he sought British arms to avenge the Bora Boran takeover of his father’s land in Ra‘iatea. Cook had assented to his joining, reluctantly, because Mai promised insider knowledge and comraderie for the rest of the Pacific tour. Cook also knew that the naturalist Joseph Banks, back home, yearned to examine a Pacific Islander ‘specimen.’ Banks assumed responsibility for Mai’s stay as soon as the Islander disembarked in London. Banks introduced him to King George III and accompanied him on trips to various English towns. Banks’s fascination dulled after some months, however, and he had set Mai up in a house of his own by early 1775. \\n\\nMai sat for many artists during his stay, including the Royal Academician Nathaniel Dance. In Dance’s portrait, Mai carries a feather necklace and a wooden stool from home. He later gifted this stool to his voyager friend Tobias Furneaux, whose descendants in turn sold it in 1986 to the Musée de Tahiti. Dance depicted Mai in tapa cloths and with tattooed hand-markings similar to those shown in Joshua Reynolds’s portrait.",

Following his departure, a group of colonists raised funds for the creation of a portrait.

Those who contributed funds towards the portrait gained a printed copy in return, this mezzotint being based on one of the two of Grant’s paintings now belonging to the State Library of Victoria. \\n\\nA self-taught artist, Grant exhibited some 250 portraits at the Royal Academy, of which he was president from 1866 until 1878.

In 1856 the family moved to Yarra Cottage at Carrington on the north-west shore of Port Stephens, where she made this portrait of her six children. For many women of Maria’s class, painting and sketching were both a useful form of personal recordkeeping and a signifier of leisure and propriety. ‘Ladies might do much to assist their husbands in the arduous task of establishing themselves securely and agreeably in a new country,’ stated a 1849 guide for Australian Agricultural Company employees. ‘The good conduct of home matters must depend on them just as much there as anywhere else.’ Accordingly, Maria Brownrigg’s only known work documents a dignified Victorian drawing room, and in its meticulous, time-consuming execution it speaks volumes about notions of femininity. For this reason, and despite their supposedly ‘amateur’ status, works like this are highly prized by curators and historians for their richness of detail about costume, interiors and decorative arts; and for what they reveal about the colonists’ aspirations to gentility.",

After an appalling childhood in Ireland, France and Switzerland, he scraped through military school. He served four years in Palestine from 1874, and, having become fluent in Arabic, distinguished himself as an intelligence officer in the Sudan. Later, he trained up the Egyptian army to recapture Sudan from the Dervishes. Ruthlessly, he deployed British forces against the Boers in South Africa; those who persist in regarding ‘Breaker’ Morant as a hero still blame Kitchener for the execution of Morant and Peter Handcock in 1902. After some years commanding India’s army, he came to Australia to advise on the country’s defence forces. The ‘Kitchener Report’, written during a rapid 1909–1910 tour, laid down the structure of the Australian military and also the nature of the military academy, which became Duntroon. As secretary of state for war (and the famously moustachioed ‘face’ of World War 1) it was Kitchener, under pressure, who sent troops to the Dardanelles; thus, he committed the Anzacs, under the command of his protégé, William Birdwood, to Gallipoli. Many agonising months later, Kitchener approved the evacuation. He died in June 1916 when the ship on which he was travelling hit a German mine; his body was never found.",

After the war he became the first president of the Citizen Military Forces Association (later the Army Reserve). Having formed Australia’s first unit trust before the war, in 1950 he formed Australia’s first merchant bank, Mainguard (Australia) Ltd. Over time he became the president of Austcare, the Refugee Council of Australia, the Australian Jewish Welfare Society for Refugees and the Royal Blind Society of New South Wales. In 1981 he received the Nansen Medal from the United Nations, in recognition of his work on behalf of refugees. \\n\\nMathew Lynn painted this forthright portrait of Cullen over a series of meetings at Cullen’s grazing property in the Southern Highlands, and in his own studio in Sydney. On one occasion he rode out with Cullen to muster some cattle. The old soldier rounded them up, but asked Lynn to count them, as his sight was no longer what it was. Later he joked that Lynn is a better painter than horseman.",

Between 1953 and 1972 Rosewall won four Australian, two French and two US singles championship titles. Coached in Sydney by Harry Hopman, and sardonically nicknamed 'Muscles' on account of his slight stature, he won his first major titles, the Australian and French singles, in 1953 at the age of eighteen. At the close of the 1977 season, aged forty-three, he was still ranked number twelve in the game. Rosewall turned professional in 1957 and became the second player (after Rod Laver) to earn more than a million dollars from tennis, but the ban on professionals from 1957 to 1967 precluded his participation in many Grand Slam events. Asked about tennis in 1977 he said 'it's something I enjoy and find I still do well'. Rosewall was inducted into the international Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980, and its Australian counterpart in 1995.\\n\\nIreland-born Sinead Davies studied at the Byam Shaw School in London and moved to Sydney in 1983.

He achieved his first major success with 'Bring Larks and Heroes' (1967), a novel about the Vinegar Hill convict uprising of 1804, based on the writings of Watkin Tench. It won the Miles Franklin Award, as did his next novel, 'Three Cheers for the Paraclete' (1968). His 1972 novel, 'The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith', won several awards and was made into a film in 1978. In 1982 he became the first Australian author to win the Booker Prize, with 'Schindler’s Ark', filmed by Steven Spielberg as 'Schindler’s List' (1993). His numerous non-fiction titles include a biography of Abraham Lincoln, and books on aspects of Irish history including 'Now and in Time to Be' (1991) and 'The Great Shame' (1998). In 2014, he published 'Australians: Flappers to Vietnam', the third installment of a multi-volume history of Australia. His many novels include 'The Tyrant’s Novel' (2004), 'The Widow and Her Hero' (2007), 'The Daughters of Mars' (2012) and, most recently, 'Crimes of the Father' (2016). \\n\\nLike the portraits of Don Bradman and Barry Humphries, this work was in Gordon Darling’s personal collection before he donated it to the National Portrait Gallery.",

The first draft, at the rate of, if possible, 1000 to 1500 words a day, but that’s not always possible.\\n\\nI’m always having blackouts, losses of confidence, losses of vital energy. However, I’m convinced that the writing of a novel is not an inspirational business and can be done efficiently, and in fact must be done efficiently, by applying yourself to it every morning. I therefore attempt to write about at least 1000 words a morning. I write all morning – this is for the past two years – write all morning, go to school in the afternoon, come home, generally write again. I still am plagued by the good old Irish Catholic guilt and feel that I should work every night. But night work is usually ineffectual, disastrous, hard to settle to, not worth much when it is done. Of course, there’s no one way – I’ve found this out by questioning, asking other novelists as I do shamelessly, specially to overseas visitors – there’s no one way of writing a novel. And some people do, like myself, feel that once they’ve got that first draft done in totality, then they’ve got some chance of fixing the thing up and even adding extra material.",

I’m sure that sometimes it’s nearly as crude as wanting to express the past and wanting to exorcise it in combination with wanting to be recognised as a good expresser and exorcisor of the past.\\n\\nI think the unlikely backgrounds that most novelists have is an indication of the possibility that they have taken to writing out of an attempt to adjust their own unsatisfactory lives, a sort of breaking new ground and adjusting to some almost indigestible break or disaster or failure in their past. Well to be frank, I know this is the reason I started writing, of course, to adjust a balance in my own life, to find a place, a voice in Australia. Since I began to get even the tiniest recognition as a writer, I felt I had a stake in Australia. For years after I left the seminary, until I did start to have work published, I felt an alien in the streets of Sydney. It’s a strange, brash city and it’s a bad city to be an alien in. It’s only since I’ve started to, in particular since I got a sense of responsibility towards writing and began to see what direction Bring Larks and Heroes was travelling in and began to see that I might be expressing something of importance for Australians, that I felt a big stake in Australia, a place amongst the Australian people.",

Engaged before Mawson left for the perilous 1911 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, they eventually married in March 1914. Their first of their two daughters was born in 1915; she remained in Australia when Paquita went to England to assist Mawson in his wartime role with the Ministry of Munitions. Their second child was born in London in 1917. After the war, the family settled in Adelaide, where Paquita worked for the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association, including nine years as president, and the Australian Red Cross Society. Notable for her community work, Paquita was equally prominent in Adelaide's social and cultural life. She also wrote two books: biographies of her father, _A Vision of Steel_ (1958), and her husband, _Mawson of the Antarctic_ (1964).\\n\\nIt is thought that this portrait of Paquita Mawson came about when she was invited to pose for one of Ingrid Erns' art classes in Adelaide. In the portrait the sitter is striking and elegant, depicted seated and in profile, wearing an elaborate embroidered shawl. The painting remained in the Mawson family until being donated to the National Portrait Gallery in 2010.",

At age four, following her father’s death, her mother took her family to Adelaide, where Ivy later trained as a seamstress. She then moved to Sydney, marrying financier Ray Shore in 1938. In the late 1950s, she enrolled in painting classes with Graeme Inson, a disciple of Max Meldrum’s, and on separating from her husband in 1960 brought her own house in Woollahra. In 1962, soon after she was widowed, Inson moved in. Through the 1960s, Shore developed her own style as a portrait painter, but, not wanting to compete with Inson, eschewed entering the Archibald Prize. Instead, she focused her efforts on the Portia Geach Memorial Award for women artists, entering it for the first time in 1976 and winning in 1979 with a portrait of trade unionist Della Elliott. Shore used her prize-money to have a studio built above the garage of her house, so that she could paint away from Inson and his disapproval of her ‘non-Meldrumite’ style. Shore continued to exhibit in the Portia Geach Award until 1992 and died in Sydney in 1999.",

                    "content": "Christine Audrey Pecket (1908–1996) was five when she contracted poliomyelitis, relying on braces and crutches and many years of painful orthopaedic treatments. Despite these challenges, Pecket determined on becoming an artist. From around 1934, and with financial assistance from the NSW Society for Crippled Children, she completed a diploma at East Sydney Technical College. Her solo exhibition in 1937 included over 60 works. She established a studio in Castlereagh Street, Sydney, where she painted and offered tuition. Later she focused on pottery, establishing a studio at her home in Ashfield, teaching, and producing a range of slip-cast decorative objects under the 'Christine Ware' label. In 1955 Pecket moved to her own home in Cammeray, where she later built a studio and returned to painting, sculpting and teaching.\\n\\nThis self portrait confirms accounts of Pecket's strong will and her dedication in the face of considerable obstacles. In a review of her graduating exhibition in the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 December 1937, she said: 'Disabilities are supposed to take everything from life, to leave it hollow and empty. But they don't. They make you try all the harder. One makes up one's mind to succeed despite the odds, and one does.' A photograph of Pecket at work on the portrait appeared alongside the article.",

He went on to participate in many exploratory voyages and oversaw the establishment of the Australian Antarctic Division’s research stations – Mawson, Casey and Davis. He was Director of the Antarctic Division of the Department of External Affairs from 1949 to 1966; during that period, he and his colleagues mapped more than 3000 miles of coastline and some 800 000 square miles of territory. Law's wife, Nel, was the first Australian woman to visit Antarctica. President of the Royal Society of Victoria from 1967 to 1969, Law was active for many years in tertiary education, marine science and public life, and authored several books about his Antarctic investigations and adventures. His honours include the Royal Geographical Society's Founders Medal, former recipients of which include Douglas Mawson and Jane Franklin. Law died at age 97; his ashes, and Nel's, were later interred near Mawson Station.",

She married David Johnston-Bell, who was serving with Lord Mountbatten; they became friends with the Langhammers, and collected works by the artists in the Progressive School. After moving to Australia in 1950 the Johnston-Bells bought magazines including The Australian Collector, which under Andree's editorship soon became something of a collector's item in itself. One of her triumphs was the publication of previously-unseen engravings of botanical specimens collected by Banks and Solander. In retirement, she translated seventeenth-century French manuscripts. \\n\\nWalter Langhammer fled the Nazis in Austria for India, becoming first art director of the Times of India in about 1936. He was soon surrounded by an 'in crowd' of fellow European refugees - professionals, artists, doctors and industrialists - who became important patrons of contemporary artists in Bombay.",

The son of a doctor, Elliott grew up in Bellingen, New South Wales, and was educated at Scot's College in Sydney. After war service with the Royal Australian Navy, he studied medicine at the University of Sydney, and decided to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology in 1950 after witnessing Betty Sara become the first Australian woman to be successfully delivered of quadruplets (Elliot's father delivered them). Having undertaken further study in London, in due course he became head of gynaecological oncology at Sydney’s King George V Hospital, and president of both the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Asian and Oceanic Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. For many years, Elliott worked as a volunteer in Asia and Oceania; and during his career he published over 150 research papers and delivered more than 250 lectures by invitation. In his spare time, he pursued his passion for art collecting, enjoying close relationships with gallery owners and artists, including Fred Williams, William Robinson, Frank Hodgkinson and Russell Drysdale.\\n\\nElliott commissioned this portrait from artist Jon Molvig in 1964. It was gifted to the National Portrait Gallery by the sitter's son in 2016, along with five of Molvig's preparatory drawings for the work.",

In 1929 he went as a biologist on a scientific survey party, sent from England at the request of the New Zealand government, to examine and report on aspects of the export lamb trade. Two years later he became officer in charge of the food preservation and transport section of CSIR at Cannon Hill, Brisbane. The primary objective of the section was to find a viable way to send chilled beef to Britain. In 1938 the section moved to Sydney, where further research into cold storage of diverse foods was carried out. In 1940 the section was raised to the status of a division with Vickery as its chief. In the next few years, owing to demands for supplies from the American forces in the Pacific, the section was expanded.; Vickery became the man in demand as wartime food supply problems intensified, and dehydrated meat for Allied forces became known as ‘Vickery mutton’. Vickery was careful to maintain close relations with the food industry, fostering good practice and innovation. He set up an education committee to implement the the first food technology courses in Australia at Hawkesbury Agricultural College and Sydney Technical College, and encouraged his staff to teach in them. Having travelled widely to observe food research establishments in many countries, Vickery became internationally recognised as one of the fathers of his profession; he was a member of the international committee that initiated the International Union of Food Science and Technology (IUFoST) and an honorary fellow of the UK Institute of Food Science and Technology. The Institute of Food Technologists conferred on him its International Award for 1960 for _‘outstanding efforts to promote international exchange of ideas in the field of food technology’_. By the time he retired in 1967, the division was housed in new laboratories at North Ryde and Cannon Hill. In retirement Vickery returned to the laboratory, publishing original research on cyclopropenoid fatty acids which cause pink/white disorder in eggs. In 1990 he published his comprehensive book _Food Science and Technology in Australia. Warmly remembered for his integrity, commitment and enlightened administration, he is commemorated in the JR Vickery Address, delivered at the annual convention of the Australian Institute of Food Science and Technology._ __",

After winning the Wimbledon singles final in 1987, he famously scaled the stands to embrace the occupants of his player’s box, initiating what became something of a standard Wimbledon victory celebration. In retirement, Cash has worked as a coach, broadcaster and commentator. A co-founder of environmental organisation Planet Ark, he is an advocate for the work of charities including the Starlight Children’s Foundation and the Make-a-Wish Foundation, among others.

As principal dancer for Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet, London Festival Ballet (now the English National Ballet) and Deutsche Oper Ballet Berlin, Benjamin performed classics such as _Swan Lake_, _The Nutcracker_ and _Giselle_, while creating new characters for contemporary ballets to great acclaim. Benjamin joined the Royal Ballet in 1992, becoming the company's longest-serving principal ballerina.\\n\\nIn preparation for this portrait, taken at the height of her career, Benjamin recalls being asked by Polly Borland to dye the tools of her trade – her pointe shoes – red. Sitting against a wall in a black practice tutu with her feet turned out, Benjamin's pointe shoes recall the enchanted red ballet slippers of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale that later formed the basis of the 1948 film, _The Red Shoes_.",

'More often than not, [shoots] are for glossy magazines and they try to sell you as a certain type of image, it's pretty rare when they actually want you to be seen as yourself,' Collette said when the portrait was first exhibited.",

Williams is seated with eyes closed – his focus turned inwards. The artist appears to capture that moment between poses, and we imagine the musician listening to a melody plucked out by an unseen hand.\\n\\nBorn in Melbourne, Williams began guitar lessons with his father Len Williams, and from the age of 11 attended summer schools with the Spanish maestro Andrés Segovia in Italy. Educated at London's Royal College of Music, in 1958 he gave his first professional guitar performance and recorded two albums. He has been performing and recording worldwide ever since. Renowned for his interpretation of the classical guitar repertoire, Williams is also a composer and has explored other musical genres including pop, jazz, world music, folk and rock. Williams has featured on numerous recordings, including the film scores for _The Deer Hunter_ and _A Fish Called Wanda_.",

He began his career in the 1993 film _The Heartbreak Kid_, alongside Claudia Karvan, and later starred in the spin-off television series _Heartbreak High_. In 1998, he took on a significantly grittier role as the protagonist of the film _Head On_, adapted from Christos Tsiolkas' novel _Loaded_. His performance was critically acclaimed and earned him an AFI Award nomination. He went on to appear in many films, plays and television shows including _The Slap_ (2011), for which he won the AACTA for Best Lead Actor in a television series. In 2016 he won the Logie for Most Outstanding Actor for _The Principal_ (2015). Recent television credits include _Tidelands_ (2018), _The Cry_ (2018) and _Amazing Grace_ (2021).\\n\\nAs an Australian-Greek man of a similar age, Michael Zavros had long been interested in painting Dimitriades. He painted this work for the 2005 Archibald Prize, employing a stark white background to focus attention on the actor's 'dark hooded eyes and intense stare.' 'He's a good-looking man', Zavros explained, 'but I wanted to avoid any kind of reference to the Greek Adonis ideal.'",

In 1976, Anderson joined the band Rose Tattoo, who gained a solid following on the pub circuit before releasing their first album in late 1978. Incorporating the hit single ‘Bad Boy for Love’, Rose Tattoo remains one of the classic Australian rock albums. It reached number one on the UK heavy metal charts, as did its followup, Assault and Battery. The Tatts were a major influence on American heavy-metal band Guns N’ Roses, who insisted that the band re-form in 1993 to support them on their Sydney and Melbourne gigs; Angry and Guns N’ Roses frontman Slash appeared together again in Australia in 2010. Rose Tattoo disbanded in 1987; that year, Anderson’s solo hit ‘Suddenly’ was used as the backing track for Charlene’s and Scott’s wedding on Neighbours. Having already appeared in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985), Anderson took on further dramatic roles, notably that of Herod in the arena spectacular Jesus Christ Superstar (1992). Since the 1980s, he has been an outspoken social commentator, appearing regularly on A Current Affair, for example. The one-time face of Australian prostate cancer research, in the leadup to the Federal election in 2016 he sought a Senate seat, saying ‘We have strict quarantine laws and it should be the same when it comes to cultures that do not want to integrate . . .

In 1921 the family moved to Melbourne, where they were to operate the Lindrum billiard hall for decades. Walter and his brother were coached by their father, Frederick, who, according to Walter, was the best billiard player in the pre-World War 1 world. Walter’s brother Frederick, too, was brilliant at the game, but fate saw Walter emerge as the dominant player internationally. In 1929 he went to England, where he quickly established himself as the greatest the world had seen. He made his largest competitive break, of 4 137, in 1932. The 1930s were his peak years; he won the world billiards championship in 1933 and retained the title throughout the decade. In the 1940s, he abandoned competitive play. Apart from writing about billiards, in his later years he applied himself to raising funds for Melbourne charities. His much-visited grave in Melbourne General Cemetery is in the form of a billiards tabletop, complete with cue and balls. \\n\\nWill Longstaff (1879–1953) grew up in Ballarat, where he studied art at the School of Mines before embarking for the Boer War. Proceeding to Europe, he attended art school in London. He joined the Australian Imperial Force in 1915, serving in Egypt before being invalided to England, where he was appointed a war artist and worked in camouflage and the Australian War Records Section. His best-known painting, Menin Gate at Midnight (1927) hangs in a curtained shrine-like space in the Australian War Memorial. A resident of England for the rest of his life, Longstaff undertook many portrait commissions. He is thought to have painted Lindrum in London in 1932, the year Lindrum made his record break.",

Fleeing from Nazi Germany to Paris when he was seventeen, he changed his name to Georges Mora. During the war he took an active role in the Resistance; when peace came, he worked as a patent dealer. He married Mirka Zelik, a French-born Jewish artist, in 1947 and the couple migrated to Melbourne with their first son, Philippe in 1951. Two more sons, William and Tiriel, followed. Soon the couple became friends with the city’s leading artists and collectors, including the Reeds, and were instrumental in the re- formation of the Contemporary Art Society. Over the course of the 1950s and 1960s they opened the European-style Mirka Café in Exhibition Street (the first Melbourne café with outdoor seating), the Balzac in East Melbourne (the first restaurant with a licence to serve liquor after 10pm) and the Tolarno in St Kilda. While Georges established himself as an art dealer as well as a restaurateur, Mirka became a Bohemian icon of the city. The couple separated in the early 1970s. In 1985 Georges married another artist, Caroline Williams, and they had a son, Sam, born in the same year. Made a Chevalier des Arts et Lettres in 1989, Georges was still operating the Tolarno Gallery in South Yarra when he died. William Mora can lay claim to being one of only three second-generation art dealers in business in Australia today. The Georges Mora Foundation, launched by Dame Elisabeth Murdoch in 2006, is a not-for-profit cultural foundation dedicated to the promotion of contemporary art and artists in Melbourne and Australia.\\n\\nThis portrait is one of three that Charles Blackman made when he and Georges Mora were working together at the Eastbourne Cafe (later the Balzac). Blackman’s former wife, Barbara, comments that it is akin to a self portrait, as she recalls that artist and sitter looked very alike.",

After learning watercolour technique, he was persuaded to exhibit his work in Melbourne in 1938. The exhibition sold out in two days. During the 1940s his work became fashionable throughout Australia and he was the subject of a biography and a film. In 1954 he met the Queen in Canberra, and he was awarded citizenship status in 1957. One of the consequences of citizenship was that Namatjira was legally entitled to buy alcohol, but when he shared it with his fellow Arrernte, as custom required, he was sentenced to imprisonment. Although the sentence was commuted, he never recovered, and died the following year. Nearly 50 years after his death, Namatjira remains the best-known of Australian Aboriginal painters.\\n\\nThe prolific portraitist Sir William Dargie CBE (1912–2003) knew, and had painted with, Albert Namatjira. In 1956 Dargie won one of his eight Archibald Prizes with a portrait of Namatjira, whose ‘tremendous inner dignity,’ he said, contributed to ‘the most wonderful face for a portrait I’ve ever seen’.",

His figure takes up most of the composition against a distant desert background. \\n\\nThe bright blue desert sky fills the top two thirds of the background around and above Namatjira. In lively and breezy, mostly vertical, strokes, the painted sky starts in bold cerulean at the top of the painting and fades to sapphire and powder blue where it meets the distant purple mountains. Some horizontal paint strokes hint at faint clouds.\\n\\nLand occupies the lower third of the background. In the far distance a blurred mountain range of purples and dark blue runs along the horizon. The flat dirt is rendered in pale peachy oranges. Small blue green dashes and dots of paint suggest sparse and distant vegetation.\\n\\nNamatjira's seated figure, cropped at the shins, fills the foreground. His head is positioned in profile facing the left. His skin is warm shades of dark brown and umber. He has short black hair, thick and wavy, flecked with grey, which neatly follows the shape of his large ear. His forehead angles diagonally toward his prominent brow, creased gently with wrinkles. He has a bushy raised eyebrow, and deeply set brown eye gazing into the distance. His nose is straight and upturned, his mouth slightly open. He has strong cheekbones leading to plump jowls and a thick neck, around which sits a thin red bandana tucked into his white button-up shirt.\\n\\nNamatjira's body is turned slightly towards the left, following his gaze. His left arm is bent at the elbow, the forearm leaning casually on his left thigh, his hand and fingers gently hanging down. Between this hand and his raised right hand, he gently holds a sketch of a landscape, resting on his lap, and angled away from his body. The paper faces towards us directly, showing a watery sketch of a landscape scene. A large tree on the right with grey green foliage, bright blue mountains in the background and pale peachy orange dirt in the foreground. \\n\\nNamatjira has dark taupe pants, his knees are parted, and he sits on a low reddish-brown rock.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Marina Neilson and voiced by Lucie Shawcross, 2021**",

After immigrating, he worked as a waiter while studying fashion design at East Sydney TAFE and Sydney’s National Art School. In 1993 he opened the Akira Isogawa boutique in Woollahra, and swiftly established a reputation for his bold and intelligent clothes. At Sydney’s Australian Fashion Week in 1996, he sent all his models out wearing red socks from Gowings because he couldn’t afford shoes for them; but he has shown at every Fashion Week since, and since 1998 he has shown twice annually in Paris. He has exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art, and Sydney’s Object Gallery’s exhibition of his construction techniques is said to have been its most successful ever show. The National Gallery of Victoria’s _Akira Isogawa: Printemps Eté_ in 2004-2005 was the first solo exhibition of an Australian designer’s work to be shown at one of its major art institutions and later toured to Singapore, Manila and Bangkok. In 2005 Isogawa was depicted on the ‘Australian Legends’ series of postage stamps and in 2007 he was named the country’s first Fashion Laureate. He has designed costumes for four Sydney Dance Company productions and for the Australian Ballet’s production of Graeme Murphy’s _Romeo and Juliet_ in 2010. Sydney’s Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences showed the retrospective _Akira Isogawa_ at 2018-2019. Since the Woollahra boutique closed in 2017, Australia’s only two Akira boutiques are in the Strand Arcade, Sydney, and Fortitude Valley, Brisbane.",

Well now actually I create fashion. But back then, actually, I was consuming fashion and that's how much I loved [it].  \\nJapanese culture is so different from Western ones. My grandparents had a house next door. They were all wearing actually traditional clothes – kimono. What I noticed about kimono is actually they're made out rectangular shaped cloth. And they have no shapes. Whereas actually, Western clothes has a particular shape that enhance, particularly actually for female, the femininity of female body, but whereas actually kimono is totally unisex. I mean, I've never actually designed kimono myself. But being a kimono designer, I imagine actually, they work on texture, colour, print, and so on, because it's a highly textile driven fashion, and then to me, that's what Japanese fashion is all about. You know, when I design my own collection, I never really force myself to express my Japanese entity, but I feel that it just comes up naturally. And I think what's interesting is that not just, you know, designing something so traditionally Japanese, but then I kind of actually manage to fuse with Australian ease I guess actually. Australia has got this particular attitude – friendly to start with – but it's quite actually casual about things, you know. I feel actually my design is a result of actually, you know, some Japanese heritage with Australian attitude, which is actually friendly and easy.",

After arriving in Australia in 1980 she worked as a translator of Chinese language films and with ABC radio in Darwin and Newcastle before joining SBS as a newsreader in 1988, gaining devoted viewers through her stern delivery and superbly-cut tops and jackets. As host of the network's _Fashionista_ program she built a reputation as a style authority, in 2008 curating the National Archives of Australia exhibition of historical fashion photographs, _Strike a Pose … With Lee Lin Chin_. Known also as a comedian and a voice for social change, she has a huge social media following although she posts little, if anything, herself, retaining an intriguing air of mystery. Among the causes Chin supports is The Social Studio, an enterprise dedicated to creating employment and educational pathways for young people who have been refugees.\\n\\nPhotographer Ingvar Kenne spent a couple of hours with Lee Lin Chin in her friend's painting studio, and they went outside late in the afternoon so he could take 'one last shot' – this one. He recalls 'we all ended up at the pub afterwards exchanging tales.' She is pictured in a dress by Japanese-born Australian designer Akira Isogawa.",

After the war she spent time in Europe, furthering her studies at the London Central and Hammersmith Art Schools and travelling and sketching in France, Italy, Spain and south-west England. She held her first solo exhibition after returning to Sydney in 1956 and the same year became a member of the newly-formed Potters Society with whom she also exhibited. During the same period she joined the National Trust of Australia (NSW), later becoming a member of its council (1961–76) and executive (1961–63). She also served on the Trust's women’s committee and as a member of the survey committee worked to identify and classify the colonial architectural heritage of New South Wales. A school art teacher for over twenty years, Roxburgh also wrote several articles and books on colonial Australian architecture.",

The corners are raised and decorated in a foliage design. \\n\\nThe portrait’s strong, striped background in cool colours contrasts with a sensitive depiction of the figure of Rachel Roxburgh. Seated on a settee, rendered in warm peaches and creams Rachel’s image is cropped at the bust, filling the majority of the canvas.\\n\\nThe background is a vertical repeating design of thick taupe, teal and almost-black lines. An unseen object casts a faint shadow behind her right shoulder. Just the curve of a reddish-brown high-backed settee is partially shown behind her left shoulder. \\n\\nHer brunette hair is pulled off her face, elegantly piled on her head in a loose rolled wave, revealing her ears. She has a high forehead with lightly arched brown brows and deep hooded round, light green eyes.\\n\\nShe gazes intently outwards over our right shoulder. Her complexion is creamy, with her nose and cheeks a blushing peach. Her full lips are coated in a vivid coral lipstick. Her chin and jawline are softly rounded and also flushed pink. The arch of her eyebrows and slight upturn of the upper lip makes her appear thoughtful.  \\n  \\nRachel wears a cream pussy-bow blouse with an understated white floral design and a line of greyish buttons. Puff sleeves stop midway down her upper arm, emphasising her broad shoulders. On the garment, taupe and dusky pink shadows emphasise the loosely draping neckline and the trail of buttons down her front. \\n\\nA signature in bright red is painted in the bottom right, A. E. Perry, 39. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Alana Sivell and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

After her daughter started school, Rehfisch returned to painting, studying at Antonio Dattilo-Rubbo’s atelier, where she met artist George Duncan. She held her first exhibition in 1929 and began exhibiting with the Society of Artists in 1931. By this time, she and her husband had separated. Heading to London in 1933, she studied at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art. Rehfisch once said she approached painting not as ‘a superficial rendering of the thing we see in front of us, [but] trying to get the spirit behind all that’. Accordingly, this self portrait captures someone known for her sartorial flair as well as a sense of the independent, modern identity she forged as an artist in London.\\n\\nIn 1938, Rehfisch returned to Sydney, where she and Duncan married in 1942. From 1939 until 1969, she exhibited regularly in solo and group shows. She was particularly known for her still lifes and flowerpieces, often painted on hessian and always in a post-impressionist style that employed rhythmic, structured composition, simple forms and a bold yet harmonious use of colour.",

It was then that I really did start to work. He was a wonderful teacher. He realised I was an unconventional, peculiar sort of person really, and he rather encouraged it, not always approving but always sympathetic and helpful. It was there that I met my present husband, who has always been a help to me, with his encouragement and criticism and so on, George Duncan.\\n\\nI worked seriously for years and years and from that day to now I’ve never ceased to paint.\\n\\nWithin the last few years, I’ve been extraordinarily interested in an ecological approach, which is the balance of life and place. I wanted to balance my subjects with something behind it, something deeper behind it. I think my early childhood feelings about trying to get behind things had something to do with it. It’s always been with me, always been interested in the other side of things. But somehow or other it’s terribly difficult to get right behind things, as I think every artist should do. After all, its’ not just a superficial rendering of the things we see in front of us, it’s trying to get the spirit behind all that and join it up with something, another life that isn’t quite only of this world, and I expect I shall go along those lines for quite a while yet.\\n\\nUsually, when I’m painting anything at all, things come to me. I’m slightly psychic, and things come to me in that peculiar period just between waking and sleeping. I see the whole composition, the colour scheme, the feeling of the thing, but I have to work out the detail, of course, physically, myself, afterwards; but the whole general feeling of the thing usually comes to me, and I never start an important work unless that happens because I find it’s never any use at all.",

Born at Indulkana in the APY Lands in South Australia, she was removed from her mother at the age of two and raised in a children’s home run by missionaries at Quorn in the Flinders Ranges. She recollects that she became rebellious at a young age after hearing her culture being denigrated. ‘I was always asking the question about who am I, where did I come from, who’s my mother and who’s my father, and where are they? Never got any answers to any of that at all,’ she says. At 16 she got a job as a nanny. Encouraged to become a nurse, she applied for a traineeship and was – eventually – accepted, becoming the first Aboriginal woman to complete her nursing training at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. She worked there until the early 1960s, and also travelled to remote communities, learning about her heritage through ‘just doing what I could to heal people’. She joined the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1967 and by 1975 she had become its regional director in South Australia. In 1977 she was elected Foundation Chair of the National Aboriginal Conference, formed under prime minister Malcolm Fraser as a peak body to advise the Federal government on Indigenous affairs, and she chaired the Aboriginal Development Commission from 1989 to 1990. Named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1983, she was Australian of the Year in 1984, and in 1999 she was named a Companion of the Order of Australia. In 2005 she was invested by Pope John Paul II as a Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great. While Chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission between 1990 and 1996, she helped to draft the Mabo legislation. The holder of six honorary doctorates, she was the patron of the Lowitja Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research. In 2022, on her 90th birthday, the Lowitja Institute formed the Lowitja O’Donoghue Foundation to continue and preserve her legacy.\\n\\nRobert Hannaford said of O'Donoghue that he observed a 'vast understanding and sympathy in her face, a sadness', but also thought she looked 'fantastic in that light I've got in that studio'. The pair became friends during the many hours of sittings involved in creating the work.",

But I quickly got to know him and respect him, and I knew that by the questioning and so on that he was really trying to find out more about me. So, I’m not sure that he knew much about [the] Stolen Generation. After I saw the portrait come out, I myself felt the portrait wasn’t like me because Robert had told me very early in the piece that I wasn’t to smile. He doesn’t like smiling portraits. People who know me of course know that I do smile a lot.\\n\\nThe suit that I wore on the day, I think he was a bit surprised because it was really quite formal and it’s a suit that I wear when I receive the many awards that I’ve received over the years. My family had no difficulty at all seeing me turn up in that same suit. And because it was a portrait, I thought, well, you know, I’m an Aboriginal woman and I’m going to wear the Aboriginal flag, and I’m going to wear everything red, black and yellow.\\n\\nI’m much more proud of the fact that I’m a nurse and that I was able to use my nursing experience to actually travel to remote areas in my own, well in my own right, just doing what I could to heal people. I didn’t know my people very well and so on, this is one way of getting to know them out on the APY lands. I have had a lot of senior jobs, met just so many people in high places, really. And I enjoyed seeing them but they weren’t the most important things in my life. It was really about making a difference.",

The work measures about 1.4 m tall by 1.4 m wide, set in its wide frame of dark wood. The portrait is painted realistically with loosely applied brushstrokes. Lowitja wears a bright red skirt-suit and is seated in front of a dark background.\\n\\nThe scene is lit from the top left. Lowitja is illuminated in a soft pool of light filling the top right and centre of the painting. Pale green-grey and blue-grey brush strokes at the top right curve around and down towards the bottom left, their direction changing, sweeping around and getting darker towards the lower edge of the canvas.\\n\\nLowitja sits on a dark wood chair in the centre of the image. The rounded corners of its back rise above each of her shoulders. Her head is tilted slightly down to her left with her chin angled up. Lowitja’s silvery hair is short, parted on the side, and styled in a wave over her forehead. Her skin is in warm honey tones and her cheeks are tinged pink. Lowitja has fine steeply-arched eyebrows above her dark eyes that gaze directly at us. Her nose is broad and deep grooves flow from it to the outer edges of her thin rosy lips. Her lips are closed and slightly downturned, creating soft jowels which frame her broad chin.\\n\\nIn the portrait Lowitja wears a loosley-fitted long jacket that runs down her lap to her knees. It has an Aboriginal Flag pin on the left lapel and is open, with three large round gold buttons gleaming brightly down its left side. A strand of black red and yellow beads and an oval shaped Aboriginal Flag pendant on a fine chain stand out against her black round-necked top.\\n\\nLowitja’s elbows rest lightly on the carved wooden arms of the chair and her hands lie with fingers extended in her lap. On the ring finger of her left hand she wears a wide yellow-gold band, while on her right a ring is set with a large black rectangular stone.\\n\\nLowitja’s red skirt extends over her knees and out of frame. The same red has been used by the artist to sign ‘Hannaford 06’ on the bottom right of the canvas.\\n\\nAudio description written by Lucinda Shawcross and voiced by Amy Middleby",

This work is a testament to his vision, his beauty and his bravery.",

The school provides children from some of the poorest and most marginalised communities with high-quality education, meals, books and uniforms to help break the cycle of poverty.\\n\\nThis portrait of Abraham was taken against a simple white background designed to emulate a large billboard.

After university, where they both studied photography – Will at Edith Cowan University and Garrett at the Queensland College of Art – the artists gravitated to Melbourne where they met in 2006. The pair soon began to collaborate as The Huxleys, combining their separate practices of photography, filmmaking and costume design, with performance as a key element. Inspired by the attention-grabbing and the outrageous, the artists embrace the glamourous, the absurd and the provocative and in doing so challenge convention; the Huxleys persuade their audience to consider notions of gender, social mores and non-conformity. The artists have become part of a contemporary cohort of collaborating duos, which includes the British pair Gilbert and George, and Australia's Charles Green and Lyndal Brown. The Huxleys continue to be in demand across the country and internationally, invited to work at the Art Gallery of South Australia, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Museum of Brisbane, National Gallery of Victoria, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Heide Museum of Modern Art, Arts Centre Melbourne, Australian Centre for the Moving Image, the Mona Foma festival in Tasmania and Sydney Contemporary. They were the inaugural 'Disrupters in Residence' at HOTA on the Gold Coast, and were included in a select group of Australian artists invited to participate in the City of Melbourne's UPTOWN. Internationally they have performed and exhibited in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Moscow and Berlin."

                    "content": "Omai (Mai) (c. 1750-1778), the first Polynesian to visit Britain, was a young man of middling social standing who volunteered to sail from Huahine to England with Captain Furneaux on the Adventure (the ship accompanying James Cook's Resolution on Cook's second voyage of discovery (1772-1775). On board the Adventure - where he was known variously as Tetuby Homey, or Jack - Omai was tutored in English by the brother of Fanny Burney, the diarist, novelist and friend of Samuel Johnson and Joshua Reynolds. Arriving at Spithead in 1774 he was greeted by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Sandwich, and placed in the care of Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, who were amongst the few able to communicate with him. He was ubiquitous on the London social scene in 1774-1776, being presented at Court to George III, enjoying the close attentions of society ladies and staying at Hinchingbrooke, the country house of Lord and Lady Sandwich. Omai returned to his birthplace with James Cook on his third voyage (on the Resolution) in 1776. By the time Cook was killed on that voyage in 1779, Omai is also thought to have died, sadly isolated despite Cook's strong efforts to establish him comfortably and promote his social re-acceptance. Omai had perfectly encapsulated conflicting philosophical ideas of the Enlightenment. On one hand, he was the first 'wild' visitor satisfactorily to embody Rousseau's ideal of the 'noble savage', untainted by the corrupting influences of contemporary social life. On the other, opponents of such Romantic sentiment (for instance Dr Johnson), believed it was not surprising that Omai was civil and gentle, as following his arrival in England he had moved only in the best circles. Posthumously, he was the fictionalised hero, with Cook, of the imperialist pantomime OMAI: or, a Trip Round the World, which ran intermittently in London from 1785 to 1788 and was both a popular and critical success."

                    "content": "Trukanini (c. 1812–1876) is arguably nineteenth century Australia’s most celebrated Indigenous leader. A Nuennone woman and the daughter of Mangana, chief of the Recherche Bay people, Trukanini experienced the loss of her mother, sister and intended husband – all as a result of white violence – at a young age. Believing that she might be able to assist in protecting her people, in 1829 Trukanini joined the group of Palawa leaders associated with George Augustus Robinson, an evangelically-inclined free settler who'd been appointed to effect the removal of Tasmania's Aboriginal people to a mission station, Wybalenna, on Flinders Island in Bass Strait. Trukanini remained one of Robinson's most important companions throughout the course of his so-called 'Friendly Mission', the name given to a series of journeys conducted by Robinson between 1830 and 1835. Trukanini went to Wybalenna in 1835, but held to her traditional ways despite the expectation that the Aboriginal people there would adopt European customs and religion. She travelled with Robinson in 1839 to the Port Phillip district, where she later engaged with four others in raids against white settlers. She returned to Flinders Island in 1842; when Wybalenna closed in 1847, Trukanini was among the remaining residents relocated to Oyster Cove, a former convict depot south of Hobart and close to her traditional country. Trukanini died in Hobart in May 1876. As she had feared, her skeleton was stolen from her grave and later displayed at the Tasmanian Museum. The Tasmanian Aboriginal community eventually won the fight to have her wishes honoured: her bones were cremated on the 30th of April 1976 and the following day her ashes were scattered with due ceremony on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Trukanini was erroneously referred to during her lifetime and beyond as the ‘last Tasmanian’ – a false notion attested to by the many descendants of her contemporaries still living in Tasmania today."

In 1829 Wurati decided to join the party associated with George Augustus Robinson (1788–1866), a free settler and lay preacher appointed to the position of ‘Conciliator of Aborigines’ so as to effect the removal of Tasmania’s Indigenous people to Flinders Island in Bass Strait. This strategy had been conceived by the colonial government, amidst escalating hostilities, for the supposed protection of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities alike. Accompanied by a group of Aboriginal leaders who acted as his guides and interpreters, Robinson conducted a series of expeditions – collectively known as the Friendly Mission – between 1830 and 1835, during which the surviving tribes were persuaded into exile. Wurati and his second wife, Trukanini, became Robinson’s trusted assistants, yet remained fiercely proud of their traditions and identity. Wurati refused to adopt European diet or dress and maintained traditional practices, such as the use of ochre and grease for his hair and beard, even while at Wybalenna – the mission station on Flinders Island to which over one hundred Tasmanian Aboriginal people were eventually exiled. Many died there while waiting for the fulfilment of the promise that they would be allowed to return to their country. In 1839, Wurati was one of the fourteen Tasmanians who went to Port Phillip following Robinson’s appointment to the position of Chief Protector of Aborigines in the new colony. He died on his return journey to Wybalenna in July 1842."

On graduation he won the drawing prize and the travelling scholarship.\\n\\nFrom 1973 to 1984 Amor lived in a cottage attached to the home of former National Gallery of Victoria director Daryl Lindsay and his wife Joan, author of _Picnic at Hanging Rock_, painting between carrying out odd jobs for the old couple. During this impecunious period he produced a series of cartoons attacking the Fraser government for the _Labor Star_ and the _Tribune_ and made series of drawings of labourers, construction workers and slaughtermen that were exhibited at the Trades Hall Gallery. \\n\\nFrom 1983 he began to paint more personal and emotionally charged works, often incorporating a haunting ‘solitary watcher’. Some of his brooding, shadowy paintings of suburban and inner Melbourne now number amongst the defining images of the city.\\n\\nAmor won the National Australia Bank Art Prize in 1988, and over the 1990s, awarded several art residencies, he worked in Barcelona, New York and London. By 1999 he had more than twenty solo commercial shows and several regional gallery survey shows to his name. That year, as Australia's first official war artist since Vietnam, he travelled to East Timor to document the devastated land and the reconstruction efforts of peacekeepers. The resulting works are in the collection of the Australian War Memorial. \\n\\nAmor shows regularly in commercial galleries in Melbourne and Brisbane and his paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures are in the collections of most major Australian public galleries.

In 1976, Anderson joined the band Rose Tattoo, who gained a solid following on the pub circuit before releasing their first album in late 1978. Incorporating the hit single ‘Bad Boy for Love’, Rose Tattoo remains one of the classic Australian rock albums. It reached number one on the UK heavy metal charts, as did its followup, Assault and Battery. The Tatts were a major influence on American heavy-metal band Guns N’ Roses, who insisted that the band re-form in 1993 to support them on their Sydney and Melbourne gigs; Angry and Guns N’ Roses frontman Slash appeared together again in Australia in 2010. Rose Tattoo disbanded in 1987; that year, Anderson’s solo hit ‘Suddenly’ was used as the backing track for Charlene’s and Scott’s wedding on Neighbours. Having already appeared in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985), Anderson took on further dramatic roles, notably that of Herod in the arena spectacular Jesus Christ Superstar (1992). Since the 1980s, he has been an outspoken social commentator, appearing regularly on A Current Affair, for example. The single father of four continues to speak out about issues such as violence and discipline, and has been the face of Australian prostate cancer research.In the leadup to the Federal election in 2016 he sought a Senate seat, saying ‘We have strict quarantine laws and it should be the same when it comes to cultures that do not want to integrate . . . If you come here, you should behave yourself – it’s as simple as that.’"

                    "content": "Gordon Andrews (1914-2001) was one of Australia's foremost industrial designers. Working in Britain and Italy as well as Australia, in 1955 he became the first Australian designer to be elected as a Fellow of the UK Society of Industrial Artists and Designers; later he gained membership of the Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry and the Alliance Graphique Internationale. In the early 1960s Andrews designed the interiors for the Australian Pavilion of the Comptoire Suisse trade fair, the New South Wales Government Tourist Bureau, Sydney and the New Zealand Government Tourist Bureau. In 1963 he was invited to submit designs for Australia's new decimal currency notes. The selection committee voted unanimously for Andrews's designs, and on February 14, 1966 his $1, $2, $10 and $20 notes entered circulation. Shortly before their issue, it had been decided that a $5 note would be required too - Andrews was engaged to design it, and also the $50 note when the need for it subsequently arose. When the present-day polymer plastic notes began to replace paper ones in 1992, Andrews served on the advisory panel that oversaw their design. The retrospective exhibition Gordon Andrews: a designer's life, reflecting the breadth of Andrews's involvement in design, was held at the Powerhouse Museum in 1993. Andrews's own monograph Gordon Andrews: A designer's life, was published the same year. Both the book and the exhibition drew predominantly on the extensive Gordon Andrews design archives, acquired by the Powerhouse Museum before bush fires destroyed his home at Lovett Bay, near Sydney's Church Point, in January 1994."

In the original problem of producing the one, two, ten and twenty, I had thought of using Caroline Chisholm on the reverse of the one to go with Her Majesty’s portrait, but the bank knocked that right back. They said, ‘Well, we don’t quite think that Caroline Chisholm is the right person.’ In any case, it wasn’t a very good idea, I think that it was better to have something quite abstract on the back of that one. Finally, then, in the next series, once the first four were published, they then quickly said, ‘Well, we must now produce a five’ which was always intended in the first series. So I put Caroline Chisholm up again and then she was okayed. They’d had time to think about it.\\n\\nFor the two dollar I had two primary production people, I had a wool man and the wheat man, the backbone original thing of Australia. Then on the 10 dollar I had two people from the field of art, one an architect and one a writer. Then on the 20 I got into the more inventive things and the more courageous things. Aviation was a good theme so I used Smithy and Hargrave, Smithy being the great explorer, aviator, and Hargrave being a great inventor of aircraft.\\n\\nAlthough bank notes are security documents and the first problem, right in front of your mind always, must be security – how can you make it more difficult for a counterfeiter to copy – it still remains, in a sense, a work of art, or I’d prefer to call it, in fact, a work of design, because I believe that design also can come under the broad heading as art. A really good piece of design is in a sense a work of art.",

The first museum exhibition of Angus's work at Sydney's Museum of Contemporary Art in 1992 surprised viewers with its resolute and conceptually rigorous interrogation of spatial dynamics, and its engagement with the processes of industrial production. In the late 1990s Angus produced a number of sculptural works that represented carefully chosen animals and objects. A life-sized yellow fibreglass rhinoceros, pink rubber giraffe, and painted bronze dodos evoked perceptual complexity and analysed assumptions of scale and form. The very specific nature of the subjects of Angus's sculptures reflected their rich cultural and semiotic capacities. In 1999 he made several sculptures of a basketball and soccer ball where the use of computer-assisted design techniques enabled the artist to apply physical forces theoretically in virtual space. A real basketball was scanned in 3D and reproduced inside the computer; a soccer ball was created mathematically using computer design. These simulations were then subjected to theoretical velocity and force, captured at the moment of impact with the earth after being dropped from the cruising altitude of a 747 jet airliner, and reproduced as sculptures cast in plaster and bronze."

Appleton set herself up in a studio near Circular Quay, producing fabric designs and running a weekly sketch club, and exhibiting works in the Society of Artists' exhibitions. Three years later she travelled, via cargo ship, to London. Strongly interested in modern art, she studied under Mark Gertler and Bernard Meninsky at the avant-garde Westminster School. There she completed what are considered some of Australia's first cubist paintings, _Still Life_ and _Painting IX_ (both 1937). In London, she was part of a group of Australian artists, including William Dobell, who worked on a mural and a giant gilded ram for the Wool Secretariat pavilion at the 1938 Empire Exhibition in Glasgow. With the outbreak of the war she returned to Australia, thereafter teaching at Canberra Grammar and then at the Julian Ashton and National Art Schools in Sydney. The first of her thirteen solo exhibitions was held at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries in 1940; over decades, she was close friends with fellow Macquarie artists Grace Cossington Smith and Thea Proctor. She painted many still-life pictures, featuring flowers and fruit arranged on sunlit indoor tables, but from the 1950s onward she also painted abstract works, often inspired by rivers or rocks and influenced by Paul Cézanne. In 1965, Appleton won the inaugural Portia Geach Memorial Award with a self portrait that is now in the National Portrait Gallery's collection. Though her work is now represented in major state and regional collections, Appleton was like many women artists of her generation in that recognition of her work came late in life: she was in her eighties when a public gallery first presented a retrospective exhibition of her art."

I like to work very freely and spontaneously in colour. And I feel if one has too much of a preconceived idea, one tends to lose the freshness and get a rather forced and striving feeling about it, as if you were trying to copy something that you already had seen in your mind.\\n\\nI’ve found myself becoming increasingly interested in still life subjects. I feel I like to abstract them a good deal but I’m interested in shapes and objects in space, and their relationship to each other, and I look for the abstract qualities in these things rather than making any effort to reproduce them.\\n\\nI’m interested in order; I don’t like things to be chaotic, and I like to feel that there is an ordered relation between the parts of a painting. Colour, of course, is an absolute joy, and I love warm colours; reds, yellows and warm violets, although I get a great deal of pleasure out of blues, too – I think it’s perhaps unwise to say that you have any favourite colours.\\n\\nI like to work on a fairly large scale and I like to be able to start a painting and go on and work and work at it without being interrupted. I think that’s one of the most difficult things in this modern life we lead, being able to get away from interruptions.\\n\\nBut I do think it’s awfully difficult to say just what your aim is in painting a picture. I feel that the picture says it for you much better than you can say it yourself. And I feel that any good thing in a painting is usually something that you can’t talk about.",

                    "content": "Maurice Ashkanasy (1901-1971) was a barrister and Jewish community leader whose family came to Australia from London when he was 9 years old. He studied law at the University of Melbourne (LL.B., 1923; LL.M., 1924) and was awarded the Hastie exhibition (1919) for psychology, logic and ethics. After being admitted to the Bar in 1924, he read with (Sir) Robert Menzies, and took silk in 1940. He served with distinction in World War II, being part of an adventurous escape from Singapore in a small boat, which eventually reached Fremantle. He was an assistant adjutant-general, in Malaya and New Guinea, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was mentioned in dispatches. Returning to the Bar and appearing in a wide range of causes and jurisdictions, he quickly established a reputation as a leader, a powerful advocate and a skilful strategist. Elected as vice-chairman of the Victorian Bar Council in 1952, and chairman from 1953-56, he did much to improve the conditions and organisation of the Bar, including guiding the proposal for the construction of the Owen Dixon Chambers. He was vice president of the Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists. An active member of the Labor Party, he stood unsuccessfully for the seat of Balaclava (1946) and for the Senate in 1958. Throughout his life he was deeply involved in Jewish community affairs, interests and causes. He was an advocate of the establishment of the State of Israel. In Australia he promoted improved organisational structures for state and national Jewish groups, to ensure effective representation to government and the nation. From the 1920s he had taken a leading part in the foundation of the Judean League, an umbrella organisation for Jewish youth, sporting and cultural groups. Largely under his leadership and guidance, this saw the formation in 1947 of the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies. He was a strong backer of the Jewish day school, Mount Scopus College. Ashkanasy was five times president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. He was awarded a CMG in 1961."

Born in St Kilda, Barnett worked for Stewart and Co and briefly operated his own studio in Hobart before setting up Falk Studios in Sydney in 1885. Falk Studios became the leader in portraits of contemporary Australian stars of the stage and captured many celebrity visitors including Sarah Bernhardt, Robert Louis Stevenson and Mark Twain. In the 1890s Barnett established a highly successful photographic studio in London, working for celebrities, artists, royalty and high society personalities. Barnett's close social relationship with fellow expatriate artists Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts, Charles Conder and, significantly, the French sculptor Auguste Rodin provided the impetus for much of his photography and were crucial to the success of his studio. His works were widely admired for their beauty and artistic strength. The National Portrait Gallery mounted _Legends: The Art of Walter Barnett 1862-1934_ in 2001."

Having trained in engraving in Venice, he worked briefly in Rome before moving to London in 1764. Four years later he became a founding member of the Royal Academy. Bartolozzi's great technological breakthrough was the invention of a stipple technique for coloured engravings. In 1802 he was invited to become Director of the National Academy in Lisbon. He died in Portugal."

She is one of Australia's most celebrated contemporary artists, famous for her figurative paintings that feature fantastical characters posed against ornate—and sometimes psychedelic—backgrounds. Many of Barton's intricate paintings are focused on women, often surrounded by an abundance of flowers, fruit and other symbols of femininity, fertility and motherhood. On the occasion of the opening of a major retrospective of her work at the National Gallery of Victoria in 2018, Barton said: 'My greater oeuvre always speaks to different ways of inhabiting a female body in all of its complexities.'\\n\\nBarton has been a finalist in the Archibald Prize five times and won it twice: first in 2008 for a self-portrait with her children, then in 2013 for her painting of the actor Hugo Weaving, which is one of her few male portraits. Although Barton is best known for her paintings, she also works with collage, sculpture, textiles and video. In 2022, Barton released her first feature film, _Blaze_, which she co-wrote and directed."

She grew up in the Western suburbs of Sydney, where her parents instilled in her a passion for food. In 1970, she married Colin Beer and, three years later, the couple moved to the Barossa Valley in South Australia, which remains their home today. There, they started a farm and, in 1979, opened the Pheasant Farm Restaurant, offering simple meals made from scratch using only seasonal ingredients they grew themselves. This back-to-basics philosophy earned the restaurant a devoted following and critical acclaim—it won the Remy Martin Cognac/Australian Gourmet Traveller Restaurant of the Year Award in 1991—while quietly revolutionising the Australian food industry, encouraging a greater focus on local produce and rustic, regional cuisine.\\n\\nAfter Beer closed Pheasant Farm Restaurant in 1993, she launched her own brand, Maggie Beer, which produces pâté, jams, wines, vinegars, verjuice and dozens of other products that are sold in Australia and around the world. Beer has also written several cookbooks and become a television presenter, appearing on programmes such as _The Cook and the Chef_, _The Great Australian Bake Off_ and _MasterChef Australia_. In 2010, she received the Senior Australian of the Year award for her work educating Australians about what they eat. Four years later, she created the Maggie Beer Foundation to enrich the lives of older Australians, especially those in aged care homes, through food."

As a photographer he has been a finalist in the Olive Cotton Prize (four times), the National Photographic Portrait Prize of 2014 and the Muswellbrook Photographic Prize, in which, in 2003, he took out both first and second prize. In the field of drawing, he has been a finalist in the Adelaide Perry Drawing Prize and won the Reg Russom Life Drawing Prize in 1994. Of his portraits, Beletich says, 'As a photographic artist, the main thread of my interest has always been portraiture. The challenge to convey a person, simply and honestly, is a pursuit that keeps me returning to this tradition.'"

Born in Rockhampton, she started learning ballet at age three and was sixteen when she was accepted into the Royal Ballet School. She joined the Royal Ballet as a First Soloist in 1992 having performed with the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet (where she was Principal Dancer from 1987), the London Festival Ballet (where she was again promoted to Principal Dancer), and the Deutsche Oper Ballet, where she worked with choreographer and former artistic director of the Royal Ballet, Sir Kenneth MacMillan. It was at his urging that Benjamin joined the Royal Ballet, making her debut there in 1992 as Mary Vetsera in MacMillan's _Mayerling_, a role she reprised for her final performance with the company in 2013. In the intervening years, she danced leading roles in numerous ballets including some of the most iconic works in the repertoire (_Swan Lake_, _The Nutcracker_, _Coppelia_, _Giselle_, _The Firebird_, _Cinderella _and _Sleeping Beauty_, for example), and created new roles for choreographers such as Alastair Marriott, Wayne McGregor, Alexei Ratmansky, David Bintley and Christopher Wheeldon. One of the last members of the Royal Ballet to work with Macmillan, Ninette de Valois and Frederick Ashton, Benjamin was awarded many accolades during her career including Best Female Dancer at the National Dance Awards (UK) in 2004 and 2009. She was named an OBE in 2005, a Member of the Order of Australia in 2015, and in 2014 she launched the Leanne Benjamin Awards – a scholarship scheme enabling young Australian dancers to train at the Royal Ballet School. In early 2024, Benjamin was appointed Artistic Director of the Queensland Ballet – the first woman to assume the role."

After graduating he went overseas, spending two years working as an editor in Nigeria before returning to London and a role with the British Film Institute. His first feature films _The Adventures of Barry McKenzie_ (1972) and _Barry McKenzie Holds his Own_ (1974) – both collaborations with Barry Humphries – achieved box-office success but were sourly received by critics. Regardless, they signalled Beresford’s emergence as a key figure in Australia's film renaissance, and he then cemented his standing with _Don's Party_ (1976), _The Getting of Wisdom_ (1977), _Breaker Morant_ (1980), _The Club_ (1980) and _Puberty Blues_ (1981). His debut Hollywood feature, _Tender Mercies_ (1983) earned him an Oscar nomination for best director. His 1989 film _Driving Miss Daisy_ won four Academy Awards, including best picture – although Beresford himself was overlooked for nomination in the direction category. Subsequent projects include the films _Black Robe_ (1991); _Last Dance_ (1996); _Paradise Road_ (1997); _Mao’s Last Dancer_ (2009) and _Ladies in Black_ (2018), and the TV miniseries _Bonnie and Clyde_ (2013) and _Roots_ (2016)."

                    "content": "Charles Blackman OBE (1928–2018), artist, studied at East Sydney Technical College and worked as a press artist for the _Sun_ newspaper before moving to Melbourne, where he came to the attention of arts patron John Reed. With Reed's support, he began to produce his signature series of images, incorporating schoolgirls with flowers and _Alice in Wonderland_ figures and motifs. He was a signatory to the _Antipodean Manifesto_ (loosely, a defence of figuration against abstraction) in the early 1950s. After he won the Helena Rubenstein Scholarship in 1960, his work was shown in the important Whitechapel and Tate exhibitions in London in 1961–1962. Exhibiting prolifically throughout his career, over the 1970s he produced softer images of cats and gardens. In the early 1990s, a period during which he revisited themes of his early work, a Blackman retrospective show toured nationally. In 2004, previously unseen drawings from the collection of his erstwhile partner, Barbara Blackman, were exhibited at Eastgate and Holst, Melbourne. Charles Blackman is one very few Australian artists who lived to see one of his paintings sell for more than a million dollars, with the monumental _Alice's Journey_ selling for $1.02 million in 2006. Renowned especially for his drawing, he is represented in the National Gallery of Australia and all state galleries."

But it was not really a sort of disciplined thing, it wasn’t really a thought-out thing. It was a thing where it was chasing a substance, it was kind of style chasing a substance. Once the substance was realised in some sort of sense, then the operative thing was to make it function properly, make it function fully. It’s like, sort of, driving a little baby Austin, finally you become a mature enough driver to be able to run an E-type Jag or a very complex piece of machinery. You have the emotional equipment realised, but it is then to make it a public fact, it is then to make it kind of articulate, a real articulate message in plastic terms, that is, it must be, the feeling must be couched properly in paint, the image must be embedded properly in the paint, must be trapped, as Francis Bacon says very well, in the paint.\\n\\nWell, now I work not so haphazardly, get up very early in the morning, go to the studio, clean up all the brushes, tidy up the room, sweep the floor and start working in a very detached sort of way, and work through disinterest to interest, or work, labour, very long hours on making a painting function within itself in a fairly detached sort of way. But this only could have been done by this kind of organic growth of the personality, it couldn’t have been done in the artificial sense, you can’t outside impose thoughts, they have to grow.",

She became a member of Brisbane's literary circle, joining the writers' group _Barjai_, which included Judith Wright and Thea Astley. In 1950 she was diagnosed with optic atrophy, and was declared blind by the age of 22. 'It seemed to me I was given a life sentence for a crime I had not committed,' she wrote in her 1997 biography _Glass after Glass_. Moving to Sydney to study, she met artist Charles Blackman. After they married in 1952, they moved to Melbourne, where they associated with the avant-garde group centred around the Melbourne Contemporary Art Society: Arthur Boyd, Fred Williams, Joy Hester, John and Sunday Reed, Clifton Pugh, John Perceval, Len French and Mirka Mora among others. In the 1960s the Blackmans were part of the Australian Push active in London. Long-term muse to her husband (they divorced in 1978), she appeared in many of his paintings including his 1956 series _Alice in Wonderland_, and modelled for their artist friends. Blackman also worked as a magazine columnist and a radio-producer for Radio for the Print Handicapped, and helped form the National Federation of Blind Citizens. She interviewed hundreds of people for the National Library of Australia's oral history program. Blackman published _Portrait of a Friendship_, which drew on her correspondence with Judith Wright, in 2007. A documentary about her life, _Seeing from Within_, was released in 2017."

But somehow what his creations came out of – a sort of a living or understanding of poetry – was something that always bound us and still binds us together. But at that time when I recognised Charles as potentially a very great painter and a great creator, I relinquished my strong intentions of being a writer and although I went on writing diaries and sometimes poems and more and more I became a very prolific letter-writer as I gathered more and more interesting people as friends and we became more and more separated by distance, my writing changed course, as in fact my life had changed course to become devoted to Charles’ optimal putting forward of himself as a painter.\\n\\nYou know, when we married I said, ‘Well if you’re going to be a painter, you’re going to paint, you’re not going to go out and get a job doing something or another,’ so he stayed home and painted. And by this time my eyesight had failed almost altogether and I was on a blind pension, so we had that as a basis to live on. And the only thing I could really do was to work as an artist’s model, as a nude model, which in fact I quite enjoyed because I was picking up a lot of information about painting. It’s quite an elegant job in its way, being a model, because one can decide one’s own poses and it’s a very private occupation. One can have one’s own thoughts and one has the satisfaction of knowing one’s doing a job well.",

                    "content": "Neville Bonner (1922–1999) was the first Indigenous Australian elected to federal parliament. Bonner’s mother was a Jagera woman; his father English. Born under a palm tree on Ukerebagh Island at the mouth of the Tweed River in northern New South Wales, he was educated by his grandmother, only attending school for two years in his mid-teens. He worked in labouring jobs including ringbarking, cane cutting, scrub clearing and herding stock before moving to Palm Island, his wife’s traditional home, where he lived for many years. There, he began his involvement in community affairs, joining the One People of Australia League, of which he became Queensland President from 1967 and National President from 1980. He joined the Liberal Party after the successful 1967 Referendum. In 1971, the Liberal Party invited him to fill a Senate vacancy; famously, soon after giving his maiden speech, he demonstrated how to throw a boomerang on the Senate Lawn. He was elected as Senator in four subsequent elections between 1972 and 1980. During his term, Bonner was Senate Deputy Chairman of Committees and served on the Joint Parliamentary Publications Committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, the Regulation and Ordinances Committee and the Joint House Committee. He frequently crossed the floor to vote with the Opposition on Indigenous matters. Along with environmentalist Dr Harry Butler, he was made Australian of the Year in 1979. After he resigned from the Liberal Party in 1983 and retired from politics, he served as a member of the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for eight years, was a patron of World Vision and Amnesty International, and was a member of the Council of Griffith University, from which he obtained an honorary doctorate in 1993. In 1984 he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia."

Since then she has established an international reputation as a leading portrait and reportage photographer. She has also shot movie stills and 'specials' for the films _Dogs in Space_, directed by Richard Lowenstein, and _Ghosts of the Civil Dead_ and _To Have and to Hold_, both directed by her husband John Hillcoat. Her first book, _The Babies_, a photographic study of infantilists (adults who derive sexual pleasure from acting or being treated as babies), was released in December 2000. Joint winner of the 1994 John Kobal Photography Portrait Award, Borland's work has featured in exhibitions in Australia and the United Kingdom including the 1999 Meltdown Festival in London, the British National Portrait Gallery's display _Artists of the 1990s_ and _Glossy: Faces Magazines Now_ at the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra.  _Polly Borland: Australians_, an exhibition which is a collaborative project between the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra, and the National Portrait Gallery, London to celebrate the Centenary of Federation was shown in London and Australia in 2000-2001. Borland says that \"I have a fascination with people - I love meeting them and photographing them. It's a passion. I think of my camera like a microscope, regarding my sitters closely. On a good day it is more like a x-ray machine being able to penetrate below the surface. At its best portrait photography is psychologically revealing.\""

And anyway, I got there, and I think in the back of my mind I thought it’d be great to get her naked, but I thought there’s no way she’s going to do that. And she’s still beautiful, very Amazonian kind of woman. Every time I went somewhere to photograph, I tried to look for the most simple area in the house. Nothing really appealed to me and then I went into her bedroom, and she said ‘Oh well of course you can photograph me in here’ and she said to Jenny my assistant ‘Well of course I’d never be clothed in my bedroom; I’d have my clothes off.’ And so Jenny came through to me and she went ‘She wants to take her clothes off’ and I’m like, wow, I’ve thought I’ve hit the jackpot, this is amazing. It was her idea, not mine, she took her clothes off, she’s happy to do it, totally consensual.\\n\\nThe Sun or one of the tabloid English press got a hold of the picture and published it. And she said ‘Well I want to give it to The Sun for the page three girl section which was the notorious boobs, naked breasts. But at that point we were suing the other tabloid newspaper for using the photo without my permission. So we couldn’t then let The Sun use it even though that would have been really funny. So we said ‘Look, no, we can’t do it.’ And she was the one from wanting us to give it to The Sun or sell it to The Sun or whatever. So I think she got a little bit annoyed that we said no we can’t do that because it’s going to take away from the court case. Anyway, and then the next time I read anything that she said about the photo she’s completely slamming the photo. So like, you know, it’s awful, it’s this, it’s that, you know, she manipulated me. And I just thought, ‘Oh I can’t be bothered with this.’",

In 1910 he won a McConnell scholarship and travelled to London, where he studied at the South London School of Sculpture and the Royal Academy School and served as an assistant to Bertram MacKennal. After serving in the Royal Tank Corps in France from 1914 to 1919, Bowles resumed his studies at the Royal Academy before returning to Australia in 1924. Here, alongside a number of other artists, he was employed by the Australian War Memorial on the production of dioramas depicting aspects of the First World War. From 1925 to 1931 Bowles was head sculptor of the modelling section at the Memorial. His diverse work included several major sculptures, including The man with the donkey; the gargoyles in the commemorative courtyard; and, with Napier Waller, the initial sculptural feature for the Hall of Memory. Bowles was often consulted on the commissioning of sculptures and memorials until his death in 1954."

                    "content": "Arthur Boyd AC OBE (1920–1999), painter, potter and printmaker, was one of Australia’s greatest artists. Born in Murrumbeena, an outer suburb of Melbourne, Boyd’s mother and father, Doris and Merric, were artists, as were his paternal grandparents, Arthur Merric and Emma Minnie Boyd. He began making paintings as a boy and briefly attended night classes at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, developing a vigorous and expressive style. During the Second World War he was conscripted into the Cartographic Unit of the Australian Army. Although he did not see active service, the war inspired paintings depicting a grotesque and unbalanced world. During a trip to Central Australia in the 1950s he was shocked by the living conditions of Aboriginal people in Alice Springs, which resulted in his controversial series Love, Marriage and Death of a Half-caste. In the 1960s, living mainly in England, Boyd embarked on ambitious cycles of paintings based on biblical and mythological themes in Australian bush settings, and designed theatre costumes and sets. Returning to Australia in the early 1970s, he bought a property on the Shoalhaven River on the south coast of New South Wales, Bundanon, where he continued to paint landscapes. Also known for his philanthropy, Boyd made an immense gift of his own work to the National Gallery of Australia in 1975; in 1993 he generously gifted Bundanon to the Australian people."

But, I mean, you don’t ever come out with anything fresh or marvellous, it always seems ghastly when it goes up on the wall, and maybe it is.\\n\\nI hope it’s becoming less taped, or typed. Not meant to be a pun, but anyway, I think that’s what I’d prefer to be happening, that it’s becoming just as much mine, if I can make it that way, but much less typed in the sense that it would be, well, ‘that’s Australian’, or ‘that comes from Melbourne, that comes from Ballarat, that’s where …’. I’d like it to be much more a universal sort of thing. I don’t mean necessarily the painting to look as if it could be done anywhere, but just that it would be much more like good painting rather than like something that comes from somewhere.",

After the war he built midget racing cars for the visiting American driver Johnny Schonberg. When Schonberg retired from the sport Brabham took to driving the cars himself, going on to win Australia's midget-car national title in 1951. He then switched to road racing, moving to England in 1953 in the hope of becoming a Formula One driver. Racing in a Cooper Climax, Brabham won Formula One's World Drivers' Championship in 1959 under dramatic circumstances. In the last lap of the deciding race he was leading the field when his car ran out of fuel. Undaunted, he climbed out and pushed the vehicle over the finish line, thereby securing the finish necessary to take the Championship. He won a second Championship in 1960 and a third in 1966, when he became the first driver in Formula One history to win the title in a car of his own design, the Repco Brabham. Described as an 'untidy, but very effective' driver, Brabham won a career total of 14 Grand Prix events before his retirement in 1970. He was Australian of the Year in 1966, and in 1979 became the first driver in history to be knighted for his services to motor sport. His three sons, Geoff, Gary and David, are all successful professional racing drivers."

His paintings succeeded immediately; his first exhibited work, _Barber’s Shop_, was purchased for the NGV in 1953 as was _Collins Street, 5p.m._ three years later. In 1962 he became Head of the National Gallery Art School. Six years later, finally confident that he could make a living as a full-time artist, he resigned. He painted shopfronts, school yards, gardens and housing estates, nudes, office workers, ballroom dancers, jockeys, brides, drinkers, commissioned portraits and portraits of friends and family. In recent years _The Bar_ 1954 and _The Old Time_ 1969 have set new auction records for the sale of Australian paintings."

What I’m interested in in painting is people, of course, principally, how they live, how they behave, how they get the faces they deserve, how they can bear to put up with a life which seems so curiously tragic.\\n\\nOf course I know that to be interested in people’s behaviour for a painter is most impure. It’s called literary, and in our day nothing could be a greater sin than to be a literary painter; but now I’m old enough to feel that it’s a waste of time to apologise for not painting in some other way, and the fact is that I’m still always fascinated by people and their behaviour. And yet at the same time, it’s not enough to just paint pictures of ideas; at the same time we must put it into a visual form which is as complete as any abstract visual form. And here, there’s always a conflict between the demands of the idea and the demands of the form.\\n\\nAnd in any case, I’m always dubious about the remarks painters make about their own work, because what we so often say is rather what we would like to have done than what we’ve really done.",

                    "content": "Christopher Brennan (1870–1932), poet, was born to Irish parents in Sydney. A brilliant schoolboy, destined early for the priesthood, he gained a scholarship from Cardinal Moran and went to Riverview; there, he abandoned his vocation. As a language and classics student at Sydney University he edited Hermes, fell in love with Victorian poetry, graduated with a First and a University Medal, and lost his religious faith. After a short stint teaching at St Patrick’s, Goulburn, he won a travelling scholarship to the University of Berlin, where he became convinced of the power of poetry to reclaim an ideal version of humanity. Returning to Sydney in 1894, he began cataloguing in the New South Wales Public Library, where he was to rise to second assistant librarian by 1907. Late in 1909 he was appointed an assistant lecturer in French and German at the University of Sydney. His poetic output – complex and symbolic, always more European than Australian in sensibility - for the most part declined after 1902; his biographer Axel Clark suggests that the moderately successful pro-war poems he wrote during the First World War sprang from his hostility toward his German wife and mother-in-law. After he divorced, he embarked on an affair with a younger woman; her accidental death gave rise to some of his finest poems, but his life was thrown into irrecoverable chaos. Gaining odds and ends of teaching, and supported by friends and admirers, he retrieved his Catholic faith before he died. Clark writes that ‘although he abhorred Henry Lawson as a poet and a man, the progress of their lives was hauntingly similar: promise, achievement, degeneration, disgrace, posthumous legend.’"

He then moved to Sydney and from the mid-1990s began increasingly to specialise in portraiture. With clients including film studios and record companies, his carefully composed and thought-provoking photographs have appeared in a range of Australian and international publications including _Vogue_, _Marie Claire_, _Elle_, _Who_, _Rolling Stone_, _Inside Sport_ and _GQ_. In 2005, the National Portrait Gallery presented the exhibition _Peter Brew-Bevan: Portraits_ and he was one of eight photographers included in the Portrait Gallery’s 2014 exhibition _Promo: Portraits from Prime Time_. His photographic book _Shoot: Studio Sessions_ (2007), a selection of his images of actors and other celebrities, won six industry awards for concept and design. In 2019, Brew-Bevan founded the 2020 MEN-Tality Project in partnership with Beyond Blue, which focuses on destigmatising men's mental health through a series of portraits of prominent Australian men with experience of depression and anxiety. The Portrait Gallery's collection includes 21 of his photographs."

In the early 1920s she travelled to southeast Asia, where as 'Miss Bobby' she appeared to good notices as a cabaret and musical comedy performer. In 1926 she established a Performing Arts Academy in Shanghai. She married in England in 1929 and with her husband became co-director and designer for Pellier Ltd, a fashionable Mayfair dress salon. In 1949 she returned to Australia. After ten years of painting and exhibiting, she established a wallpaper business, Australian (Hand Printed) Wallpapers Pty Ltd in St Leonards, Sydney, which later became Florence Broadhurst Wallpapers Pty Ltd in Paddington. Finding the monochromatic, muted tonings that Australians favoured for interiors insufficiently vigorous to 'withstand modern living', she responded with vibrant oversized prints. The Broadhurst Design Collection had grown to some 800 patterns when Broadhurst was murdered in October 1977. The case has never been solved. More than 500 examples of her prints have been revived by Signature Prints, a Sydney business marketing Broadhurst wallpaper, textiles and art, and the designs have been archived by the Powerhouse Museum. Gillian Armstrong's feature film about Broadhurst, Unfolding Florence, and Helen O'Neil's lavishly-designed biography of the designer both appeared in 2006."

                    "content": "Joseph Brown AO OBE (1918–2009), art collector, art dealer and philanthropist, arrived in Australia with his father and siblings from Poland in 1933; his mother had passed away shortly before their departure. The family settled in Carlton. In 1934, he started classes in painting and sculpture with Napier Waller at the Working Men's College (now RMIT) and later won a scholarship to the Brunswick Technical College. The Depression put an end to his studies, and in 1940 he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Force. At the conclusion of his military service, in 1945, he married and established a fashion design business, but continued to paint and sculpt and occasionally exhibit his work. By 1967, he was in a position to open the Joseph Brown Gallery in Collins Street, Melbourne, at which he frequently showed mixed exhibitions of contemporary Australian art. Over time, Brown built up one of the finest private art collections in Australia, and made such substantial contributions to Australian art history that he was awarded three honorary doctorates. His gallery often exhibited the work of overlooked or forgotten artists, and his work had the effect of reinstating colonial art, portraiture and other 'unfashionable' genres to critical and scholarly attention. During the same period, Brown donated in excess of 400 works of art to public collections, including a gift of over 150 works with a total value of $35 million to the National Gallery of Victoria in 2004."

                    "content": "Bob Brown (b. 1944), environmentalist, doctor and former politician, is an environmental campaigner and former Parliamentary Leader of the Australian Greens. Born in Oberon, New South Wales, Brown studied medicine at Sydney University and practiced medicine in Canberra, Darwin, Alice Springs and London. In 1972 he moved to Tasmania, where he worked as a general practitioner in Launceston. His passion for the Tasmanian wilderness was sparked by a rafting trip down the Franklin River in 1976, the same year that he became a founding member of the Wilderness Society. From then until 1983 he famously led the campaign against proposed dam works on the Franklin River, during which he was arrested and gaoled. The river was subsequently preserved with a World Heritage Listing. In 1983, he began a decade in the Tasmanian House of Assembly as the Member for Denison. He was elected to the Federal Senate as a member of the Tasmanian Greens in 1996 and later joined West Australian Greens Senator Dee Margetts in founding the Australian Greens. At the 2001 Federal election Brown was re-elected to the Senate with a greatly increased vote. Brown oversaw the emergence of the Greens from a fringe to a mainstream political force and remains one of the most-recognised Australian political figures, known for his outspokenness on the environment as well as human rights and social justice issues. He has written several books including his memoirs _Memo for a Saner World_ (2004) and _Optimism_ (2014). After stepping down as leader of the Greens and retiring from the Senate in 2012, he established the Bob Brown Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation supporting environmental causes."

As a student under Bernard Hall and WB McInnes at the NGV school from 1918 to 1924, he won many prizes. From this period on, his landscapes and flower pieces sold well, particularly in Victoria and South Australia, and from the time of his first Sydney exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries in 1927 he was commissioned as a portraitist. With a remarkable 72 portraits hung in the Archibald Prize between 1924 and 1966, he won the Prize in 1932 with a portrait of Sir William Irvine. At the end of the second world war he was sent as an official war artist to document the Japanese surrender; he missed the ceremony, but still completed 51 works for the War Memorial. Over the course of his career he made many articulate attacks on modern art."

It’s what’s known as direct painting. I think one of my exhibition managers said: ‘You’re a first-class direct painter, Buckmaster’. And I hardly knew what he meant in those days, but I can see it clearly now. There’s the subject, you put up your canvas, you assess the picture, nature provides you with the inspiration, you, in your mind’s eye, you eliminate the unessentials, you assess and you conceive your picture from what is before you.\\n\\nAnd so, shape, tone and colour: see it, conceive it, think of it, realise it, see your picture in your mind’s eye, then pick up your loaded palette and your brushes and cover the canvas with the masses, the main masses in tone and subtle colour first; the details follow automatically as the pieces fit into a jigsaw puzzle. That has been one angle of my working method on landscape.\\n\\nIt’s quite a totally different technique on portraiture or figure composition. It’s a different thing altogether. It’s too involved to go into now.",

That year she co-curated Australian Women Artists: 1840-1940 at the Ewing and George Paton Gallery; the book that evolved from the exhibition remains a standard Australian art text. In 1975, Burke co-founded the Victorian Women’s Art Movement and LIP, a feminist arts journal. From 1977 to 1982, she lectured in art history at the Victorian College of the Arts; she resigned to write full-time and spent the some years living in Italy and France writing fiction. Second Sight won the 1987 Victorian Premier’s Literary Award. While a trustee of Heide Museum of Modern Art between 1996 and 2005, she wrote books and curated exhibitions about the Heide modernist circle including Dear Sun (2001), Joy Hester.(2001) and Australian Gothic: A life of Albert Tucker (2003). Recently, she curated Sigmund Freud's Art Collection: An Archaeology of the Mind for Monash University Museum of Art and Nicholson Museum, University of Sydney. In Source: Nature's Healing Role in Art and Writing she examined the transformative effects of nature on Picasso, Virginia Woolf and Monet, among others. Personal View: Photographs 1978-1986, a book of her photographs of the Melbourne artworld, was published by Monash University Publishing in May 2011, coinciding with an exhibition of the photographs at the VCA Margaret Lawrence Gallery. Her most recent publications are The Heart Garden (2012), a fourth book about Heide; and Nest: The art of birds (2012)."

                    "content": "Betty Burstall AM (1926–2013) played a vital role in the development of theatre in Australia. Born in Queensland and raised in Melbourne, she commenced an Arts degree at the University of Melbourne in the 1940s, but was expelled on becoming pregnant to her boyfriend, Tim Burstall, later to become an influential filmmaker. They married in 1946 and shortly afterwards moved to Eltham, north-east of Melbourne where Betty worked at the local high school as a French and English teacher. In 1967, she founded La Mama in Carlton, an independent theatre modeled on the original off-Broadway theatre in New York, where she lived in the mid-1960s. Local actors, writers, directors, poets and musicians were encouraged to use the space for innovative, small-scale productions, thus providing an outlet for groundbreaking Australian theatre and fostering writers like David Williamson, Jack Hibberd and Tes Lyssiotis. Current artistic director Liz Jones took over in the 1970s and La Mama still exists today. Following Burstall's death aged eighty-seven in June 2013, a group of Australian writers donated funds toward the establishment of the Betty Burstall Commission, which was awarded to emerging playwright Michele Lee."

                    "transcript": "I first of all found a place, a building which had been an old shirt factory in a part of Melbourne called Carlton. And then I talked to a number of actors and directors and writers to see whether they’d be interested or not and they seemed to be interested but it became clear pretty quickly that the writers were the ones who were really interested because they despaired of ever being able to have their stuff done. The actors did have some sort of commercial work and were much less disillusioned. Directors were pretty interested because there’s very little opportunity for local people to direct their own plays. So, I found writers and I found directors and at first it was difficult finding actors disillusioned enough to come and perform virtually for nothing, because that’s how it works.\\n\\nI’ve had some problems because it somehow seems that most plays that are done are obscene in some way or they would be by conventional standards or perhaps could be considered offensive in some way. It’s surprising actually, when I consider the sort of thing that is done, how few times it has happened but we have had on one particularly spectacular occasion Vice Squad visits and interference. This was when, outside La Mama and in the open, a play that was written by John Romeril, specifically an anti-censorship play, was being staged, actually satirising the vice squad. And the Vice Squad arrived, attempted to arrest the members of the cast and were followed to the police station by a sort of chanting audience. And charges were brought and in the end, I think, people were put on bonds and nothing very terrible happened to them, but it was rather unpleasant. I had to go to the vice squad people where I was interviewed in not the most pleasant way. And sort of warned to be very careful about what was done.\\n\\nI get great kicks out of La Mama and one thing that seems rather nice about it is that it’s exactly the same as it’s been from the very beginning. Now, six years later, it’s as sordid, as small, as uncommercial and as wide open as it was.",

After some years’ travel, exhibiting and working independently, she completed her degree through Adelaide Centre for the Arts in 2006. Since then, in a number of portraits of both notable Australian public figures and ‘unknown’ subjects, she has sought to explore the dichotomy of the public and private self. Her work has featured in solo and group exhibitions in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney, and has been selected for exhibition in the Doug Moran Portrait Prize, the Portia Geach Memorial Award, the Sulman Prize, the Waterhouse National Science Art Prize, the Archibald Prize, the Sunshine Coast Art Prize, the Albany Art Prize, the Arthur Guy Memorial Painting Prize and the Geelong Contemporary Art Prize. In 2014 she became the first artist chosen to undertake a Guildhouse Collections Project at the Art Gallery of South Australia, producing a quiet series of paintings of people engaging with artworks in the Gallery. She won the Kennedy Arts Foundation Award for her work _The Ineffable_ in 2016. But-Husaim’s work is held in public and private collections throughout Australia."

The following year she was diagnosed with Friedreich's Ataxia, a rare and terminal degenerative disease of the nervous system for which there is no cure. She began using a wheelchair in 1996 when she was 26. In 1997 she was nominated as NSW Young Australian of the Year for her work in establishing the Theresa Byrnes Foundation to raise money for research into the disease. After publishing her autobiography, The Divine Mistake, in 1999, she moved to New York the following year, where she has lived ever since. Byrnes regularly exhibits her paintings in New York, Washington, London and Sydney, and received the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Artist Grant for her painting in 2003 and 2006. Best known for her provocative performance works, she uses her whole body to create edgy artworks using materials such as diesel, ink and mud. In 2010 she opened her New York studio gallery, Suffer (later TBG), where she held openings, performances and film screenings. Due to Covid-19 Byrnes was forced to close TBG at the end of 2020. She then completed a residency at Grace Exhibition Space, a New York gallery dedicated to performance art, where she performed _Rock, Alone. Together and Glimpse_."

Moving to Sydney, he studied from 1973 to 1977 at the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education. Over the following years, he lived and painted in the loft of a building on the corner of Pitt and Market streets in Sydney (now a McDonalds franchise). His sister, Elizabeth Campbell, recalls that painting and playing his flute were all he wanted to do, although he worked as a cleaner, a tennis coach, a professional surfer, an assistant in an aged care facility and a waiter at Tattersalls. He only ever painted three portraits. With his first, of poet and performer Adrian Rawlins, he became the youngest artist ever to have a work hung in the Archibald Prize (1977); his portrait of journalist Caroline Jones was a finalist in 1979, and artist Fay Bottrell in 1981. Orange Civic Theatre Gallery director Jane Raffin organised a one-man show of his work in the late 1970s, and in August 1979, on the initiative of Collin Clarke, Myer's chief display artist, 22 Myer windows fronting two Sydney streets were filled with mannequins posed among Campbell's watercolour paintings. In 1984, while living and painting in the Southern Highlands of NSW, Campbell was killed as he rode his motorbike back to Sydney to work."

Although in the 1950s the Indigenous people of the region were actively discouraged from pursuing any of their traditions, Campbell's father was a boomerang maker and Campbell observed him at his craft, shaping wood and inscribing designs. Educated at the Burnt Bridge Mission School, from the age of fourteen Campbell worked in a series of menial jobs in Kempsey and Sydney. When he returned to his birthplace, he started to paint in earnest, depicting, as he said, his personal response to his environment, 'both past and present, the people, the landscape, and my own relationship with both . . . Aboriginal culture naturally becomes a part of my work as a reflection of my heritage and ancestry, but my message is to all people.' In the 1980s, shows in Sydney and Melbourne at the Roslyn Oxley and Christine Abrahams galleries brought him critical recognition. In 1987 he was the artist in residence at the Tin Sheds at the University of Sydney and he was commissioned to create a poster for the Bicentennial Authority. In the late 1980s he travelled to Ramingining in the Northern Territory; he found the experience of the traditional community totally new, and to a certain extent the visit influenced his subsequent work. His portraits _My Brother Mac Silva_ 1989 and _Sammy Alfie Drew: Local Macleay Aboriginal Sporting Identity_ 1990 were hung in the Archibald; in 1990 he had a solo show at the Rebecca Hossack Gallery in London. Campbell's picture _The Provider of the Tucker_ 1987 was hung in the National Portrait Gallery exhibition _A Face in the Crowd_ in 1997; his _Aboriginal Embassy_ 1986 was shown in _Open Air: Portraits and Landscapes_ in 2008."

                    "content": "Pat Cash (b. 1965), professional tennis player, emerged as a potential top-ten player as a teenager, when he won the junior doubles at the French Open, the junior singles and doubles titles at Wimbledon, and the US Open junior singles – all within a few months of each other in 1982. Later that year he joined the ATP men's tour, and in 1983, in helping Australia defeat Sweden for the 1983 Davis Cup, he became the youngest ever player to contest a Davis Cup Final. In 1984 he reached the men’s singles semi-finals at Wimbledon and at the US Open, and finished the year inside the top ten on the ATP world rankings. At the peak of his career he was ranked number 4 in the world. After another Davis Cup triumph over Sweden in 1986, he was runner-up to Stefan Edberg in the singles final at the Australian Open in 1987. He went one better when he defeated World No. 1 Ivan Lendl in straight sets for the Wimbledon singles crown several months later. Cash famously scaled the stands to embrace the occupants of his supporters' box, initiating what has become something of a standard Wimbledon victory celebration. Runner-up for the men's singles at the Australian Open in 1988, Cash's career was somewhat curtailed the following year when he suffered the first in a series of injuries which ultimately led to his withdrawal from the ATP tour in 1997. In retirement he has worked as a broadcaster and commentator for CNN and the BBC and has become something of a drawcard on the legends circuit, winning four consecutive Wimbledon doubles titles with compatriot Mark Woodforde between 2010 and 2013. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2005."

                    "content": "Judy Cassab AO CBE (1920–2015) was one of Australia's best-loved, most successful and prolific portrait painters. Born in Vienna, she studied art in Prague and at the Budapest Academy before adopting false papers and 'going underground' to escape the persecution of Hungarian Jews. After the war, she and her husband reunited and emigrated to Australia in 1951. Within months of arriving in Sydney, she was commissioned by Sir Charles Lloyd Jones to paint a portrait of his wife, becoming an Archibald finalist for the first time the following year. In 1953, she held her first Australian solo exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The winner of the _Australian Women's Weekly_ Portrait Prize in 1955 and 1956, by the mid-1960s she was sought-after as a portraitist, completing commissions for high-profile clients such as Princess Alexandra and Queen Sirikit of Thailand. In 1960, she won the Archibald Prize for her portrait of her friend, Stanislaus Rapotec; in 1967, she won it again with her painting of artist Margo Lewers. In all, Cassab had 41 paintings exhibited in the Archibald Prize. \\n\\nThrough her many other portraits – both formal commissions and portrayals of family and friends – she created a distinct record of Australian society from the 1950s onwards. Cassab also found inspiration for a more abstract style of painting in the landscape of the Northern Territory, to which she repeatedly returned, and won several awards for her landscape works in the Wynne Prize. Her many awards include an honorary doctorate from the University of Sydney and the 1996 Nita B Kibble Literary Award for her published diaries."

Then, as I developed in my other paintings, the portrait developed with it. I still think that every portrait I do is a failure because it didn’t reach what I wanted to do with it. I think I’m best known as a portrait painter because these are the things that get most publicity, but I never wanted to be a portrait painter and I don’t consider myself one.\\n\\nLately, I tried to combine abstract with the portrait but I don’t think it’s a good marriage. I think the best I can do is to paint my abstract pictures and develop them and develop myself, and let the portraits flow freely, because I don’t believe that something which was art all through the centuries stops being art just because it lost its credit by the photographic portraits, the anonymous portraits, from which we have 300 in each country in the world; and although I know that it is a clash, I think, between my other paintings and the portraits, I can’t give up. It’s something that interests me, and that I might solve or might not. Anyway, it doesn’t matter if I solve it when I’m 70.",

In 1904, he moved to Sydney; five years later he held his first solo photographic exhibition, which was also the first solo photographic exhibition in Australia. He was the leading photographer for the Home magazine from the early 1920s onward, and his photographs of Sydney over a number of decades have become key images of aspects of Australian history. The National Library of Australia has some two hundred Cazneaux photographs and the National Gallery of Australia has about twice that number."

After arriving in Australia in 1980 she worked as a translator of Chinese language films (she speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Fukien). Having worked with ABC radio in Darwin and Newcastle, she became a newsreader with the multicultural and multilingual public broadcast channel, SBS, in 1988, gaining devoted viewers through her stern, even contemptuous delivery and superbly-cut tops and jackets. As host of the network's _Fashionista_ program she built a reputation as a style authority, in 2008 curating the National Archives of Australia exhibition of historical fashion photographs, _Strike a Pose … With Lee Lin Chin_. Known also as a comedian and a voice for social change, she has a huge social media following although she posts little, if anything, herself, retaining an intriguing air of mystery. Her 'Chinspirational' book, _Iced Beer and Other Tantalising Tips for Life_, co-written with Chris Leben, was published in 2016. Among the causes Chin supports is The Social Studio, an enterprise dedicated to creating employment and educational pathways for young people who have been refugees."

Returning to Australia in 1931, she established a studio in Melbourne, producing pieces based on the simple lines of ancient Mediterranean art, and gained a reputation as a potent modern artist. Between 1938 and 1941 she made two huge figures for the Royal Hobart Hospital, a memorial fountain in Bendigo, panels for the Mutual Life and Citizen's Building, Sydney, and the massive figure for the Pioneer Women's Memorial in Adelaide. She then turned to teaching, while continuing to produce sculptures for churches. Late in her career she made the fairies' tree for Melbourne's Fitzroy Gardens. Cohn's work is represented in most major Australian galleries."

                    "content": "Grace Cossington Smith OBE (1892–1984) was a pioneer of modernist art in Australia. Born in Sydney, Cossington Smith began her training in art in 1910 with the Italian-born teacher, Antonio Dattilo Rubbo, who she later described as 'the only one in Sydney at that time who knew anything about the modern masters'. Her parents, Ernest and Grace Smith, supported her pursuit of art, enabling her to spend two years studying in England, where she was inspired by post-impressionism. She returned to Rubbo's classes in Sydney in 1914 and the following year her painting _The Sock Knitter_, considered the first post-impressionist work painted in Australia, was included in the Royal Art Society exhibition. Around 1920, she adopted the surname Cossington Smith, 'Cossington' being the name of the family home in Turramurra where Grace lived and worked for almost 65 years. Despite the hostility of the conservative Sydney art establishment, Cossington Smith became one of a group of artists who stayed resolute in their exploration of modernism. In the late 1920s, she began exhibiting with the Contemporary Group (established in 1926 by George Lambert and Thea Proctor) and held the first of many solo exhibitions; in the same period she commenced work on her exhilarating and now celebrated series of paintings of the Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction. Following the deaths of her parents in the 1930s, Cossington Smith moved from her garden studio to one attached to the main house and during the 1940s began to focus on intimate paintings of interiors, in which she expressed forms with colour and light. Her contribution to Australian art went largely unrecognised until, at age 81, she was honoured with a retrospective exhibition, which opened at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1973 and toured to state galleries. She was awarded an OBE the same year. She eventually left Cossington and moved to a nursing home, where she died at the age of 92 in December 1984. Her works have since become among those most recognised in the collections of major galleries and in the canon of modern art in Australia."

I used to be very fond of the bush but now I can’t manage to go out in the bush.\\n\\nThe large painting which I have in the Wills art prize competition is an interior. It’s a room with a wardrobe and a bed and a carpet but the chief thing to me was the yellow walls, so that is why I call it _Interior in Yellow_. It was a very exciting thing to do. I wanted to express the forms in colour with the light because the whole thing is meant to express an interior with the light.\\n\\nI use squares in the way I paint, not from a conscious way but it came to me naturally because I feel in that way that light can be put into the colour. whereas just to put colour on to the surface in a flat way, I feel that it gives it a dead look.\\n\\nThe room is in my own home here and the sunlight did not come in in a definite way but the whole room seemed to be full of light, which is what I want to do more than the actual sunlight. I feel that even the shadows are a subdued light and they must have light in them as well as the light parts.",

In Melbourne, throughout the 1950s and 1960s he exhibited pictures of miners, construction workers, demonstrations and other scenes of working-class life. Between 1951 and 1960 his work was shown in London, Warsaw, Copenhagen, Moscow and Leningrad; during this period he won the Crouch Prize twice, the McCaughey Prize and the VS drawing prize as well as a bronze medal at the International Graphics exhibition in Leipzig. In 1969 he exhibited in Poland and the USSR. The NGV held a survey of his work in 1973, in which year he also had a survey show at the Commonwealth Gallery in London; in 1974 he had a residency at the Cité in Paris. In 1982 he lived in France, and produced a body of work depicting French village life."

I feel that my work is in, at least in their tradition, in contemporary terms and whatever I can do to add a picture of our times to our art, well then, I will do it.\\n\\nI think every artist has something of the philosopher in him; he is concerned to some extent with the meaning of what he sees.\\n\\nIn my own case, I have been and still am intensely interested in human relations, in people’s attitudes and behaviour to each other, not just on a personal level but on the bigger, social level.",

Having worked for two years on Thursday Island for the Diocese of Carpentaria, he began painting scenes of island life. Comparisons with Gauguin are inevitable, though Crooke often painted people in dim interiors against a window giving onto bright light. A long-time resident of Cairns, he travelled extensively in northern Australia and painted some remarkably evocative landscapes, such as _Chillagoe_ 1962, _Landscape with rocks in foreground_ 1967 and _Ant Hill Country, Laura_ 1969, all in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. In 1966 he served as an official war artist in Vietnam. He won the Archibald Prize in 1969 for a portrait of a close friend, the writer George Johnson. In the mid-1990s he donated his collection of works by Drysdale, Friend, Olley and Boyd to Perc Tucker Regional Gallery, Townsville, which mounted _North of Capricorn_, a major retrospective of his work that toured in 1998-1999. Crooke is represented in all major Australian galleries and his work remains popular amongst collectors."

That is why I think that I found the pattern in the islands, the simple island people living in some sort of crude harmony with nature, so exciting and fascinating. This relationship is deeper than just a decorative pattern of people walking in tropical foliage, it’s something which I have always felt myself. I’ve always been interested in the study of nature, from the smallest facets of insects up to birds and animals and plants, not in a scientific way but in a practical way, in a sense of wonderment; the beauty and the sort of mystery about them is very important to me. In fact, this feeling of wonder, to be able to sort of see these things with some sort of fresh vision, is the thing that I find most important to keep.\\n\\nThe relationship of the man to his environment is quite a problem pictorially because although I want to paint man in relation to nature, I also want to paint good paintings, that is, paintings that have the values of paint and colour and shape and so on. So all the facets of a good painting – design, texture, and all the values and so on – I try and I hope that I can weld them into this one simple expression of man in some form of dignified harmony with the natural world around him.",

He moved at the age of four to Australia, where his parents worked as caterers on TV and movie sets. His big-screen debut came in The Crossing (1990), in which he co-starred with his future and former wife Danielle Spencer. He won AFI awards for his work in Proof (1991) and Romper Stomper (1992), and played Jack Thompson’s gay son in The Sum of Us (1994). The following year he moved to Hollywood to make The Quick and the Dead (1995); soon after, he drew rave reviews as the brooding Bud White in L.A. Confidential (1997). The Insider (1999), Gladiator (2000), and A Beautiful Mind (2001) earned him three consecutive Best Actor Oscar nominations: he won for Gladiator (and took out the Golden Globe for A Beautiful Mind). Following Master and Commander, Crowe dominated a series of tough action dramas, including Cinderella Man (2004), 3:10 to Yuma (2007), American Gangster (2007) and Body of Lies (2008). He returned to costume for Robin Hood (2010) and Les Misérables (2012); he starred in the Biblical epic Noah (2014) before the release of his directorial debut, The Water Diviner (2014). In 2016 he starred rather surprisingly in a well-reviewed comedy, The Nice Guys, with Ryan Gosling. From 2006 to 2013 Crowe was a part-owner of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Crowe commutes regularly between the USA, the north coast of NSW and Sydney."

After suffering many insults as the daughter of a single mother, as a teenager she was noticed on a Tamworth street by a photographer, who encouraged her to move to Sydney and try her luck at modelling. She described herself as 'looking like a milkmaid' at the time she scored her first assignments for major department stores, but she was named Model of the Year in 1949. Catwalk shows for David Jones followed, along with contracts for magazines including the _Australian Women's Weekly_ and _Woman's Day_. At the age of 22, in 1950, she established the June Dally-Watkins School, which has since trained countless students in deportment and etiquette in Sydney and Brisbane. The following year she established Australia's first modelling agency and, later, a business college. Famously romanced by actor Gregory Peck during a visit to Rome in the 1950s, she returned to Australia to continue her career, marry and raise four children. In 1969 she published _The June Dally-Watkins Book of Manners for Moderns_. Dally-Watkins took her etiquette lessons to students in China in 2013, co-founding the Dally Institute in Guangzhou. Her autobiography _The Secrets Behind My Smile_ was published in 2002. Dally-Watkins died at the age of 92, leaving a lasting legacy not only on the Australian modelling industry, but on the thousands of students to whom she imparted impeccable manners and a knowledge of etiquette."

Let’s say that I am painting a portrait. Well, I don’t look at my subject as a person as we think of a person in normal circumstances; I think of my subject in terms of the medium in which I can express myself, that is, paints on a canvas, and I have to think of the limitations of this means of expression.\\n\\nI have only a certain number of coloured pigments which I can apply to a flat surface. And on a very sort of superficial analysis it can be seen at once that all that a painter has at his disposal to express his thoughts are colours which are light or dark in varying degrees, colours which are warm or cool, and certain shapes disposed in certain proportions. As we often say, we can only express ourselves by means of tone, proportion and colour, tone being the intensity of the pigment, proportion being the disposition of various shapes and colour, of course, is simply this matter of warmth or coolness. There is actually nothing else that we have to use. We’ve got no soul, no expression, no – we haven’t even got a three dimension. We have to give the illusion of a three dimension by the way in which we relate our three elements: tone, proportion and colour.\\n\\nWhen it comes to expressing a mood, well, we haven’t any mood paint on our canvas, we have to arrange again our colours, our elements, in such a way that we can convey to the spectator some feeling which we have had.",

Inaugural Chairman of the Board of the Australian National Gallery from 1982 to 1986, in 1987, reflecting his interest in the visual arts, he founded the Gordon Darling Australian Print Fund, which has acquired over 6 000 prints for the national collection. In 1991 he established the Gordon Darling Foundation, which continues to provide funding and staff development opportunities for public art institutions Australia-wide. That year, too, he and Marilyn Darling initiated the Darling Foundation-sponsored touring exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery, the interest generated by which led to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery, housed first in the National Library of Australia, then in Old Parliament House and then in its own building on King Edward Terrace, Parkes."

Born in Sydney, she spent the first six years of her life in the rural New South Wales town of Forbes. Dawson's mother, who had studied art with Will Ashton, recognised her daughter's talent early and was advised by Ashton to encourage it. She had her first formal lessons following her family's relocation to Melbourne in the early 1940s, attending the private art school run by artist and illustrator Harold Septimus Power. In 1951, aged sixteen, she enrolled at the National Gallery School and attended night classes with Sir William Dargie. Five years later, Dawson won a National Gallery of Victoria Travelling Scholarship and went to London, where she enrolled at the Slade School and the Central School to study painting, etching and lithography. She travelled in Italy and worked as a proof printer in Paris before returning to Melbourne in 1961. She held her first solo exhibition the same year and in 1963 set up an art school and workshop, where she printed the work of artists such as Albert Tucker, Charles Blackman and Russell Drysdale. Dawson was one of only three women included in the renowned exhibition of Australian abstraction, _The Field_, at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1968. After several years in Sydney, Dawson moved to live in the bush near Binalong, NSW, in 1973. That year, she won the Archibald Prize with a portrait of her husband, the late writer, actor and playwright Michael Boddy. In 1978, she and Boddy founded The Bugle Press, producing fine art books and prints. Her work is represented in all major public collections in Australia, and has been the subject of exhibitions at the National Gallery of Victoria (1979), the National Gallery of Australia (1996) and a 2006 touring exhibition, _Janet Dawson Survey_."

Now I find that although I must work directly, I usually work on about three or four paintings and a series of drawings before anything final comes out of this. A final, or a finalised painting, quite often happens fairly quickly. With my particular method it must be very fresh. I find that very clean, very fresh colour is essential. I find tremendous sensual delight in clarity and finality of area, so consequently a painting can’t possibly have any labour on its actual surface, the labour must go on in other places. And I find that the more I work, the more prolonged are these periods of making studies and drawings.\\n\\nI find that I’m continually going back to the figure as being something that contains so much, so many possibilities. Through exploration, probably like all good sensualists, I keep finding the figure in landscape and the landscape in the figure; areas of flesh stretched across muscle or relaxed, tightened up, loose flesh, delicate little veins, bony areas, are things that I feel with tremendous ecstasy that I’ve never yet been able to put down in any way, something that I’m trying very hard to do at the moment.",

His unabashed performance in the potent drama was critically acclaimed and earned him an AFI Award nomination. He went on to appear in many films and plays, and starred in the television series _Blue Murder_ (1995), _Wildside_ (1997–1999), _Underbelly_ (2008) and _The Slap_ (2011), for which he won the AACTA for Best Lead Actor in a television series.

On his return to Sydney after a decade he managed to impress conservative and modernist art factions alike. In the Second World War, Dobell served in a camouflage unit and the Civil Construction Corps of the Allied Works Council. Out of this experience, in 1943, came two portraits: one of Joe Westcott, a loudmouthed, indolent wharfie, titled _The Billy Boy_; and another of fellow artist and camoufleur, Joshua Smith. Both paintings were hung in the Archibald Prize exhibition that year, and the portrait of Smith was announced the winner. The decision was challenged, however, by a faction of conservative artists who claimed that Dobell's painting of his friend was a caricature, not a portrait, and who took the matter to court. Meanwhile, the National Art Gallery (as the AGNSW was then known) extended the exhibition dates and by March 1944 the painting had reportedly been viewed by over 140,000 people. The court eventually found in Dobell's favour – his lawyers having persuasively argued that likeness and photographic accuracy weren't necessarily one and the same thing. Dobell was affected physically and emotionally by the controversy and gave up painting for some time.\\n\\nSlowly, the artist rebuilt his career; he won both the Wynne Prize for landscape and the Archibald Prize for the second time, with a portrait of Margaret Olley, in 1948. He won another Archibald in 1959, and _Time_ magazine commissioned his portrait of Robert Menzies for its cover in 1960. These and other successes of Dobell's, including his knighthood, conferred in 1966, did much to increase the status of artists in Australia."

And there I made my studies. They consisted of small watercolour paintings, and I think altogether I had about 40 minutes with the Prime Minister for this purpose.\\n\\nI always paint, as I think, a straight portrait and I go for the character of the person and, in this case, I think there was very strong character and I’d be very foolish to play around and do silly things with an international figure of that type. And I think I got a fairly good job done in the time allowed me.\\n\\nOh well, we’ll see the results when they come out.\\n\\nUsually I like to get to know a person well before I do a portrait, sometimes at least a week, or have a few drinks with them or dine with them, to get them relaxed and to pick out their salient mannerisms. In the case of Mr Menzies, I have only met him once or twice over a period of about 15 years, socially, so I really didn’t know him, which made the job more difficult. And in this particular case, in the surrounds of Parliament House and offices, there is a tenseness, and relaxing was really a frightening business. I couldn’t really relax, and I had to take my studies away, then try to get everything from that build-up, with what I remembered of him. As I say, I didn’t really know the man well.",

Although that was mechanical drawing, in a way it satisfied me for the time being.\\n\\nThen I was able to come to Sydney later on, and I gave away architecture and started to study art at an art school.\\n\\nAs you go through studying, you get more and more keen, and then – well, you just get into it. I went away to England on scholarships and studied abroad and saw the best works all around the world. It really becomes a mania, eventually, in art.\\n\\nI have often been asked what it is that makes me want to paint certain people. Well, I think, first of all, it’s the interesting form, the sculptural form of the person and the strong characters of a person, the strong individuality. And I strive for that. I don’t know whether other artists do it or not, but personally I like to fit them to my style. I see them as my style of painting and try to bring that style first. It’s a sculptural technique, more like sculpture than painting. And if I see those things in a person, well, I strive for it like a piece of sculpture. I particularly like the Gothic type of sculpture, and I try to get that into my better works.",

Soon, his stylised, colourful representations of Sydney's beaches, harbour, animals and flowers found their way onto placemats, t-shirts, bibs, swimwear, sheets, mugs and vases. In 1987, when Ellis took this photograph for Playboy, Done had an annual turnover of more than $4 million. Ellis spent time with him at his studio on the water at Chinaman's Beach in Middle Harbour, finding him to have 'a strong sense of himself as successful designer, entrepreneur and celebrity [but with] a humble side to him that keeps things well in perspective and will not allow him to be seduced by success.' Done recently told George Negus that sneers at his 'commercial' art by critics and other artists worried him - 'I'd be tougher than I really am if I told you that it didn't hurt sometimes' - but his business has endured, and his paintings still sell well, particularly in the UK and Japan. Done was named Australia's Father of the Year in 1989 and Mosman Citizen of the Year in 1993 and he was Australia's Goodwill Ambassador to UNICEF in 1993. A large exhibition of his art from the 1980s toured New South Wales between 1991 and 1993. The Powerhouse Museum, the restaurant of which was decorated by Done in the early 1990s, held a large solo exhibition of his work in 1994-1995."

Moving to the Northern Territory in the late 1940s, he worked as a drover and miner, before relocating to Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia. He converted to Baptist Christianity in the mid-1960s, and became a church elder. Shortly after this he began to make shields, boomerangs and coolamons decorated with ochre; he started to paint figuratively on paper, shields and canvas in the early 1980s. One of his repeated themes is the Kurtal, the snake spirit who takes the form of a man, travels across the land and brings rain. However, many of his paintings include Christian imagery, and some combine his traditional stories and personal experiences with Baptist stories; his body of work expresses his philosophy that we 'gotta make 'em whole lot one family'. Downs was represented in many group exhibitions in the 1980s and 1990s, and his work is held by the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of Western Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. In 2016, the exhibition _Jarinyanu David Downs,_ _Kurtal as Self_, held in the artist's community of Fitzroy Crossing, was the first show of his works since his death in 1995."

He went to art school in 1935. In 1938 he took his family to Europe, and studied art in London and Paris, sharing a studio there with Peter Purves Smith, with whom he had gone to school. Having returned to Australia, over the course of the 1940s he produced a series of melancholy, foreboding works - including The Rabbiters, West Wyalong, The Drover's Wife, Sofala and The Cricketers - which not only laid down the terms of reference for most subsequent depictions of the landscape, but came to be seen as key representations of the Australian spiritual condition. In 1962 Drysdale's son took his own life; Drysdale's wife, inconsolable, did the same in 1963. In 1964 Drysdale and his second wife, Maisie, a lifelong friend, built a house in the Bouddi National Park, not far from Tallow Beach. A period of stability followed, and Drysdale was able to produce a further body of significant work over the next fifteen years."

And besides you, peculiar spectacle of a railway running across this former sea bed, ballasted with the fossil remains of these creatures. See, you’ve got all the elements of most extraordinary sort of dramas, I mean, they have an effect, they help one to look at a landscape, they help one to see these peculiar things.\\n\\nI don’t think I can elaborate very much more, really, because it’s quite difficult to talk about one’s own paintings. One just does them, really.\\n\\nEverybody knows the elemental factors that go to make works of art, but when one tries to talk about oneself and one’s point of view, the same old question comes up: you really don’t quite know.

Her fellow students at the George Bell School included Peter Purves Smith and Russell Drysdale, who had been at Geelong Grammar together. In 1937, Purves Smith left for Europe, followed in 1938 by Maisie and her mother. After Maisie returned home Purves Smith cabled his proposal to her but they were separated for the duration of the war. They married in 1946 in Melbourne, with Drysdale as best man; however, Purves Smith died following surgery to relieve symptoms of tuberculosis in 1949. Three years later, Maisie completed studies at the Public Library of Victoria, Library Training School and in 1953 was appointed Deputy Librarian at the City of Coburg Library. Later she was appointed Children's Librarian and given the responsibility of setting up the Children's Library, selecting and cataloguing the books. Having spent a few years managing the Austral Bookshop in Collins Street, from 1958 to 1963 she was Children's Librarian at the Camberwell City Library, and served on the Editorial Committee of the Children's Book Council of Victoria. During this time she also published reviews of children's books. In November 1963, Drysdale's wife died, and seven months later he and Maisie married. They bought a block of land on the Central Coast near Gosford, named it Bouddi Farm, and commissioned Melbourne architect Guilford Bell to design a house for them there. They lived there for the rest of their lives, though they travelled widely; Maisie outlived him by twenty years, and continued to travel."

In the 1960s he travelled and painted in Europe and London before returning to Sydney to teach part time at East Sydney. His first three solo exhibitions were mounted in Sydney from 1963 to 1966, after which he began to exhibit in Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne. Through the 1970s and early 1980s he exhibited often at the Macquarie Galleries. He won Canberra’s Civic Permanent Art Award in 1976 and 1977, and the Sulman Prize in 1981. In the early 1980s, after a period as artist in residence at the University of Melbourne, he lived and worked in Tuscany, developing a meticulous style bearing affinities with those of Balthus and Piero della Francesca. Several of his late exhibitions drew on his repeated visits to Turkey and New Zealand. Dunlop painted about ninety portraits on commission, including one of HM Queen Elizabeth II in 1984. Based in Melbourne and Port Fairy from that year, he staged his final exhibition, the first to feature nudes, at Eva Breuer’s Gallery six months before his death. The National Portrait Gallery owns Dunlop’s portraits of Arvi Parbo, Brian Loton, Joseph Brown, Laurence Cox, Noel Foley and David Dridan, and acquired a portrait of Brian Dunlop by Bryan Westwood in 2006."

But I’ve always painted just the people I felt like painting, for myself. But there seems to be such a shortage of portrait painters that people are looking for a bit of new blood, and a lot of the people who do portrait commissions in Australia are getting very old and unable to cope much anymore, and they’ve done so many, people are a bit sick of them. And let’s face it, most of them are very boring paintings. So, I’ve taken on the challenge and I think eventually I’ll be able to do reasonable portrait commissions. I can do a workmanlike job now, but I seem to be a little bit inhibited, scared to let myself go, because of having to please the people who commission them.\\n\\nWith the portrait commissions, I often do sketches, I usually do some sketches beforehand and then work on the actual painting on the spot. I don’t like working from sketches or from photos, I like to have the person there. And it’s most extraordinary what happens. I swear people’s faces change right in front of your eyes. Colour – even the colours change – or maybe I’m changing and seeing it differently, but it’s most extraordinary. I always paint them on their territory, I don’t bring them around to my studio, because they’re more relaxed on their territory and they feel more confident.",

                    "content": "Max Dupain OBE (1911–1992) was a pioneering modernist photographer. Born in Sydney, he received his first camera as a teenager and trained with photographer Cecil Bostock while working as his assistant. After setting up his own studio in 1934, Dupain established his reputation with portraiture and advertising work, gained exposure in the lifestyle magazine _The Home_, and photographed ballet dancers for the ABC, including dancers from the Kirsova Ballet and the three Ballets Russes companies that toured Australia between 1936 and 1940. While Dupain was on service during the Second World War, he briefly worked for the Department of Information from 1945 to 1947, photographing Australia for propaganda purposes. His then-wife Olive Cotton, one of very few professional women photographers in Australia, ran his studio. In the 1950s Dupain turned increasingly to architectural photography, collaborating in particular with architects Samuel Lipson, Sydney Ancher and Harry Seidler. From 1958 to 1973 he documented the construction of the Sydney Opera House. During the same period, he began photographing historic properties for the National Trust and recorded Canberra's new buildings for the National Capital Development Commission. In 1975 the Australian Centre for Photography mounted the touring exhibition _Max Dupain: A Retrospective 1930–1975_. This show brought Dupain's name to the attention of the wider public, and turned _The Sunbaker_, taken nearly 40 years earlier, into a definitive Australian image. Dupain continued to operate his studio on Sydney's Lower North Shore until he died at the age of 81."

And I looked through the catalogue of the retrospective exhibition just to check, and I find that all these pictures that I have in this show, 81 out of about 4,000, represent my responses to the environment in which I find myself, and that’s all there is to it. There’s nothing world-shattering in any of these shots, they are just a simple and largely emotional response to an environment. Just little things: there might be grass growing in the sand, it might be a person, it might be a landscape at dusk, it might be an industrial operation at night. But this is my world. And I have no favourites. I just hope and worked towards the end that photography to me is my way of expressing my personal response to my environment. And that’s all there is to it.\\n\\nJust by way of a diversion, there’s a picture in the exhibition called _The Meat Queue_, which is a very good example of how lucky can you be. It consists of four or five old mums in a meat queue just after the war, in Sydney. I was doing a story on queues for the Department of Information at the time. I was in this butcher’s shop and I just suddenly saw this action, and it was all over in a fraction of a second. There’s movement in it, there’s a lot of intense feeling on the faces of these people, these women, and it has been one of the most, one of the favourite pictures in this show. But just sheer luck. There were half a dozen other photographs taken of this queuing operation in this butcher’s shop at the time and not one of them are anything like this one.",

It has to be manipulated.\\n\\nOut of this great conglomeration of photo machinery, I have selected a few cameras which I try to keep to a minimum. My favourite camera is the Linhof, it’s a 5 x 4 format, and I come back to this thing time and time and time again. We use a Hasselblad also for quick work, particularly for portrait work, and also a 35 mm camera. You can do an awful lot of work with those three cameras, and I try and keep it in that simple form.\\n\\nThe same applies to film and print paper. For black and white work, we use one line of Kodak film, and our print paper all comes from Ilford which we consider the best available here.\\n\\nNow, for colour work, which is supposed to be the up-and-coming thing but I doubt it very much – I’m essentially a black and white man but we do a lot of colour work because we have to – but until colour becomes a very much more controllable operation, I think black and white will still be, or will remain the intrinsic, inherent photographic medium. If you go to an exhibition of colour photography by a dozen photographers, it’s very, very hard to find out who’s done what, they all look exactly alike, because the operation is essentially a mechanical one and the personal ingredient is minimised.",

Dyer was born in Hobart and studied at the Tasmanian School of Art between 1965 and 1968. He started exhibiting in the 1970s while working as a teacher and then a lecturer, initially at the Launceston School of Art and then at Burnie Technical College. In 1995, he won an Art Gallery of NSW residency at the Cité Internationale des Arts, Paris. Primarily a landscape artist, much of Dyer’s work was inspired by Tasmania, his subjects including such iconic places as the Franklin River, the South West World Heritage Area, Cradle Mountain and Lake St. Clare. He was a finalist in the Wynne Prize nine times (1977, 1988–1993, 1997, 2004); and the Sulman Prize twice (1997, 2006). Dyer painted one portrait per year (generally of a fellow Tasmanian) for entry in the Archibald Prize. He became an Archibald finalist for the first time in 1993 with his portrait of environmentalist and former federal leader of The Greens, Bob Brown; and ten years later took out the Prize with his portrait of novelist Richard Flanagan. He was again a finalist in the 2011 prize for his portrait of MONA founder, David Walsh. Dyer was commissioned by the Tasmanian Government to paint the official portrait of former state Premier Paul Lennon for the Parliament House collection. Dyer exhibited regularly in solo and group exhibitions since 1970 and his work is represented in many collections, including those of Artbank; the University of Tasmania; the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Hobart; the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Launceston aand the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Hobart."

Her 1995 bust of Sir Gustav Nossal is in the collection of the National Library and was exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery's 1996 exhibition, _The Clever Country: Scientists in Australia_. Edgar has undertaken a number of commissions including seven portrait sculptures of motor sport champions for the Hall of Fame at the National Motor Racing Museum in Bathurst. She was commissioned by the Melbourne Symphony to sculpt a commemorative bronze relief portrait of Hiroyuki Iwaki, conductor of the Orchestra for 33 years. Her portrait sculpture of Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, founding patron of the Australian National Academy of Music, is a feature of the foyer of their headquarters in the South Melbourne Town Hall. Edgar's busts are created in many stages, involving building up a clay sculpture; forming wax and rubber moulds; bronze casting; and then grinding, rubbing back and detailing through patination. She has exhibited at many regional and commercial galleries and her work was hung in the Blake Prize for Religious Art in 1988. The National Portrait Gallery acquired her bronze busts of Peter Brock in 2001, Jack Brabham in 2005 and Faith Bandler in 2007."

The son of a country doctor, Elliott grew up scrambling around the lush country near Bellingen, NSW; through his grandfather, who had taught Henry Lawson, family friends included artists Norman Lindsay, Elioth Gruner, Arthur Streeton and Lloyd Rees. After witnessing his father delivering the Sara quadruplets in 1950, he was inspired to become a doctor, and in 1958 went with his family to London to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology. He later became head of gynaecological oncology at King George V Hospital in Sydney, and president of both the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Asian and Oceanic Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. For many years, Elliott worked as a volunteer in Asia and Oceania, training local surgeons and often operating in open-air theatres with low light and sterility. In his spare time, he pursued his passion for art collecting, enjoying close relationships with gallery owners and artists including Fred Williams, Bill Robinson, Frank Hodgkinson and Russell Drysdale. He is credited with keeping many emerging artists in business through encouraging his friends to buy their works. Elliott was a significant philanthropist, although his gifts were mostly anonymous. In 2011 the SH Ervin Gallery mounted an exhibition of his collection, _Up Close and Personal_. Gavin Fry's book _The Peter Elliott Collection_ was published in 2013. The Mossgreen auction of his collection in August–September 2015 was widely reported to have grossed more than seven million dollars."

Everyone told me you can’t believe how fast it is and how many people there are and not only is it the most competitive with the deepest quality field, the most competitive field to race in, therefore the hardest to win at, it also goes far beyond the sport in terms of the public, the spectators, the number of spectators, but also the type of spectators. You’re still in a bike race and you’re racing along roads but all of a sudden you’re racing in a crowd of maybe a soccer stadium. And yeah, that’s sort of one race where you’ll probably get beers spilt on you once while you’re racing a bike. There might be 100, 200, 300 thousand people standing on the side of the road, and they all want to see one rider and if you’re in the yellow jersey that’s really quite unlike anything else I’ve experienced in life. I wouldn’t say it’s healthy, three weeks is a long time to be in the limelight like that.\\n\\nObviously my 2011 Tour de France victory is what sort of shaped me as a bike rider and, I suppose, as an Australian sports person. I’m proud of how I got there and how I worked and the difficulties that I overcame to get there. Two years previously I became world champion on the road, I won the 2009 World Championship road cycling world championships and that was in a moment of difficulty. A lot of people in the world of cycling didn’t believe in me. But I believed in myself, and I had a few key people around me believe in me and together we overcame what seemed like very difficult odds to do something that was at that moment in my sport in some ways historic.\\n\\nMy biggest thing that motivated me through my career was that one day, my opportunity’s going to end and when that day comes I don’t want to have any regrets that I didn’t’ work hard enough, that I didn’t try hard enough, didn’t make enough sacrifices or I wasn’t dedicated enough. And when that day did come, I crossed the finish line of my last race and I left the world of competitive cycling at the top level in complete peace, with some pride and a great deal of satisfaction of what I had the opportunity to achieve and with those opportunities, what I achieved.",

In 1930, aged 36, Evatt became the youngest judge ever appointed to the High Court of Australia. Elected to Federal Parliament in 1940, he held the seat of Barton for 18 years. From 1941 to 1949 he was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs, and during this period he also served as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In 1951, he became Leader of the Opposition. In 1949, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was established, and soon thousands of supposed communists were threatened with jail in the event of a war. When Prime Minister Menzies attempted to outlaw the Communist Party in Australia, Evatt led the effort to defeat the proposal. A referendum saw the Party’s legitimacy confirmed. Evatt led the Labor Party until 1960."

By the time of the birth of their sons, William junior and John (1804–1877), Fairfax senior was involved in the furniture trade. Widowed in 1835, she emigrated to New South Wales with John, his wife Sarah (née Reading, 1808–1875), and their three children in 1838. Three years later, John Fairfax, in partnership with journalist Charles Kemp, purchased the Sydney Herald, which became the Sydney Morning Herald in 1842. By the mid-1850s, John Fairfax, with his sons Charles John Fairfax (1829–1864) and James Reading Fairfax (1834 –1919), owned the Herald outright, building a highly successful publishing enterprise and a family association with the paper that would last almost 150 years. Elizabeth was remembered by her grandson James as ‘a woman of strong religious convictions’ who greatly influenced her son’s contributions to the Congregational Church in the colony. ‘It was her teaching and inheriting her strong character that led to [John Fairfax’s] success in life and in placing her sons and grandsons where they are’, he said. Elizabeth died in Sydney, aged 83, in 1861."

He completed a BA and a Masters in Fine Arts at RMIT, graduating in 2005. A finalist in the Shirley Hannan National Portrait Award and several other prizes during 2006 and 2007, Fantauzzo truly emerged onto the portrait scene when his striking painting of his friend Heath Ledger took out the coveted People's Choice Award at the 2008 Archibald Prize. The portrait was acquired for the Art Gallery of New South Wales collection, and Fantauzzo won the People's Choice Award again in 2009, 2013 and 2014. In 2011, his Archibald-shortlisted portrait of chef Matt Moran won the Packing Room Prize; and his painting of director Baz Lurhmann was awarded the Moran National Portrait Prize the same year. In 2015, he made the first of several painting trips to Central Australia, where he collaborated with Wentja Napaltjarri, Tommy Watson, Gloria Petyarre and Kudditji Kngwarreye to create a series of triptychs. In 2018, he was commissioned by the Historic Memorials Committee to create the official portrait of Julia Gillard for the Parliament House collection. The National Portrait Gallery commissioned Fantauzzo in 2020 to create a portrait of Hugh Jackman, the first representation of the famed Australian for the collection.\\n\\nFantauzzo has held solo shows regularly since 2003 and his work has featured in many group exhibitions throughout Australia. He has said that his goal as an artist is to bridge the gap between art and the general public: 'My big passion is to make art accessible in the same way chefs have done with cooking. You know if you ask the average person to name five artists they can't. But if you ask them to name five criminals, or five chefs, they can'."

And when you get to know people, you learn so much from them. So I think I just became interested in people.\\n\\nSo Hugh asked for me to do his portrait. We actually share a lot of mutual friends, but you never know, it’s like going on a blind date with someone, you meet up with them and you actually have a real great connection. Photography’s a big part of the portrait to me and I normally film people and just base the portrait on all my images and film so I can see those moments. Hugh’s son is very into art and quite creative and he wanted to bring his son along for the photo shoot. So I had a plan up my sleeve that I was gonna ask his son to talk to his Dad and pull the trigger on a camera. And then the virus hit. And then Hugh called me up the night before he was coming to do photographs at my house and said, ‘If I don’t jump on a plane tonight then I’m gonna get shut out of the U.S.’ And his family was there, so they had to fly off and that didn’t happen. And then I made a video for Deb, Hugh’s wife, on how to shoot the portrait and I think because Deb took the pictures there’s this beautiful look in … The painting’s quite different to the photograph because I made it black and white and added my own touch to it, but there’s a look in Hugh’s eyes and you can tell it’s a conversation with someone that he knows and trusts, it’s not a GQ photo shoot which is probably great images as well. But I didn’t want that; I wanted that intimacy we spoke about. So I think there’s a love and intimacy that I think I’ve got.",

                    "content": "Herbert 'Bert' Flugelman, sculptor, painter and lecturer, came to Australia from his native Vienna in 1938, aged fifteen. In the late 1940s he trained at the National Art School; he travelled and studied overseas through the first half of the 1950s. In 1967 he won first prize at the Mildura Sculpture Triennial with a large cast-iron equestrian piece. His subsequent public commissions include the untitled copper and ceramic mosaic fountain at Bruce Hall at the Australian National University; _Spheres_ 1977 (known locally as _Bert’s Balls_) for the Rundle Street Mall, Adelaide; and the _Dobell Memorial_ 1978 for Martin Place, Sydney. Controversially, _Tumbling cubes (Dice) (Untitled)_ 1978/1979, originally made for Cameron Offices in Belconnen ACT, was some years ago moved to a nearby park, according to the artist a 'hopelessly inappropriate site'. _Cones_ 1982 dominates the Sculpture Garden at the National Gallery of Australia, and the _Winged figure (Lawrence Hargrave memorial)_ 1988 towers 6m high at Mt Keira, near Wollongong. Flugelman taught from 1973 to 1983 at the South Australian School of Art, and from 1984 to 1990 at the University of Wollongong, from which he received an honorary doctorate. There was a retrospective exhibition of his five decades' work at the Drill Hall Gallery, Australian National University in 2009."

                    "content": "Sue Ford (née Winslow, 1943–2009), photographer, filmmaker and photo-media artist, grew up in the beachside suburbs of Melbourne and became interested in photography while on holiday in Europe at age 17. Aged 18, she enrolled in a photography course at RMIT and managed a small commercial studio in the city until 1967. Ford married in the mid-1960s; her two children, a daughter and son, were born in 1967 and 1968 respectively. Her break-out solo exhibition, Metamorphoses Series, was shown at the Hawthorn City Art Gallery and at the Yellow House, Sydney in 1971; her exhibition Time Series followed at Brummels Gallery, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney, in 1974 and 1975. Ford’s work of the 1960s and 70s was feminist in approach and, like that of photographers such as Carol Jerrems and Sandy Edwards, explored women’s everyday lives and the politics of representation. Her book of portraits, One sixtieth of a second – portraits of women 1961-1981, was published in 1987, photos from the series having been shown as an exhibition in Melbourne and Sydney in 1982. During the late 1980s, Ford became increasingly interested in Indigenous issues, travelling and photographing in Central Australia and later producing series such as From Van Diemen’s Land to Videoland (1990-92) and Shadow Portraits (1994) which looked at issues of race, representation and colonisation. One of the founders of the Reel Women filmmaker’s co-operative, Ford’s film, Faces 1976-1996, was nominated for an AFI award in 1997. A survey exhibition of her work was shown at Monash Gallery of Art in 1995; in all, by the time of her death from cancer in April 2009, Ford had held more than 20 solo exhibitions, including shows at the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. In addition, her work had featured in many important group shows, among them the 1982 Biennale of Sydney, Living in the 70s: Australian Photographs (NGA, 1987), Shades of light: photography and Australia (NGA, 1988) and the NPG’s Mirror with a Memory: Photographic Portraiture in Australia (2000). The first Australian woman photographer to have a solo exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria (in 1974), she will be the subject of a retrospective exhibition there in mid-2014."

After fighting in the Bellerophon at Trafalgar, in 1818 he made his first Arctic voyage, a fruitless expedition to locate the Northwest Passage, a sea route linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. He ventured to the Arctic again in 1819, leading a three year, 8000 kilometre expedition across Canada, following which he became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. From 1824 to 1828 he commanded another expedition to the Arctic which was rewarded with a knighthood, an honorary doctorate from Oxford, and the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society of Paris. After 30 years of naval service, he accepted an appointment as lieutenant-governor of Tasmania, arriving in Hobart in 1837. Franklin, his second wife Jane (nee Griffin, 1791-1875) and his private secretary Alexander Maconochie brought progressive ideas about the cultural development of the colony and the reformation of the penal system, but powerful colonists, who profited from convict labour, harried him until he was recalled in 1843. Franklin disappeared on his final expedition to the Arctic in 1845. Jane Franklin sponsored four expeditions to find him before it was eventually established that he and all of his crew had perished."

Born in New Zealand, Fredrikson’s training as an artist began with classes at the Wellington Polytechnic College, which he undertook while working as a journalist and reviewer. In the early 1960s, having completed a theatre design apprenticeship, he moved to Australia and assisted with the design for the Australian Ballet’s _Aurora’s Wedding_ (1964). Resident designer for the Melbourne Theatre Company from 1966 to 1974, he designed a great number of productions for the Australian Ballet, the Australian Opera, the Western Australian Opera, the South Australian Opera and the Sydney Theatre and Sydney Dance Companies. From 1975 onwards, Fredrikson collaborated regularly with Graeme Murphy, working with him on many productions including _Body of Work_ for the Sydney Dance Company and _Tivoli_, a co-production with the Australian Ballet. His numerous awards include three Helpmann Awards and an Australian Dance Award for services to dance (1999). The Arts Centre Melbourne presented a retrospective exhibition of his work in 1995, and in 2008 the _Kristian Fredrikson Scholarship for Design in the Performing Arts_ was established in his memory."

On her victory lap, she famously carried both the Australian and Aboriginal flags. Born in Mackay, Queensland, Freeman's mother is of the Kuku Yalanji people, born on Palm Island, and her father was of the Burri Gubba people, born in Woorabinda. Just eight years old when she won her first race at a school athletics carnival, Freeman was coached initially by her stepfather. She had won a number of national titles before earning scholarships to boarding schools in Kooralbyn and Toowoomba, where she trained with professional coaches. Aged sixteen, she was selected for the Australian women's 4 x 100m relay team that took out the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, making her the first Aboriginal athlete to win a Commonwealth Games gold medal. She won two more gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in Canada in 1994 with victories in the 200m and 400m. The first Aboriginal track and field athlete to represent Australia at the Olympic Games, she won a silver medal in the 400m in Atlanta in 1996. She was ranked first in the world in her signature event, the 400m, in which she won back-to-back World Championships in 1997 and 1999. The first person to be named both Young Australian of the Year (in 1990) and Australian of the Year (in 1998), Freeman retired from running in July 2003, still enjoying the immense popularity she earned during her exceptional career. The Cathy Freeman Foundation, established in 2007, continues to enhance educational opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in remote communities."

From 1942 he was in the Australian military forces, and in Melbourne became acquainted with William Dobell, Arthur Boyd and Sidney Nolan. He first exhibited in Melbourne in 1944. After demobilisation in 1947, he studied at East Sydney Technical College, where he became friends with Guy Warren and Tony Tuckson. Having won the Mosman Art Prize in 1949 he left Australia in 1950, returning to Europe to see art; he intended to return here, but did not. However, he continued to catch up with his Australian friends when they came to London. One of Friedeberger's drawings in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia is of Douglas Annand drawing at the V and A in 1951; the NGA also has a Christmas card he made for Annand in the 1950s. From the 1980s onwards Friedeberger's work became increasingly abstract. He exhibited regularly including with Australian artists working in London. Friedeberger died in 2019 at the age of 97."

She began writing the food pages in womens' magazines in the early 1950s. Her first of a plethora of cookbooks, _The Margaret Fulton Cookbook_, was published in 1968. It sold more than a million copies and remains a staple in many kitchens around the country. Her sensible and practical approach to food is the key to her popularity. In 1999 she published _I Sang for my Supper_. Part memoir, part social history, the book documents her life and the changing social and cultural scene in Australia since the 1920s. Fulton has been honoured with many awards including an OAM in 1983."

                    "content": "Sir Hudson Fysh KBE DFC (1895-1974) was one of Australia's great aviation administrators. Born in Launceston, Tasmania, he enlisted at the beginning of World War I and served in the Australian Flying Corps as an observer, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1919 he qualified as a pilot. Later that year he was commissioned by the government to survey the Darwin to Longreach section of the Britain-Australia Air Race, which lack of funds had prevented him from entering. In November 1920 Fysh and Pat McGinnis, who had driven with him on the survey, joined two others to form Queensland and Northern Territory Air Services Ltd (QANTAS). Fysh became managing director of the company in 1923, but continued to work as a pilot over the next seven years as QANTAS established various routes and functions - including an air ambulance service - in Queensland. In 1934, in partnership with Imperial Airways, QANTAS began to operate the Singapore-Australia air route, trading as Qantas Empire Airways (QEA). Six years later Fysh became a director of Tasman Empire Airways Ltd, which flew to and from New Zealand. Fysh oversaw further expansion of QEA, and its purchase by the Australian government, before retiring as the company's managing director in 1955 and chairman in 1966. Between 1965 and 1973, he published three autobiographical volumes covering the history of Qantas; a biography of Henry Reed, a key figure in the early development of Launceston; and book on trout fishing, Round the Bend in the Stream."

Settling in Melbourne, he became involved with photography and filmmaking, working with the ABC and training as a teacher. In the early days of the alternative theatre group the Pram Factory, he recorded productions and took portraits of actors and other performers including dancers at work at Margaret Lasica’s Modern Dance Ensemble. Applause Please and the widely-distributed Soft Soap, two of his early short films, featured Max Gillies; Camberwell Junction (1975) became something of a cult classic on the Melbourne and Sydney independent film scenes. While Gaal was a key figure in the Melbourne Filmmakers’ Cooperative, having graduated from the Swinburne Film School in 1978 he worked at the Victorian Department of Education, directing many short films and documentaries including Tandberg on page 1 and Ibrahim (1983-1984), the latter exploring the experience of a teenaged refugee from Lebanon. Gaal was a finalist in the National Photographic Portrait Prizes of 2013 and 2015. Thirteen of his short films are held by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne. His work is favourably re-evaluated by prolific and esteemed film theorist Adrian Martin in ‘Comment, think, analyse, experience and learn: The neglected film work of Ivan Gaal’, Metro 2013.\\n\\nIvan Gaal believes his photograph of his friend George Spartels helped the actor win roles early in his career."

Emerging as one of England's leading ceramicists in the 1950s, she returned with her husband to Australia in 1960; together they set about building a modern house in Paddington, while starting the first urban action group in Sydney to help save the area. Unlike other ceramicists at the time, Gazzard used hand-building techniques to create sculptural forms inspired by Cycladic sculpture and pre-Colombian pottery. In 1973, with fibre artist Mona Hessing, Gazzard was one of the first craftspeople invited to exhibit at the National Gallery of Victoria. The exhibition, _Clay + Fibre_, generated much discussion about whether craft was art and accelerated acceptance of women artists. Through the 1970s and 1980s she exhibited large abstract works in a number of important group shows as well as solo exhibitions. Gazzard was also instrumental in the development of craft in Australia, including helping to set up the Crafts Council of Australia in 1971 and chairing the Crafts Board of the Australia Council in 1973. President of the World Crafts Council from 1980 to 1984, Gazzard was commissioned to create the bronze sculpture _Mingarri: The Little Olgas_ (1988), which stands in the central Executive Courtyard of Parliament House, Canberra. A major retrospective of her work was held at the SH Ervin Gallery in 1994, accompanied by a book by Christine France, _Marea Gazzard: Form and Clay_. Gazzard's _Bindu_ (2004) was commissioned for the Athens Olympic Games. The Art Gallery of New South Wales acquired her last major work, _Selini I_ (2009), in 2012."

Sometimes I’m asked where I get my ideas from and it’s hard to say, sometimes it might be sitting in a movie, just a certain shape flicks across the screen and I think ‘That’s just what I’m looking for’, or on a beach a piece of driftwood, or in the park a squashed fig. Anything can supply it when you’re looking, when you’re feeling the need for a new idea.\\n\\nI’d say that the curve is the thing that interests me, seldom the straight line in an object. I’m very sensitive to curves, a wrong curve can ruin it from the first half-inch. If I know it’s somehow not going to be right, I just break it up. I break up a lot of things; in fact in my studio at the moment I can see six or eight things that I will no doubt smash up. Perhaps it’s the scale that’s important in what I do. I keep being dissatisfied with small things, though they can be fun to do at times. I want to do bigger, more massive objects.\\n\\nI never feel so happy as when I’m quietly working alone. And I have everything here to make my work, the kiln, all. An artist has to be very close to his work. I know when I’ve been looking in museums, I’ve often felt that I’ve known the person who’s made that object. Perhaps this doing of one’s own work, one’s own thing, perhaps this is the link between civilisations. Other civilisations have tried to leave us what they knew. Perhaps this is what it’s about.",

Born in Budapest, Gemes moved to Australia with her family in 1949. She studied at Sydney University, worked in theatre and wrote for the _International Times_ in London on and off until 1971. In the 1970s she became involved in the Yellow House at Potts Point, Sydney and worked in Central Australia on the film _Uluru_ (1978). She held her first solo exhibition, _We Wait No More_, in 1982; the same year she exhibited photographs in the group shows _After the Tent Embassy_ and _Apmira: Artists for Aboriginal Land Rights_. In 1984 she set up the Camera Future Photographers Cooperative Studio in Kings Cross and became a member of the Australian Journalists' Association Freelance committee. Two years later she established Paper Bark Press (1986–2010) with her partner, poet Robert Adamson; they live on the Hawkesbury River where she has a photography studio. Her 1997 series _The Language of Oysters_ documents the lives of oyster farmers on the Hawkesbury, raising questions of sustainability. In 2003 the National Portrait Gallery exhibited her portraits of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reconciliation activists and personalities, _Proof: Portraits from the Movement 1978–2003_, and has since acquired many of her photographs. Gemes was one of ten photographers invited to document that National Apology in Canberra in 2008. The Macquarie University Art Gallery held a survey exhibition of her work, _The Quiet Activist: Juno Gemes_, in 2019."

Mostly self-taught, Gerber came to prominence as an artist in Australia in the late 1980s, with works that investigate modes of representation used throughout the history of European painting up to the present day. His practice ranges from representational landscapes to abstract images and installations and from photorealism to geometric abstraction as he 'seeks out the failings of images' and superimposes contradictory painting techniques. Gerber has worked in the Sydney University Power Studio in Paris, and in The Hague under the Samstag Scholarship. He is senior lecturer of painting at Sydney College of the Arts, University of Sydney and exhibits regularly in Australia and overseas. His remarkably diverse works are held by the National Gallery, the state galleries of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and numerous regional, corporate and university collections."

Soon a lead dancer, he performed with the Royal Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, the New York City Ballet and the American Festival Ballet before returning to Launceston in 1960. There he created Tasmania's first ballet studio, built behind his house in Wellington Street. He ran the Tasmanian Ballet School for many years, from which the performing ensemble known as the Tasmanian Ballet was founded in 1961. Gillespie travelled around Tasmania to give classes. His students included not only Graeme Murphy, who credits him as his mentor, but also Michelle Hawkins, Natasha Middleton, Claire McHugh and Glenn Murray. The Tasmanian Ballet performed and toured around Australia regularly, including in many primary schools, with Gillespie involved in every aspect of all its productions from 1961. By 1975 it was a state and federally funded professional company. Gillespie was its director until he retired in 1979 and moved to Newcastle for the climate. He received a knighthood from the Order of St John of Malta and of Rhodes in 1989."

Giurgola studied in his native Italy before moving to the USA where he held academic positions at Cornell and Columbia universities, and co-founded Mitchell/Giurgola Architects in Philadelphia. By the early 1960s his style, mixing modernist and inclusive flavours, saw him identified as a key member of the ‘Philadelphia School’. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the American Society of Architects in 1982, while work on New Parliament House was under way. In 1988 Aldo Giurgola settled in Canberra. He designed a tiny Catholic church in the suburb of Charnwood and a home for himself at Lake Bathurst, near Goulburn; both are represented in Martin’s painting. Giurgola is depicted by the pool in the Members’ Hall in the centre of Parliament House. The diagonal shaft of light echoes that in Tom Roberts’s ‘big picture’ of the opening of the First Parliament in 1901."

                    "content": "James Gleeson AO was Australia's best-known surrealist artist, and from the late 1930s onwards he was a tireless supporter of Australian modern art. Deeply interested in psychology, he wrote poetry and many essays and several books on Australian art. His own art has been the subject of several major exhibitions. As a young boy he lived at Gosford on the New South Wales Central Coast and much of his art work has been inspired by the beach rock pools from his youth, 'full of marvellous shapes' and 'biomorphic forms'. For Gleeson the littoral zone where sea meets land was a powerful metaphor for the interplay of the conscious and unconscious mind and of the fluid nature of existence. Gleeson reflected that 'One of the most important and constantly recurring motifs throughout my work is based on a sense of the mutability of all forms and substances. Metamorphosis has always been, for me, one of the basic facts of life. Everything takes on a form, changes, falls apart and reforms in new organisations in an endless cycle.'"

With this new vision of what reality could mean, I began to become really seriously interested in art.\\n\\nThat was my first real understanding of the significance of art as a way of coming to grips with life, of understanding life; and that I think is the essential meaning of art. I don’t feel it’s a way of decorating a room, certainly not for an artist at any rate, it’s a way of coming to grips with reality, a way of getting to know what you yourself are like or what the world around you is like. And it seemed to me that surrealism, as a theory at any rate, offered enormous scope, and I felt that with the Surrealists, that the world of seeming – of things as they seem to be – was not the true world at all; that in the subconscious mind there were all sorts of images, ideas which were a part of reality, and, as a painter, I tried to express this subconscious material, or some of the images from it, at any rate.",

                    "content": "Peter Goldsworthy AM (b. 1951), medical doctor and writer, was born in Minlaton, South Australia, and grew up in various country towns as his father, a school teacher, moved for work. Goldsworthy studied medicine at the University of Adelaide, and after graduating in 1974 worked in drug and alcohol rehabilitation while starting to write. His first book of poetry, _Readings from Ecclesiastes_, won the Commonwealth Poetry Prize for a debut collection, the South Australian Premier’s Award, and was joint winner of the Fellowship of Australian Writers’ Anne Elder Poetry Award in 1982. His first book of short stories, _Bleak Rooms_, was published in 1988 and his debut novel, _Maestro_, appeared the following year. Shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award, _Maestro_ was adapted for the stage in a collaboration between Goldsworthy and his daughter Anna, a concert pianist. Subsequent works include the novels _Honk If You Are Jesus_ (1992), _Wish_ (1995) and _Three Dog Night_ (2003), which won the FAW Christina Stead Award, and _Everything I Knew_ (2008), which was shortlisted for the Prime Minister’s Literature Award. His works have been translated widely, and four have been adapted for the stage, as has the short story _The Kiss_. Also an essayist and screenwriter, Goldsworthy wrote the libretti for Richard Mills’ operas _Summer of the Seventeenth Doll_ and _Batavia_, the latter winning him and Mills the 2002 Helpmann Award for the best new Australian work, and a Green Room Award for special creative achievement. His most recent collection of short stories, _Gravel_ (2010), was shortlisted for the ASAL Gold Medal. His _Stupid Boyhood: a Memoir_ was published in 2013. The stage adaptation of _Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam_ (1993) is taking place in 2018. _The Minotaur_, his first novel in a decade, and an opera based on the lives of Ned and Ellen Kelly (written with the composer Luke Styles), are appearing in 2019."

                    "content": "Robert Hannaford AM (b. 1944), a largely self-taught artist, grew up on his family farm near the small South Australian town of Riverton before working as political cartoonist for the _Adelaide Adverti_ser from 1964 to 1967. In 1969 he won the inaugural AME Bale Scholarship. He took up painting full-time in 1970 with the encouragement of the veteran South Australian portraitist, Sir Ivor Hele. He has been a favourite in both the Archibald Prize – in which he has been a finalist 26 times, and won the People's Choice Award three times – and the Doug Moran Portrait Prize, which he won in 1990. Much in demand as an official portraitist, he painted the Historic Memorials Committee's official prime-ministerial portrait of Paul Keating and the official Centenary of Federation painting that now hangs in Parliament House alongside Tom Roberts' 'Big Picture'. In 2015 the Art Gallery of South Australia showed more than 200 of his works in the solo exhibition _Robert Hannaford_. Hannaford works in a studio in Riverton, where has painted hundreds of portraits, his easel placed beneath a skylight that enables him to exploit the full range of daylight. Enjoying the discipline imposed by a commission, he is open to ideas from his sitters about how they would like to be portrayed, finding that they often lead him into new ways of seeing and composing. 'I can find anything interesting,' he says. 'I could look at the corner of the room and find a painting that could keep me going for ages.' The National Portrait Gallery owns his portraits of Dame Joan Sutherland, Robert Dessaix, Alexander Ramsay, Tim Flannery and Lowitja O'Donoghue, the latter painted on commission."

                    "content": "Nicholas Harding (1956–2022) was one of Australia's most highly regarded artists, known for his portraits and drawings, and his light-filled, vigorously painted images of the bush and the coast. Born in London, he came to Australia with his family as a boy and attained a Bachelor of Arts in 1975. After a couple of years travelling in Europe and the UK, he trained as an animator with the cartoon company Hanna Barbera, and then worked as a freelance animator for over twenty years. Meanwhile, he taught himself to paint and was first exhibited in the Sulman Prize in 1980. He held his first solo exhibition with Rex Irwin Art Dealer, Sydney, in 1992, subsequently showing multiple times with Irwin over the next twenty years and exhibiting also with Philip Bacon Galleries, Brisbane and Sophie Gannon Gallery, Melbourne. Harding became known early on for huge pen and ink depictions of the railway tracks and shabby streets of inner Sydney, and the scrubby trees of the beaches of the north coast of New South Wales. His paintings on the same themes, as well as flowers, and beach and river scenes, became much sought-after by collectors. He won the Mosman Art Prize in 1993 and from that year onward featured regularly in the Archibald Prize, the Wynne Prize, the Dobell Drawing Prize, the Sulman Prize and the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize. In 2001, the first of several triumphant years, Harding won the Dobell Prize and triumphed in the Archibald with his _Portrait of John Bell as King Lear_. A major retrospective of his work, _Nicholas Harding: Drawn to Paint_, was exhibited at the SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney in 2010; and the Tweed Regional Gallery presented _Carving Light and Landscape_ in 2015. In 2017 the National Portrait Gallery presented _Nicholas Harding: 28 Portraits_, which encompassed everything from swiftly-executed portraits of anonymous sitters that Harding sketched mid-flight on airline sick bags, to lush, large scale paintings of sitters including writer Robert Drewe and actor Hugo Weaving – both of which are held in the NPG’s collection. \\n\\nHarding held residencies at the Cité des Arts Internationales in Paris (2013) and at Bundanon, New South Wales (1998). His work is represented in private, corporate and public collections internationally and at home, including those of the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Art Gallery of South Australia and the National Portrait Gallery."

She met her future husband Hal Hattam, a Scottish-born Australian obstetrician and artist, while he was in England with the Australian Imperial Force. She started her career in the advertising department of Harrods before returning with Hal to Melbourne, where she found marketing work with Georges, then the city's most fashionable department store. Balancing work with raising her first three children, she quickly rose to the position of advertising manager, where she was at one time said to be the highest-paid woman in Australia. The couple became friends with a group of inner-city intellectuals and aesthetes, and entertained and encouraged many emerging artists who have since become household names. At Kate's behest, artists such as John Perceval, Arthur Boyd and Leonard French designed wrapping paper and greeting cards for Georges, and she is believed to have been influential in securing fair rates of payment for artists engaged in commercial work. The Hattam family homes in Canterbury and South Yarra housed an unrivalled body of works by artists in their circle and beyond, including John Brack, Clifton Pugh, Fred Williams and Sid Nolan, who came to play a substantial role in Australian art in the twentieth century."

Establishing a medical practice in Melbourne, he began to paint with no formal training. After falling in with a group including Arthur Boyd, Charles Blackman, John Perceval, Leonard French, Fred Williams and Clifton Pugh he abandoned medicine for a time to concentrate on his art. Between 1962 and 1988 he held a number of solo exhibitions, mostly of seascapes, that drew admiration from critics including Patrick McCaughey. He participated in many group shows. Hattam and his wife Kate collected a large body of works by artists in their circle and beyond. Patrick McCaughey has said that they were the 'first private collectors to accept and admire [Fred] Williams's very different kind of art in a wholehearted way'. From 1958 onward they built up a substantial group of his works."

                    "content": "Robert James Lee (Bob) Hawke (1929-2019) moved with his family from South Australia to Perth in 1939. Graduating in arts and law from the University of Western Australia, where he was president of the SRC, in 1953 he went to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. There, he wrote a thesis on the history of wage-fixing in Australia and set the world record for drinking a ‘yard’ of beer. In 1958, having abandoned a PhD thesis, he began working as an advocate for the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). He first ran for federal parliament in 1963. Unsuccessful, he was elected president of the ACTU in 1969. In this role for a decade, he made strong friendships with Labor Party and trades union colleagues and travelled internationally to learn about labour issues. In 1971 he was elected to the federal executive of the Australian Labor Party; two years later he became the party’s federal president. Now president of both the ACTU and the Labor Party, he represented both on governing and advisory bodies, such as the Reserve Bank Board, the Australian Population and Immigration Council, and the Monash University Council. Throughout the 1970s, though alcoholic, he maintained a punishing workload. In 1976 he went to Israel, as a guest of the Israeli government, for the dedication of a forest to him. He was invited to China in 1978 as a leader of the trade union movement. In 1979, he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia, delivered the Boyer Lectures on the topic of ‘The resolution of conflict’, and suffered a breakdown. In the spring of 1980, he resigned from the ACTU to win the seat of Wills. He made his first speech in the House of Representatives in 1980 at the age of 50. In winter 1982, returning from Helsinki where he had attended an international socialist conference, Hawke initiated a challenge to Labor party leader Bill Hayden. Knowing that his defeat by Hawke was inevitable, in early 1983 Hayden agreed to step down. Hawke was elected Labor Party leader on 8 February 1983 and the federal election was called for 5 March 1983. Bill Hayden had said that in the current electoral climate, ‘a drover’s dog could lead the Labor Party to victory’. Indeed, after a four-week campaign, Bob Hawke led the Labor Party to their greatest election win in 40 years. Inheriting a deficit of $9 billion, he was to lead the Party to victory for a record four terms, in 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1990. Hawke is widely remembered for his uncontrolled public reaction to Australia’s victory in the America’s Cup in Perth in 1983. The same year, enactment of the _World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983_ gave the Commonwealth responsibility for all places listed as world heritage areas. The government moved for world heritage listing of Tasmania’s forests and the North Queensland rainforests. New uranium mining at Jabiluka was prohibited, and the world heritage listing of Kakadu National Park was prioritised. The _Sex Discrimination Act 1984_ put gender discrimination in workplaces outside the law. The ‘Silver Bodgie’ was the public face of the Bicentenary celebrations throughout 1988. At the same time, the 1980s saw the deregulation of the financial system, the removal of controls on foreign exchange and Australian interest rates, the opening up of competition in the telecommunications industry, the reduction of all tariffs to five per cent and the phasing out of textile, clothing and motor vehicle protection. By 1992 unemployment was to peak at its highest level since the Depression. In 1991 it was Paul Keating’s turn to provoke an open leadership contest. Following a leadership vote just before Christmas, Hawke was narrowly defeated by Keating, who became party leader and was sworn in as Prime Minister on 20 December 1991."

Inspired by an imaginary world, and sometimes described as 'luminist', her paintings often include incorporeal, surrealistic motifs in empty landscapes and express a sense of transience. She has exhibited throughout Australia and abroad, including the Frankfurt Contemporary Art Fair in 1993, _Contempora 5_ in 1999, _Uncommon World: Aspects of Contemporary Australian Art_ in 2000 and _Big Spooks_ in 2005. A major survey of her works from 1990-2016 was shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney in 2016. She has won numerous awards and prizes, including the 2014 Doug Moran National Portrait Prize for a portrait of her long-term partner, artist Bill Henson, and the 2016 Archibald Prize for a portrait of Barry Humphries. Hearman's works are held in public and private collections throughout Australia."

He was Australia's longest-serving official war artist, serving in North Africa, the Middle East and New Guinea during the Second World War and in the Korean War. The Australian War Memorial holds the majority of his works, including intimate landscapes, massive battle-pieces and sensitive drawings in chalk. His postwar paintings were occasionally shown at the _Adelaide_ _Advertiser's_ open-air art exhibitions. Although Hele painted landscapes (mostly of the rocky southern coast of South Australia) and made thousands of erotic paintings and drawings, he was best known as a portrait painter. He was much in demand as an official portraitist and won the Archibald Prize five times between 1951 and 1957, notably with his portrait of Sir Robert Menzies in 1954 and a self-portrait in 1957. Despite his success, he rarely exhibited his works and his last solo exhibition was at the 1970 Adelaide Festival of the Arts. Hele is represented in the National Portrait Gallery's collection with his portraits of Dame Nancy Buttfield, Sir Lloyd Dumas and Claude Charlick."

The son of a sheep farmer and a frustrated actress, Helpmann grew up in Mount Gambier, South Australia. At the age of eleven he made his stage debut, dressed in a tutu, at a charity concert in front of Dame Nellie Melba. Soon after he joined Anna Pavlova's touring company and went to England where by 1934 he was lead male dancer at the Vic-Wells Ballet (later Sadler's Wells). There, he formed a celebrated partnership with Dame Margot Fonteyn. Renowned for his dramatic and innovative ballet choreography, Helpmann was co-director and then director of The Australian Ballet from 1965 to 1976; during this period, in 1965, he was Australian of the Year. He appeared in twelve films, including _The Red Shoes_, which he also choreographed. Renowned for flamboyance and wit, at the age of 60 he performed as Dr Coppélius in The Australian Ballet's _Coppélia_ and he was still dancing two months before his death in the role of the Red King in _Checkmate_."

Markova then decided to leave and start her own company with Anton Dolin. And I thought, ‘Well this is the end of the ballet’, when Ninette de Valois said, ‘I’ve found a girl that you’re going to dance with’, and took me into the classroom and I said, ‘Which one?’ She said, ‘That one over there with the two long plaits’, and I thought, ‘That funny-looking little girl?’ and I said, ‘What’s her name?’ and she said, ‘Peggy Hookham’, and I said, ‘Well, that’s not going to look very good on the notice board is it, Peggy Hookham?’ And I said, ‘She looks Chinese’. And she said, ‘Well as a matter of fact, she was born in Shanghai but she is English. No, she was born in Reigate and she went to Shanghai as a little girl – I want you to work with her’. And the minute, of course, I saw her dance, I realised that she was absolutely wonderful, and Ninette said, ‘She’s going to change her name, she’s going to call herself Margot Fonteyn’. And so from that moment on, I danced with Fonteyn for 27 years and I suppose we became, at that time, the most famous pair dancing in Europe.\\n\\nI’m always asked what was the most memorable performance or production, and it’s impossible really for me to say, because so many things have been memorable to me. My first appearances with Markova, my first appearances with Fonteyn, my first appearances with Vivienne Leigh, the first time I played _Hamlet_, all of them. I have never felt for one minute in my life, ‘I’m a success’. I feel I’ve accomplished something and that is done and therefore there is something more to do. The success or failure of what has passed has passed and I must go on to something else. And whatever else I may have achieved in life, I hope that people will remember that my whole life has been dedicated to producing something of beauty in the theatre.",

From 1926 to 1930 she studied at the School of Fine Arts in Adelaide under F Millward Grey. In 1930 her work was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of South Australia. Her first solo exhibition was held in Sydney three years later. In 1934 she travelled to London with her family, and remained in Europe until 1937 studying and painting. When she returned to Australia she returned briefly to Adelaide and before moving to Sydney, where she lived for the rest of her life. In 1938 she became the first woman to win the Archibald Prize, and in late 1943 she became the first woman to be appointed as an Australian war artist. Commissioned to depict the women’s war effort in the air force, the navy and the army, she completed more than 170 works of art before being discharged from service in New Guinea in 1946. While in New Guinea she met a doctor, Robert Black, whom she later married. Following her discharge from war service she went to London, returning to Sydney in 1948. She continued to paint, exhibit and travel with her husband. Her works are held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, the Australian War Memorial, the National Library of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery and several state galleries."

I’d arranged myself a beautiful native bowl full of flowers and I was sitting in the mess, painting this, when I had a signal to be moved on down to Lae, and I ignored the signal, and the jeep came along to collect me to take me to the airport, and I said, ‘Go away, I’m in the middle of painting flowers’, and I continued with my flowers and got into hot water over this. The signals flew from New Guinea to Melbourne and back, and I was still painting my flowers, refusing to budge.\\n\\nI recall that picture and sticking it out, and I remember painting it on the mess table; I had to move every time a meal was brought forward, and it took me about four or five days to complete it, and I’ve kept that canvas, I called it _The Flower Sip_ and it’s one picture that didn’t go into the Military History Section.

Born in Sydney, Hicks completed a degree in communications at the University of Canberra and then pursued her interest in photography at the ANU School of Art. While earning a living as a commercial photographer, she maintained a private focus on her art photography, and entered various art prizes and exhibitions. In 2003, she won both the Fisher's Ghost Art Award for Contemporary Art in Campbelltown, and the Josephine Ulrick Photography Award for Portraiture in Tweed Heads. Since then, she has been making series of photographs of individuals that strain the definition of portraiture, finding, it has been said, 'beauty in perceived imperfections and render[ing] idealised beauty strange'. She had her first exhibition with Sydney’s inner-city Stills Gallery in 2005, and the following year the National Portrait Gallery included a series of her immaculate, unsettling photographs in the exhibition _Truth and Likeness_. In 2016 she completed a Master of Fine Arts at the Sydney College of the Arts, where she investigated the connection between humans and animals. Over her career Hicks has been represented in many solo and group exhibitions and her works are included in Australian and international collections. The National Gallery of Victoria held a major exhibition of her work _Petrina Hicks: Bleached Gothic_ in 2019–2020."

                    "content": "Francis Henry Critchley Hinder (1906-1992) was a pioneer of abstract art in Australia. He played an important role as a war artist and was a major influence in the development of modern art in Australia. Born in Sydney, he studied under Dattilo Rubbo at the East Sydney Technical College before pursuing his training abroad. He was one of the first Australian artists to break with tradition by studying in the United States rather than in Britain or France, attending courses in Chicago, from 1927-1928 and New York, 1929 -30. Hinder worked as a commercial artist in the US before returning to Sydney in 1934 as a graphic artist and stage designer. Joined by Ralph Balson, Grace Crowley and Rah Fizelle, he enlivened the local art scene with modernist work based on his experience of cubism. Hinder enlisted in 1939 and, with a number of artists, was assigned as an instructor and research officer in the Camouflage unit of the Royal Australian Engineers. As an alternative to the descriptor 'camoufleurs' for the disparate group of artists designing dummy aircraft and guns, Hinder suggested 'camopansies'. After the war, he taught at East Sydney Technical College eventually becoming the Head of Art at the Sydney Teachers College. Hinder's abstract paintings and electric light sculptures (often made with his partner Margel Hinder) attracted much attention and critical acclaim. In 1952 he won the Blake Prize for Religious Art. He served as a Trustee of the Art Gallery of NSW and was awarded the Australia Medal, General Division, Order of Australia in 1979. Highly respected for his contribution to Australian art, Hinder is represented in the Australian War Memorial, the National Gallery of Australia and all state galleries."

It’s quite different to the way I worked previously, when I made very careful and thorough drawings, enlargements, colour sketches and so forth. I feel again, as my wife said, as she feels she’s becoming more on the expressionist side, so my own work in one sense is loosening up, and I find possibly that starting on the job itself and trying to carry it through then possibly either throwing it away or scraping it off and starting again, allows one to do things that are a more definite approach. Sometimes [it] ties down. In other words, I think I tend to be much too tight or worry too much about the little sketches, and in the process of doing that the big one loses a certain amount of spontaneity. I’m quite sure it’s my fault; it’s not in the procedure because the old masters, I understood it, worked that way and certainly their final results, to me, leave nothing to be desired. But again, it’s the method of trying a slightly different approach.\\n\\n[I’m] still working, of course, with theatre, and with this, and at the moment I’m getting back to painting again, as there seems to be less theatre work, and so I have more time too.\\n\\nI should have mentioned previously, of course, one reason I married my wife was, I thought I had one of the best critics, and she’d be very handy to have around, apart from any other reason.\\n\\nAnd as she knows, I usually ask her opinion, and then she gets very irritated if I, not necessarily disagree with her but I still insist, that she says ‘What?’ but I’ve found it’s pretty infallible. In other words, I’m not my own best critic by a long shot, and one needs a certain amount of either support, moral support or an outside view, I think, and I certainly value hers more than anyone else’s.",

                    "content": "Sir Edward Wheewall Holden (1885-1947), industrialist and politician, was the son of Henry Holden, industrialist and civic leader, and the grandson of James Alexander Holden, Adelaide leather and saddlery business owner. The family firm won large saddlery contracts during the Boer War. After 1909 it branched into motor-body trimming, making hoods, bodies, and motor cycle sidecars. Edward Holden started work at Holden and Frost Ltd after graduating with a BSc from the University of Adelaide. His prototype for a standard body for imported chassis, made in collaboration with Dodge distributor SA Cheney, led to the formation of Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd in 1917, with Edward as Managing Director. Producing bodies for the American-owned General Motors from 1923, by that year Holden's was accounting for half the national output of car shells. Edward Holden oversaw the expansion to a large plant at Woodville (the largest outside North America) incorporating the latest technology including automated production lines. By 1929, with 3400 workers, Holden's was the biggest body-builder in the Empire, but late in the year General Motors revised its orders, which had represented about 60% of Holden's output. With the firm struggling to survive, the following year Holden set out for the USA to discuss amalgamation with GM. In 1931 GM bought the company, taking complete control while maintaining its Australian character. Holden became chairman of General Motors-Holden's Ltd. He was its sole managing director until the arrival of Englishman Sir Laurence Hartnett from GM subsidiary Vauxhall Motors in 1934. Embittered, Holden turned to other affairs before resigning from GMH in early 1947. As a Liberal in the Legislative Council from 1935 to 1947 he strongly supported initiatives to attract industry to the South Australia. Honorary controller of army canteens in 1939-1945, after the war he continued with many and various directorships and corporate service with bodies including the South Australian Industries Assistance Corporation, the Chamber of Commerce, the Bank of Adelaide and Australian Cotton Textile Industries. Holden's energetic contribution to public life was perpetuated by his daughter Nancy (later Dame Nancy Buttfield), the first South Australian woman in an Australian parliament."

Working for preference in watercolour, which she allows to bleed and drip, Hood specialises in intense depictions of mostly anonymous subjects. With a studio based in the Southern Tablelands of NSW, she has embraced her landscape surrounds, sometimes incorporating it into her figurative works. In 2000, Hood gained her masters degree from Sydney College of the Arts with a thesis comprising an investigation of 'gender politics and cultural mores and taboos surrounding the representation of the male body'. The following year she held her first solo exhibition at Mori Gallery, Sydney. Since then, she has exhibited in solo and group shows in Australia and internationally, including in the National Portrait Gallery's _Contemporary Australian Portraits_ in 2002. Following her Archibald Prize win in 2002 for her portrait, _Simon Tedeschi unplugged_, she won the Kedumba Drawing Award in 2003. Amongst her portrait subjects are painters Matthys Gerber, Ben Quilty and Michael Zavros, and pianist David Helfgott. Her portrait of Tedeschi is one of a number of Archibald winners in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Hood's works are in state collections around Australia and in public and private collections around the world."

Arriving in Melbourne in 1888, he established a sufficient reputation to be commissioned, in 1896, to carve the pulpit, bishop’s throne and other furnishings for St Paul’s Cathedral. Some three years later he moved to Perth, where he advertised as a sculptor of ecclesiastical items such as fonts and reredoses as well as art furniture, and taught wood carving at the technical school until 1906. In Western Australia he worked in a variety of native timbers, notably jarrah, in which he produced reliefs including ‘Marguerite Leaving the Church’, displayed at the Paris Exhibition of 1900, and ‘Dante and Beatrice’, exhibited in San Francisco in 1915. His sectional model of the Great Boulder Mine was presented to the Princess of Wales in 1904. A jarrah dining suite comprising sideboard, table, six chairs and a side table was exhibited at the Western Australian Exhibition in 1906, and for many years one of his tables carved with a black swan was a highlight of the collection of the West Australian Forests Department."

                    "content": "Barry Humphries AO CBE (1934–2023), actor, writer and artist, was the world's all-time most successful solo theatrical performer. Born in Melbourne, in the early 1950s he commenced studying Law at the University of Melbourne, where he became interested in Dadaism and began performing in revues. Abandoning his degree after two years, he joined the Melbourne Theatre Company and in 1954, while touring regional Victoria with a MTC production of _Twelfth Night,_ he created a character named Edna inspired by the lady mayoresses and other municipal officials he encountered. Mrs (later Dame) Edna Everage made her stage debut in a sketch at Melbourne University’s Union Theatre in December 1955. He revived Edna for revues at Sydney’s Phillip Street Theatre in 1957 and after his return to Melbourne, Humphries created another of his archetypes of suburban mediocrity: the washed-out, ruminative Sandy Stone. In London from 1959, Humphries performed at Peter Cook’s legendary venue The Establishment, and became part of a cohort of comedians and satirists that included Cook, Dudley Moore, Spike Milligan and Alan Bennett. During the 1960s he appeared in several films, numerous West End stage productions and on BBC Television’s _The Late Show._ He also contributed to the satirical magazine _Private Eye,_ for which he created a comic strip about an uber-boorish Australian bloke named Barry McKenzie_._ Back in Australia from 1970, Humphries co-wrote the feature film _The Adventures of Barry McKenzie_ (1972), and premiered another of his best-known characters: the deeply offensive, lecherous ‘cultural attaché’ Les Patterson. Humphries many and varied film credits include roles in _The Getting of Wisdom_ (1977), _The Secret Policeman’s Other Ball_ (1982), _Immortal Beloved_ (1994), _Spice World_ (1997), and _An Unexpected Journey_ (2012) – the first film in Peter Jackson’s three-part adaptation of Tolkien’s _The Hobbit._ In 2003 he was the voice of Bruce, the shark, in the animated film _Finding Nemo_. __Throughout all this time, Humphries remained committed to his true calling and from the 1950s onwards performed his satirical one-man comedy shows in Australia, Britain, Europe and the USA. Edna Everage's wild vigour carried her through such triumphs as _Housewife_, _Super-star; Edna_, _the Spectacle_; _Dame Edna, The Royal Tour;_ and _Eat Pray Laugh!_, which Humphries announced would be her last. Despite once claiming that he took up acting to entertain himself, Humphries’ contribution to his craft was honoured with many prestigious awards including a Mo Award (1989), a British Comedy Award for Lifetime Achievement (1999), a Special Tony Award (2000), the JC Williamson Award (2007), and an Outer Critics Circle Award (2000). Humphries’ was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1982, and in 2007 he was named a Commander of the British Empire for his services to entertainment. He was the subject of the National Portrait Gallery's first large-scale biographical exhibition in 2002, and the following year he gained an honorary doctorate – in Law – from the University of Melbourne. His many books include two different autobiographies, _More Please_ (1992) and _My Life as Me_ (2002) as well as an autobiography of Edna Everage, _My Gorgeous Life_ (1997)."

They wore the uniforms of rebellious university students just as they do today, and in a sense they’re the most conformist of all social groups.\\n\\nI was surprised and disappointed at this, so, again, with the aid of some of my old Melbourne Grammar friends and a few new ones, we reformed the Dada group and we held, in two consecutive years of 1951 and 1952, two widely publicised and spectacular Dada exhibitions in the men’s lounge of the Union at Melbourne University. The catalogues of these two Dada exhibitions survive and are, of course, interesting documents of the period. They consist really of an anarchic attack on certain aspects of modern art which were becoming domesticated – that is to say, Melbourne housewives who knew nothing about art, other than perhaps Arthur Streeton or Hans Heysen on a calendar, were now espousing the post-impressionists, so the exhibitions contained scathing attacks of Van Gogh, Gaugin and Cezanne, indeed on everything that was acceptable to the Australian bourgeoisie, indeed the informed Australian bourgeoisie of this period.\\n\\nThese were happenings, I suppose, though that word hadn’t been coined. As the students came along I would stand on a dais and open the exhibition with a kind of crazy speech and already I was giving vent to a frustrated theatrical energy. I was moving slowly, you know, from painting, from a pictorial language to a theatrical means of self-expression. Within, I was merely a frustrated youth, not at all knowing how best to please my parents, what profession indeed I would ever follow and when was it all going to end?",

Will Huxley was born in Bath, England, emigrating with his family at the age of seven to grow up in the suburbs of Perth. After university, where they both studied photography – Will at Edith Cowan University and Garrett at the Queensland College of Art – the artists gravitated to Melbourne where they met in 2006. The pair soon began to collaborate as The Huxleys, combining their separate practices of photography, filmmaking and costume design, with performance as a key element.

He studied art in Melbourne with Max Meldrum in the early 1940s and also worked for Meldrum as an assistant teacher, becoming a leading exponent of his mentor's theory of perception and the importance of tonal and space relations between objects. After Meldrum's death, Inson moved to Sydney and established a studio in Rowe Street. He held his first solo exhibition in 1954 and in 1955 he opened his own art school. One of the most successful 'Meldrumites', he painted landscapes and still life as well as portraits, travelling widely to paint and holding scores of solo exhibitions in Sydney into the 1990s. \\n\\nInson was commissioned for many official portraits and was twice a finalist in the Doug Moran prize. He entered 41 works in the Archibald Prize between 1952 and 1979. The National Portrait Gallery acquired his 1980 portrait of Gough Whitlam in 2002, his 1953 portrait of Brian Fitzpatrick in 2008; his 1951 portrait of Max Meldrum in 2009; and his portrait of Kevin Weldon in 2012. In 2014, the NPG acquired Inson's painting of his life partner, the artist Ivy Shore."

                    "content": "Akira Isogawa (b. 1964), fashion designer, was born in Kyoto, Japan, and first came to Australia on a working holiday at the age of 21. Excited by what he saw as the country's 'fresh and youthful spirit,' he moved here permanently, working as a waiter by night while studying fashion design at East Sydney TAFE. In 1993 he opened the Akira Isogawa boutique in Woollahra, and swiftly established a reputation for his bold and intelligent clothes. At Sydney's Australian Fashion Week in 1996, he sent all his models out wearing red socks from Gowings because he couldn't afford shoes for them; but he has shown at most Australian Fashion Weeks since, and since 1998 he has shown twice annually in Paris. He has exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art and has featured in the Powerhouse Museum's Fashion of the Year retrospective. Object Gallery's exhibition of his construction techniques in Sydney is said to have been its most successful ever show. At 1999's Australian Fashion Industry Awards he was named Designer of the Year and Womenswear Designer of the Year. The National Gallery of Victoria's _Akira Isogawa: Printemps Eté_ in 2004–2005 was the first solo exhibition of an Australian designer's work to be shown at a major art institution and later toured to Singapore, Manila, Bangkok, New Delhi and Mumbai. In 2005 Isogawa was depicted on the 'Australian Legends' series of stamps issued by Australia Post and in 2007 he was named the country's first Fashion Laureate. A regular collaborator with choreographer Graeme Murphy, he designed costumes for The Australian Ballet's _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Murphy_, and for the Sydney Dance Company productions of _Salome_, _Air and Other Invisible Forces_, _Ellipse_ and _Grand_. Also known for his unique textiles, Isogawa's designs have appeared on collections for Designer Rugs and Woven Images. Sydney's Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences showed the retrospective _Akira Isogawa_ in 2018–2019 and his work was included in the Victoria and Albert Museum's 2020 exhibition _Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk_ in London."

Well now actually I create fashion. But back then, actually, I was consuming fashion and that's how much I loved [it].  \\nJapanese culture is so different from Western ones. My grandparents had a house next door. They were all wearing actually traditional clothes – kimono. What I noticed about kimono is actually they're made out rectangular shaped cloth. And they have no shapes. Whereas actually, Western clothes has a particular shape that enhance, particularly actually for female, the femininity of female body, but whereas actually kimono is totally unisex. I mean, I've never actually designed kimono myself. But being a kimono designer, I imagine actually, they work on texture, colour, print, and so on, because it's a highly textile driven fashion, and then to me, that's what Japanese fashion is all about. You know, when I design my own collection, I never really force myself to express my Japanese entity, but I feel that it just comes up naturally. And I think what's interesting is that not just, you know, designing something so traditionally Japanese, but then I kind of actually manage to fuse with Australian ease I guess actually. Australia has got this particular attitude – friendly to start with – but it's quite actually casual about things, you know. I feel actually my design is a result of actually, you know, some Japanese heritage with Australian attitude, which is actually friendly and easy.",

                    "content": "Carol Jerrems (1949–1980) was a photographer known for her intimate portraits of friends, lovers and others occupying the progressive social and creative circles in which she moved. Jerrems grew up in suburban Melbourne and studied art and design under Paul Cox at the Prahran Technical School between 1967 and 1970. Having won a number of awards for her photographs, including an Institute of Australian Photographers Award in 1970, Jerrems trained as a teacher and worked at technical colleges in Melbourne and, later, Hobart. She began exhibiting in the early 1970s at venues such as Brummels Gallery, Melbourne; the National Gallery of Victoria; the Arts Council Gallery, Sydney; and, later, the Australian Centre for Photography. Works such as _Vale Street_ (1975) are considered emblematic of 1970s counter-culture in Australia, not only for their documentation of people involved in spheres such as activism and creativity but specifically for their evocation of the spirit and aspirations that informed the lives and pursuits of her sitters. During the 1970s, Jerrems also completed commissions for clients such as Macquarie University; was awarded grants by the Australia Council and the Australian Film Commission; and worked for a period as a yoga instructor at an ashram north of Sydney. In 1979, Jerrems became ill with Budd Chiari Syndrome, a rare liver disease, and spent several months in hospital in Hobart undergoing treatment. She died in Melbourne in February 1980, a few weeks short of her 31st birthday. The National Gallery of Australia held touring exhibitions _Living in the 70s: Photographs by Carol Jerrems_ in 1990–1991 and _Carol Jerrems: Photographic Artist_ in 2013–2014. Heide Museum of Modern Art staged _Up Close: Carol Jerrems with Larry Clark, Nan Goldin and William Yang_ in 2010."

After returning to China and living for a time in Shanghai, she moved to Bombay early in the war. There, she became the editor of the Onlooker, a monthly glossy magazine. In this capacity she moved in political and artistic circles, meeting Nehru, Gandhi and Tata. She married David Johnston-Bell, who was serving with Lord Mountbatten in Combined Operations; they became friends with the Langhammers, and collected works by the artists in the Progressive School. After moving to Australia in 1950 the Johnston-Bells bought a number of magazines, including The Australian Collector, which under Andree's editorship, and with a range of distinguished contributors, soon became something of a collector's item in itself. One of her triumphs was the publication of previously-unseen engravings of botanical specimens collected by Banks and Solander. Upon retirement, she worked as a volunteer at the State Library of New South Wales, translating 17th century French manuscripts."

In 1972 she became the first woman presenter on _Four Corners_ – an appointment which made headlines and prompted offensive, patronising commentary on matters including her looks, marital status, and tastes in interior decoration. She remained with _Four Corners_ for nine years during which she was also a presenter on ABC radio's _City Extra_. From 1987 to 1994 she presented _The Search for Meaning_ on Radio National, conducting many of the insightful and tactful interviews for which she became renowned, and which resulted in the publication of four volumes of transcripts. For twenty years from 1996 she presented the weekly biographical television show _Australian Story_. A foundation member of the Australia Council for the Arts, she was a Reconciliation Ambassador for the Aboriginal Council for Reconciliation from 1998. Her book _An Authentic Life: Finding Meaning and Spirituality in Everyday Life_ (1998) was an Australian bestseller; and in 2009 she published _Through a Glass Darkly_, a powerful chronicle of her experience of the death of her father. She was a patron of the national mentoring and networking initiative, Women in Media, and many prominent Australian female journalists cite Jones as a role model and inspiration. Jones was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1988, won the Walkley Award for Outstanding Contribution to Journalism in 2013, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Sydney in 2017."

Born in the Northern Territory and raised in Brisbane, she was only fifteen when she won two silver medals at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, becoming one of Australia's youngest ever Olympic medallists. Having given up school to focus on swimming, she collected silver and gold medals at the world championships in Fukuoka, Japan in 2001. She won her first Olympic gold medal in Athens in 2004, and won the first of her eventual seven world titles at the world championships in Montreal in 2005. Named Female Swimmer of the Year for 2005 and World Swimmer of the Year for 2005 and 2006, Jones won three gold medals at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and two gold medals at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. After competing at the 2012 London Olympics, she announced her retirement from international swimming. Though illustrious, Jones' career was not without setbacks. In her 2015 memoir _Body Lengths_, she candidly discussed her history of anxiety, depression and her experience of the bullying and humiliation often endured by female swimmers around issues of weight and body image. Consequently, Jones has been an ambassador for Beyond Blue and was one of the faces of Swimming Queensland's 'Growing Up In Lycra' campaign. Jones was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2015."

In 1990, when she was photographed by Michael Riley for his series _Portraits by a Window_, she was a dancer with the Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre, established in 1975 and a central part of the vibrant Aboriginal arts community in the inner west. She was also a model with Lee Madden's Promotions and Model Agency in Redfern, which promoted Aboriginal models on catwalks internationally. Following this she studied community development and worked in national Indigenous health advocacy programs, including a liaison position between the National Immunisation Committee and service providers offering immunisation programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Her Master of Philosophy from the University of Sydney involved an evaluation of immunisation activities provided by Aboriginal Medical Services and their reporting procedures to the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register."

After training as a tailor in Vienna, at twenty Kahan moved to Paris, where he worked for the couturier Paul Poiret, first as a tailor and then a designer. In 1939, he enlisted in the Foreign Legion; as the war progressed he worked for the American Red Cross, making thousands of glamorous portraits of wounded servicemen in French and American hospitals in North Africa. After the war he returned to Paris and worked as an illustrator for Le Figaro, but in 1947 he came to Australia. He settled in Melbourne in 1950. Soon after he arrived the editor of Meanjin, Clem Christesen, asked him to make a series of pen and ink portraits of writers for the journal. Critic Robert Nelson wrote that these portraits 'stand tall in the great tradition of intellectual homage: direct, well observed, economical, even brusque'. Over the next fifty years his pen and ink portraits were hung in many Melbourne homes, while he continued to experiment with techniques and fields of activity. The Jewish Museum held a Kahan retrospective in 1997, comprising portraits, stained glass, drawings, paintings, prints, costume and set designs and ephemera. A selection of his war drawings was shown at the Australian Embassy in Washington in 2005. Kahan won the Archibald Prize in 1962 with a startling portrait of Patrick White."

Quite generally speaking, my works in oil are based on sketches – vaguely based on sketches – and come to life only while I’m in the process of execution. One must always leave – I at least must always leave – a certain element of ambiguity which appears in the work in mental process while you’re at work. I love working from life, life drawings – I do quite a number, and my life drawings very often don’t have any close relationship to the work I’m doing based on those drawings. My subject matter is a very varied one, for the very reason that I consider art an adventure and any path I have trodden before seems to me very often used up, and I need to find a different stimulus and a different subject or combination of ideas.\\n\\nThe actual painting of a picture doesn’t take long. Very often I may only spend an hour a day in actual execution of a painting; most of the time is spent just thinking about it, looking at the work, the stage in which the work is, and so drift, think and let things develop in my mind.",

At nineteen he moved to Edinburgh to continue his trade, joining the corporation of barber-surgeons. Around the same time he began producing caricatures of Edinburgh notables and identities, exhibiting his work in his barber shop until 1785, when an annuity from a patron enabled him give up barbering altogether and work as an artist full-time. Completely self-taught, Kay engraved almost 900 plates between 1784 and 1822, and also produced many portrait miniatures. He sold his work from the print shop he established in Parliament Close in 1785, many of his caricatured portraits allegedly being purchased by their subjects just so that they could then destroy them. In 1837–38, some years after his death, Kay’s prints were published in two volumes as A series of original portraits and caricature etchings by the late John Kay … with biographical sketches and illustrated anecdotes, with further editions appearing in 1842 and 1877. Providing a quirky, alternative record of Edinburgh in its golden age, Kay’s caricatures are represented in collections such as those of the National Library of Australia, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and the National Portrait Gallery, London, which holds nearly 300 examples of his work."

She met Horace Keats in Sydney, and after hearing her sing at the New Zealand Soldiers Rest Room, he determined to make her his wife. They were married in 1918, and were to live at various addresses in Mosman throughout their lives together. Always addressed as 'Mrs Keats' by their friends, under the name of Barbara Russell she became the principal performer of his songs; he described her as his critic and guide. In 1946, the year after Keats died, Janet married the poet Hugh McRae; their marriage was dissolved two years later."

Having been persuaded to remain in the country to accompany Australian singers Ella Caspers and Peter Dawson, between 1917 and 1920 he was orchestral pianist and conductor for several operas directed by Count Filippini, and for three years from 1920 he led a trio in the restaurant of Farmer's department store. Soon after, he became involved in the formation of the ABC. During the 1920s he and his wife, soprano Janet le Brun Brown, began their long broadcasting careers; except for a short break in 1930 when he returned to England to work for the BBC as a conductor, he was associated with the ABC until he died. From 1933, when Keats began composing in earnest, he wrote more than 120 pieces. In 1934 he began setting the work of Australian poets to music. In 1936 he commenced a series of settings of Christopher Brennan's poems, to which he had been granted exclusive rights during his lifetime. These came to be regarded as some of his finest compositions. Amongst his other productions are some film scores."

In Melbourne, he and his pub band The Dots made two albums before breaking up in 1982. He recorded _Post_ in Sydney in 1985, but his major break came the following year, by which time his band was known as The Coloured Girls. Their double album _Gossip_ was one of the biggest Australian records of 1986. The band made _Under the Sun_ (1987) before touring the US as Paul Kelly and the Messengers. They disbanded in 1991, and from that point Kelly branched into producing and acting as well as writing and performing. Kelly sings with a marked Australian accent and many of his songs refer to specific Australian people, places and experiences.\\n\\nThough he has written most of his long and poetic songlist alone, over the course of his 27 studio albums has also collaborated brilliantly, particularly with First Nations performers such as Kev Carmody, Christine Anu and Yothu Yindi. His self-described 'mongrel memoir', _How to Make Gravy_, was released in 2010 and Ian Darling's film _Paul Kelly: Stories of Me_ appeared in 2012. In 2013 Kelly was the subject of a biographical exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. The winner of seventeen ARIA awards, he was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1997. His 2019 greatest hits album _Songs from the South_ debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, his third number one album in three years (the others were _Life is Fine_ and _Nature_)."

He achieved his first major success with Bring Larks and Heroes (1967), a novel about the Vinegar Hill convict uprising of 1804, based on the writings of Watkin Tench. It won the Miles Franklin Award, as did his next novel, Three Cheers for the Paraclete (1968). His 1972 novel, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, won several awards and was made into a film in 1978. His 1982 Booker Prize-winning novel Schindler's Ark was filmed by Steven Spielberg as Schindler's List (1993). It has been said that Keneally's writing 'captures the texture of history'."

The first draft, at the rate of, if possible, 1000 to 1500 words a day, but that’s not always possible.\\n\\nI’m always having blackouts, losses of confidence, losses of vital energy. However, I’m convinced that the writing of a novel is not an inspirational business and can be done efficiently, and in fact must be done efficiently, by applying yourself to it every morning. I therefore attempt to write about at least 1000 words a morning. I write all morning – this is for the past two years – write all morning, go to school in the afternoon, come home, generally write again. I still am plagued by the good old Irish Catholic guilt and feel that I should work every night. But night work is usually ineffectual, disastrous, hard to settle to, not worth much when it is done. Of course, there’s no one way – I’ve found this out by questioning, asking other novelists as I do shamelessly, specially to overseas visitors – there’s no one way of writing a novel. And some people do, like myself, feel that once they’ve got that first draft done in totality, then they’ve got some chance of fixing the thing up and even adding extra material.",

I’m sure that sometimes it’s nearly as crude as wanting to express the past and wanting to exorcise it in combination with wanting to be recognised as a good expresser and exorcisor of the past.\\n\\nI think the unlikely backgrounds that most novelists have is an indication of the possibility that they have taken to writing out of an attempt to adjust their own unsatisfactory lives, a sort of breaking new ground and adjusting to some almost indigestible break or disaster or failure in their past. Well to be frank, I know this is the reason I started writing, of course, to adjust a balance in my own life, to find a place, a voice in Australia. Since I began to get even the tiniest recognition as a writer, I felt I had a stake in Australia. For years after I left the seminary, until I did start to have work published, I felt an alien in the streets of Sydney. It’s a strange, brash city and it’s a bad city to be an alien in. It’s only since I’ve started to, in particular since I got a sense of responsibility towards writing and began to see what direction Bring Larks and Heroes was travelling in and began to see that I might be expressing something of importance for Australians, that I felt a big stake in Australia, a place amongst the Australian people.",

She made her debut in London in 1975 having trained at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and at La Scala, Milan, and having won the prestigious Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship. She joined the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1976 and went on to make numerous appearances there in operas including _The Marriage of Figaro_, _The Magic Flute_, _Don Giovanni_ and _Turandot_, establishing an association with the legendary venue that continued until 1996. She has regularly performed internationally also, making her name with her interpretations of soprano roles by Handel and Mozart, and developing a repertoire encompassing everything from Monteverdi and Bach to contemporary composers such as Andre Previn. She has sung with Opera Australia since 1982, and has performed with many international companies including the Bavarian State Opera, the Opéra National de Lorraine, the English National Opera and the Vienna State Opera. A two-time ARIA winner, Kenny won the Mo Award for Operatic Performer of the Year in 1994; performed the Olympic Hymn at the Sydney 2000 closing ceremony; has recorded more than 20 albums; and was the voice of Nellie Melba for the 1987 mini-series _Melba_.

He worked in England, America and Australia as a stunt flyer and joy-flight pilot, and for West Australian Airways, before forming his own aviation company in 1924. He then embarked on a series of record flights with Ulm. The pair flew in record time around Australia, from America to Australia, from Point Cook near Melbourne to Perth, and from Sydney to Christchurch. Ulm disappeared on a flight from America to Australia, intending to demonstrate the feasibility of a commercial trans-pacific air service.

Born Ellen Wittrup Hansen in Copenhagen, she trained as a dancer in Paris, toured with various companies in South America and danced in Paris and London. A founding member of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo in 1932, four years later she toured Australia with the company as a leading dancer, turning in sparkling performances in _Petrouchka_ and _Le Carnaval_. At the end of the tour in 1937 she went back to England but returned early in 1938 to marry the Danish Vice-Consul in Sydney, Erik Fischer. In 1940 she began a ballet school in Sydney, and the following year she established the Kirsova Ballet. She employed several dancers who had stayed in Australia following the Ballets Russes tours to Australia, including Tamara Tchinarova, and took on some young Australian dancers who would later have significant careers, such as Rachel Cameron, Strelsa Heckelman, Paul Hammond and Peggy Sager. An important patron of Australian artists, composers and set designers, Kirsova commissioned designs for her original ballets from artists such as Loudon Sainthill, Amie Kingston, Alice Danciger and Wolfgang Cardamatis. The Kirsova Ballet folded in 1944, but Kirsova kept her school running until she retired to Europe in the late 1940s."

The son of a rabbi, he served an apprenticeship as a cabinetmaker and lived briefly in Berlin before emigrating to Australia in August 1939. Settling in Melbourne, he opened a workshop in St Kilda, and rapidly established a reputation for the superb construction of his custom-made modern furniture. Credited with elevating his craft to the level of an art, he was the subject of several one-man exhibitions in his lifetime and he was commissioned to provide the woodwork for the chapel of St Mary's College at the University of Melbourne. The NGV held a retrospective exhibition of his work in 1975. He is represented in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of South Australia and the Powerhouse Museum."

                    "content": "Rosalie Kunoth-Monks OAM (1937-2022), Arrernte and Anmatjere woman, Aboriginal activist, former actress and nun, was born at Artekerre soak on Utopia Cattle Station in the Northern Territory, the daughter of Allan and Ruby Kunoth. Her paternal grandfather was German, and her paternal grandmother was from Arrernte country. In 1953 Kunoth was cast by the producer Charles Chauvel in the title role of the film _Jedda_. Selected unwittingly from among local schoolgirls because she had the shy demeanour Chauvel was looking for, she was coached, cared-for and chided by Chauvel and his wife Elsa, with whom she stayed throughout the filming. At one point, she ran away but was retrieved. Because the scenes were filmed out of sequence she never knew the story until _Jedda_ was released in 1955; it previewed at the Star Theatre, a segregated cinema in Darwin, but Kunoth given special dispensation to sit with the white audience. Both Kunoth and her mother were dismayed by the sexualised nature of Kunoth's role, which breached their customs. Further, the publicity booklet for the film, Eve in Ebony … the story of 'Jedda', stated falsely that Ngarla was her tribal name as a child. Kunoth was dismayed, as Ngarla was her mother's skin totem: 'And every part of my body screamed and said, \"I am not a Ngarla, I am an Apunaga woman\", because I'd been brought up knowing who I am, and for a white person to change my skin was more than I could take', she said in her 1995 interview for the Australian Biography series.\\n\\nKunoth left Alice Springs in 1957 and joined an Anglican order of nuns in Melbourne. Ten years later, with the blessing of the church, she left in order to work directly with Aboriginal people. She was employed at the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and set up the first Aboriginal family group home in Victoria at Essendon. After returning to the Northern Territory with her husband Bill Monks, she became involved in politics, social work and environmental causes, and was appointed adviser to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Paul Everingham. In 1979, she sought election to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, in order to fight the proposed construction of a dam which threatened sacred land. Although not elected, she continued to oppose the dam, for which plans were abandoned in 1992. In 2008, she moved back to her Utopia homelands and was a spokesperson for Amnesty International in Canberra, censuring Federal Government intervention in the Territory as a violation of human rights. She was named Northern Territory Australian of the Year in 2015."

Two years later he was appointed superintendent of the Port Phillip District, answerable to the governor of New South Wales, George Gipps. La Trobe had some difficulty handling a disparate collection of separatist free settlers who resented control from Sydney, and was attacked in the Town Council and the Argus as the 1840s wore on. However, he gained popularity in 1849 for forwarding a cargo of convicts to Sydney in defiance of the Colonial Office. In 1850, when Victoria became a colony, La Trobe was appointed its lieutenant-governor. Gold was discovered the following year, and his new government had immediately to rise to the nightmarish administrative challenge of the gold rush. La Trobe left Victoria in 1854, having established the Melbourne Botanic Gardens and having provided key support for the foundation of several important public health and cultural institutions, including the hospital and the university."

He lived on his uncle's north-west NSW farm, working as a jackeroo and becoming friendly with Breaker Morant and Banjo Paterson before coming to Sydney to work as an illustrator for the _Bulletin_. He studied at the Julian Ashton Art School in Sydney from 1896 to 1900, when winning the first NSW Travelling scholarship enabled him to spend a year in Paris. He was successful both there and in London, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy and the New Salon and gained a reputation as a raconteur and man about town. During the First World War, as the only official war artist to be appointed to the rank of Honorary Captain, he produced immense, violent paintings of the landing at Gallipoli and the charge of the Light Horse at Beersheba. When he returned to Sydney in 1921 he was the most glittering figure of the art world, and between 1920 and 1930 his paintings dominated the Australian art scene. At the same time, he encouraged a new generation of modernist artists such as Thea Proctor, Roy de Maistre, Roland Wakelin and Grace Cossington Smith. Toward the end of his life, with his pupil Arthur Murch, he created the figure of the unknown soldier in St Mary's Basilica, Sydney. For Sydney's Domain he also made the statue of another old acquaintance, Henry Lawson, a work, like his war paintings, that has significantly influenced notions of Australian identity. He won the Wynne Prize in 1899, the Archibald Prize in 1927, and was an Associate of the Royal Academy."

An art student at the time Oskar Kokoschka was teaching at the Viennese Academy, Langhammer had made friends with an Indian student, Shirin Vimadalal, who subsequently returned to India. After he wrote to her, she managed to persuade Sir Francis Low, editor of the Times of India, to appoint Langhammer first art director of the paper in about 1936. Adapting enthusiastically to his new home, Langhammer set up open house at his studio on Nepean Sea Road, and the young Indian artists who were to develop into the great names of the Indian Progressive Art movement would meet there on Sundays to hear his tales of the European art scene. Exhibiting regularly himself at the Bombay Art Society, Langhammer was soon surrounded by an 'in crowd' of fellow European Jewish refugees - professionals, artists, doctors and industrialists - who became important art patrons and accelerated the Progressive movement. Kekoo Gandhy, who was to found the long-running Chemould gallery of modern art in Bombay, recalls Langhammer's confidence that 'contemporary Indian art would make a mark and have an impact on the art scene . . . [He compared] it in terms of impact to the French Impressionist movement . . . referring to various schools - the Bengal school, miniature paintings, the influence of Indian sculpture. India had a great store of inspiration to draw from and the colours and light of India would make the difference.' Langhammer returned 'heartbroken' to Europe in the early 1960s, when his health deteriorated."

After travelling and studying informally in Algiers and North Africa, in 1962 he came to Australia with his wife and children to take up a position as a teacher. Over the 1960s he produced an important body of work exploring social and political themes, often incorporating brightly coloured painted heads of celebrities, sex symbols, dictators, politicians and porn stars in challenging juxtaposition. Seemingly distinct from these works are geometric, ethereal and glittery abstract paintings - indeed for a decade from the 1980s Larter chose only to exhibit abstractions - but elements of these works also fill the backgrounds of the figurative paintings. Working to a rigorous, disciplined routine, Larter has been prolific and his work is held by the National Gallery of Australia and all State Galleries. A major exhibition of his figurative work, _Stripperama_, was held at the Heide Museum of Modern Art in 2002, and the National Gallery of Australia presented a comprehensive overview exhibition _Richard Larter: a retrospective_, with accompanying scholarly catalogue, in late 2008."

But I found that when I wanted to draw the body, the drawing deteriorated in quality the further away from the head you got. So I decided that I would draw nudes and improve my technique.\\n\\nI started drawing nudes, using my wife as a model. At this time I was painting abstract pictures, I was virtually doing sort of a private record of my wife – well she was 17 when I married her and you get sort of gradual change from girlhood to womanhood, sort of thing – and I was sort of creating this private record. After a while I became quite good at this and I thought, well I can use this in my paintings.\\n\\nI find that I’ll draw anybody in the nude if they’ll pose, sort of thing. I enjoy drawing nudes. Then there’s the perverse side of it – I know that they upset people, they upset my mother and she was the first person to be upset. Then as I started to exhibit and send pictures away, people started writing things and saying things about the nudes. I think this made me a little more daring, so instead of being discreet nudes they became very indiscreet nudes. I suppose you say, a Larter nude, you expect to see all the main sexual characteristics. Well fair enough, give a dog a bad name and he’ll live up to it. I’ve certainly done this, I’ve made it more and more and more obvious, I suppose. But I have such strange people asking me … I can remember being at an opening where a funny little solicitor was introduced to me and his whole idea of talking to me was that he thought that if he kept with me long enough eventually we’d get to the girls and he’d have a fine time. I suppose this does sort of produce this sort of reaction in some people. But to me this isn’t the point of doing the work.",

He began work as a physics lecturer at the University of Melbourne in 1943, and made his first trip to the Antarctic with the 1947–1948 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition, as Senior Scientific Officer. He went on to participate in many exploratory voyages and oversaw the establishment of the Australian Antarctic Division’s research stations – Mawson, Casey and Davis. He was Director of the Antarctic Division of the Department of External Affairs from 1949 to 1966; during that period, he and his colleagues mapped more than 3000 miles of coastline and some 800 000 square miles of territory. Law's wife, Nel, was the first Australian woman to visit Antarctica. President of the Royal Society of Victoria from 1967 to 1969, Law was active for many years in tertiary education, marine science and public life, and authored several books about his Antarctic investigations and adventures. His honours include the Royal Geographical Society's Founders Medal, former recipients of which include Douglas Mawson and Jane Franklin. Law died at age 97; his ashes, and Nel's, were later interred near Mawson Station."

She began her performance career as a dancer at the Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre, later performing with the Bangarra Dance Theatre. In 1990, she made her acting debut in the musical _Bran Nue Dae_; she appeared in the film version in 2009. Her 1994 one-woman show _Ningali_ toured internationally in 1995 and won the Fringe First Award for best new production at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe that year. Lawford-Wolf performed in stage productions for Belvoir Street Theatre, the Black Swan State Theatre Company and the Sydney Theatre Company. Her film career included starring roles in _Rabbit-Proof Fence_ (2002) and _Last Cab to Darwin_ (2015), for which she was nominated for the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She also appeared in ABC television's _Mystery Road_ (2018). Off screen Lawford-Wolf was involved in community work in Fitzroy Crossing, advocating on issues relating to education and employment for traditional owners and becoming a director of the Indigenous-owned Kimberley Agricultural and Pastoral Company. In 2019, Lawford-Wolf tragically died while on tour with the Sydney Theatre Company's acclaimed adaptation of Kate Grenville's _The Secret River_, a production she helped to create. A cultural consultant and artistic collaborator with Bangarra Dance Theatre, Lawford-Wolf's legacy was honoured in their 2021 production _SandSong_, created in consultation with Wangkatjunga/Walmajarri Elders from the Kimberley and Great Sandy Desert regions."

And I wanted to write a theatre that was different, had all different forms of acting in it whether it be music, dance, singing, a monologue. And I wanted to stay in the traditional way of storytelling but make it real, make it different. And the only way, and the only way I can do stories like that was to fall back on myself and my plays, like ‘You know, you’ve got a story yourself, you’ve been to Alaska when you were 16, you know, you lived here, you lived there, you’ve come from Christmas Creek station, you’ve come up from nowhere and make a name for yourself in the acting world and that is an achievement for someone my age. And I never really thought about it because I don’t think I’m anything special. I don’t know, I’m still quite naive in that aspect.\\n\\nI wanted to make it honest too, ‘cos you look at a lot of Aboriginal people that are working out there, there’s a lot of Aboriginal women that are working but not really strong Aboriginal women’s stories. And I wanted to make my point of view as a woman and as a proud Aboriginal woman, proud of where I come from, whether than be the backblocks of Woop Woop but yet that place still has a very big significance for me. I wanted to make Australia realise that they do have an Indigenous culture in Australia. They have it here. No, no, and Australia doesn’t need to go anywhere else and adopt someone else’s Indigenous culture which a lot of people tend to do. But, you know, they have it here. And nobody hasn’t discovered it, it’s so funny going to Europe, for me, and more European people know more about Aboriginal Australia than Australians do so which is quite sad, which is really really quite sad. It goes to show how ignorant white Australia is.",

                    "content": "Kerrie Lester (1953–2016) became well-known as a portraitist for her playful, textured, highly coloured works that appeared regularly in the Archibald and Portia Geach exhibitions of the late 1980s and the 1990s. Born in Sydney, Lester studied at the National Art School and the Alexander Mackie College between 1971 and 1975. She held her first solo exhibition in 1976 and featured regularly in group exhibitions including the Wynne and Sulman prizes and the Mosman Art Prize, which she won in 2011. Her bold and distinctive portraits, in which the outlines of the sitters are hand-stitched, were contenders for the Archibald Prize at least sixteen times and, from 1988 until her death in 2016, she figured in the Portia Geach Memorial Award shortlist nine times, her sitters including Phillip Noyce, Judy Cassab, Jeffrey Smart, Akira Isogawa, Jimmy Barnes, Margaret Fink and Trent Nathan. Her _Self-portrait as a Bridesmaid_ took out the Archibald's Packing Room Prize in 1998. Lester’s painting of athlete Cathy Freeman was among the first 50 works acquired for the National Portrait Gallery's collection. Art historian Gavin Fry has suggested that 'the appeal of Kerrie Lester's work lies in the way it embodies both the serious and the whimsical, the fleeting and the solid, the wry smile with instant recognition of our own weaknesses and excesses'."

I don’t use pencil or crayons very often, I like to use a brush with a very thin medium, and I draw it in onto the canvas and then I do a lot of blocking in, and then I like to have my sitter back when I’ve done all the preparing, and then paint with my sitter present.\\n\\nSometimes, of course, I come into very difficult problems because my models haven’t got as much time as they – as I – would need and I try and do as much without them from memory and occasionally have to have a photo taken, and try and do a little from that. But I don’t think you can ever get the colour and the feeling trying to ever paint from a photograph. You must have the live person there and you get some inspiration from them as you’re working, I think on portraiture anyway.\\n\\nI like to have my portraits with a feeling that they are casual and not in every detail, because sometimes I think I feel as if they’re overworked and have a very tight feeling about them. I like the loose flowing feelings and a little bit of softness and a little bit of imagination left to it.",

In 1921 the family moved to Melbourne, where they were to operate the Lindrum billiard hall for decades. Walter and his brother were coached by their father, Frederick, who, according to Walter, was the best billiard player in the pre-World War 1 world. Walter’s brother Frederick, too, was brilliant at the game, but fate saw Walter emerge as the dominant player internationally. In 1929 he went to England, where he quickly established himself as the greatest the world had seen. He made his largest competitive break, of 4 137, in 1932. The 1930s were his peak years; he won the world billiards championship in 1933 and retained the title throughout the decade. In the 1940s, he abandoned competitive play. Apart from writing about billiards, in his later years he applied himself to raising funds for Melbourne charities. His much-visited grave in Melbourne General Cemetery is in the form of a billiards tabletop, complete with cue and balls."

Australia's first Aboriginal pop star, Little made his recording debut in 1956. After a national number one hit, 'Royal Telephone', which sold over 75,000 copies, he became a household name and was named Pop Star of the Year in 1964. His profile continued to grow through TV appearances, radio airplay and regular tours around Australia. In the 1980s, Little began working at the Eora Centre in Redfern, becoming a role model and mentor for Indigenous youth, and from 2000 was a guest lecturer at the University of Sydney’s Koori Centre. In a characteristically low-key resurgence, he won the Mo award in 1997 and in 1999 his album _Messenger_ – featuring covers of songs by The Cruel Sea, Nick Cave, Paul Kelly and The Church – won an ARIA Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album. The same year, he was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and was named Best Male Artist at the Deadly Awards. In 2004 he was named a Living National Treasure, received the Australia Council's Red Ochre Award, two honorary doctorates and won the Classic Rock Performer Mo Award following the release of his 34th album, _Life's what you make it_. He founded the Jimmy Little Foundation in 2006 to improve renal health across Indigenous communities in regional and remote Australia. Little won a Golden Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival in 2011."

After working for four years as a photographer in New Zealand and Australia, in 1980 he moved to Singapore to become the managing director of the Apa Photo Agency. He formed his own company, R Ian Lloyd Productions, in 1983 and has since photographed thirty-six books about Asia and Australia. His photographs have appeared in National Geographic, Time, Fortune, Gourmet and Conde Nast Traveler and he has carried out commercial assignments for companies including ExxonMobil, Pepsi, Motorola and Singapore Airlines. In 2000 a twenty-year retrospective of his photography sponsored by the National Geographic Channel, Kodak and Canon toured six Asian cities. Two years later he initiated the STUDIO project, which gave rise to the book STUDIO: Australian Painters on the Nature of Creativity with text by John McDonald, art critic for the Sydney Morning Herald. In preparation for the book and associated exhibition, Lloyd and McDonald photographed and interviewed leading artists throughout Australia. The resulting show comprised sixty-one large portraits of painters working in their studios, representing a broad cross-section of men and women working in a variety of styles across the country."

                    "content": "Sir Charles Lloyd Jones (1878-1958), merchant and arts patron, grew up in Sydney, where he studied at Julian Ashton's art school in 1895. Showing little promise as an artist, he qualified as a tailor and cutter in London before marrying. His grandfather was David Jones, and he began work in the David Jones clothing factory in 1902. By 1905, he was the store's advertising manager; he became a director in 1906, when David Jones Limited became a public company, and was to be its chairman from 1920 to 1958, as the store expanded in Sydney and then across the country. Amongst his many other public positions was the first chairmanship of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, in 1932. Together with Sydney Ure Smith and Bertram Stevens, he founded _Art in Australia_ and _The Home_. He was a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales for twenty-four years and established the David Jones' Art Gallery. He persisted with his own painting, and exhibited often with the Society of Artists, of which he was treasurer from time to time; he is represented in the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the National Gallery of Victoria. At the same time, he built up a very significant collection of paintings by other artists. He lived at Rosemount in Ocean Street, Woollahra, was a member of several clubs and was commodore of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron from 1949 to 1955; his close friend, Sir Robert Menzies, gave his funeral oration."

                    "content": "David Lloyd Jones (1931–1961) was the great-grandson of the original David Jones – who founded the eponymous department store in Sydney in 1838 – and the eldest son of Sir Charles Lloyd Jones (1878–1958), who was chairman of David Jones Ltd from 1920 until his death. Educated at Cranbrook School, David L Jones (as he called himself) was seventeen when his father began preparing him as his successor. David was sent to work in David Jones' London office and to learn about textiles in Manchester before spending some time as a salesman in the toy department at Harrods. He then undertook a year-long executive training course at Macy's in New York. He is said to have acquired a taste for modern art while he was there. Returning to Sydney in 1951, he was put in charge of the first floor of David Jones' flagship Elizabeth Street premises and subsequently became manager of it, and of the stores in Perth and Wagga Wagga. He married Rosemary Turnbull in 1953; in 1954, aged 23, he became the youngest director of David Jones in the firm's history. A profile which appeared in the _Australian Women's Weekly_ in January 1957 noted that he usually took the tram to work from his terrace house in Woollahra, and that his salary 'has always erred on the meagre side' because that was the way he wanted it. 'A tireless worker', he was said to be at work each day well before opening time, and was 'still there at night when the doors are closed after the last of the customers have scurried from the store.'\\n\\nA councilor of the Retail Traders Association, he became an alderman of the City of Sydney in 1956, representing the Civic Reform Association. He was also a member of the Board of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, the Sydney Chamber of Commerce and the Swedish Chamber of Commerce, and was a founding member of the council of the Art Gallery Society of New South Wales. He became Deputy Chairman and joint Managing Director of David Jones Ltd following his father's death in 1958; in 1960, he was appointed Chairman. Hailed as Australia's most successful young businessman, at the time of his death, aged 30, in June 1931, David Jones employed more than 8000 people and had an annual turnover of thirty-nine million pounds."

                    "content": "Sir John Longstaff, born in Clunes, Victoria, studied at the NGV school from 1883 to 1887 and thenceforth at Corman's in Paris. Becoming friends with the Australian expatriate impressionist John Russell, he met Toulouse-Lautrec and others, but his own style remained conservative and he exhibited at the Salon and the RA in the early 1890s. 'Tall, handsome and charming', according to his biographer Leigh Astbury, 'Longstaff moved effortlessly in society circles where his skills as a portraitist were eagerly sought'. Indeed, his sitters included King Edward and Queen Alexandra. In London in 1907 he completed his colossal Arrival of Burke, Wills and King at the deserted camp at Cooper's Creek, Sunday evening, 21st April 1861, now in the collection of the NGV. During World War I he painted many portraits of leading Australian military figures (his cousin, Will Longstaff, painted some of the iconic paintings of the Australian War Memorial, as well as the portrait of Walter Lindrum now owned by the National Portrait Gallery). John Longstaff's 1923 painting of Nellie Melba was presented to the NGV from Melba's estate in 1932. John Longstaff won the Archibald Prize five times between 1925 and 1935; during this period, in 1928, he was knighted. From 1927 until his death in Melbourne in 1941 he was a trustee of the NGV."

Her delicate, yet disturbing paintings are characteristically made using an airbrush and a restricted palette of soft, pastel colours. In 2008, she won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize for a self-portrait in the Belanglo State Forest, the site of a series of murders in the mid-1990s. In 2010 her work was included in Wilderness: Balnaves contemporary: painting at the Art Gallery of NSW. She was a finalist in the 2011 Archibald Prize with a portrait of artist Tim Silver and in 2012 she had works in the Wynne and Sulman Prizes.

                    "content": "Bea Maddock AM (1934–2016) studied at the Hobart Technical College in the early 1950s before travelling to London, where she attended the Slade School from 1959 to 1961. From the time of her return to Australia, she taught: at the Launceston Teachers’ College, the Launceston Technical College, the National Gallery of Victoria school, the Victorian College of the Arts and the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. In 1979–1980 she made a large wax-coated collage of embossed hand-made paper words on commission for the new High Court in Canberra. In February 1983 her home and studio at Mount Macedon were razed in the Ash Wednesday fires. She returned to Launceston where she was head of the school of art at the College of Advanced Education for two years. Between 1964 and 2006, she held more than forty solo exhibitions and her work was included in more than seventy Australian and international group shows. In 1986 she held the Creative Arts Fellowship at the Australian National University; the following year she went to Antarctica, the trip giving rise to panoramic views of the territory. Metaphysical enquiry, dread and loneliness were often evoked in her introspective self-portraits; the exhibition _Being and Nothingness_ toured state galleries and the National Gallery of Australia in 1992–1993. In 1993 she was the winner of the Clemenger Award for Contemporary Art. From 1993 to 1998 she worked on _Terra Spiritus: With a Darker Shade of Pale_, a monumental 52-sheet panorama of the entire coastline of Tasmania made from ochre pigment she sourced and ground herself. Informed by her identification with Aboriginal spirituality, the work featured placenames in local Indigenous languages in refutation of the colonial notion of _terra nullius_ – uninhabited land. \\n\\nMaddock’s work was the subject of survey exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in 2002 and is held in the collections of most major Australian galleries."

As non-Indigenous people arrived and remained in the area he became an important negotiator between the newcomers and the Yolngu. During the 1950s, he encouraged the commercial production of bark paintings at the mission, hoping to promote understanding of Yolgnu spiritual beliefs and traditions. In the late 1940s, he contributed to a set of 365 crayon drawings made for anthropologists Ronald and Catherine Berndt, and painted large bark works for the Art Gallery of New South Wales. He contributed to the Yirrkala church panels, and was instrumental in sending the bark petition to Canberra that has since become a key document in the history of Aboriginal land rights legislation. He was one of the first Indigenous artists to teach his daughters (Banduk and Dhuwarrwarr) to paint; his son, Wandjuk Djuwakan Marika OBE (1927-1987), was chair of the Aboriginal Arts Board from 1975 to 1980 and a highly influential Indigenous spokesperson and artist of the 1960s and 1970s."

She was a Fellow at the ANU until 2007, and became the Adjunct Professor at the Fenner School of Environment and Society in 2008. A passionate environmentalist, much of Martin's work was motivated by the 'urgency to address the major issues of land use and exploitation in Australia'. She painted in the landscape, bringing crates of canvases or sketchbooks with her in order to develop an intimate connection with the land, and raised awareness of environmental issues through her projects in regional and remote Australia. Martin held over 100 solo exhibitions during her career, and her paintings are held in many public and private collections."

Ltd. Paquita attended school in Broken Hill and Adelaide before studying piano and singing at the Elder Conservatorium of Music. She was seventeen when she met Douglas Mawson, shortly after his return from Ernest Shackleton's British Antarctic Expedition. They were engaged within a year, Paquita accepting that she would have to wait until the end of Mawson's next venture, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, before their wedding could take place. They married in Melbourne, a month after Mawson's return from Antarctica, in March 1914. Their first of their two daughters, Patricia, was born in 1915; she remained in Australia when Paquita went to England to assist Mawson in his wartime role with the Ministry of Munitions. Their second child, Jessica, was born in London in 1917. After the war, the family settled in Adelaide, where Paquita worked for the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association, including nine years as president, and the Australian Red Cross Society. Notable for her community work, Paquita was equally prominent in Adelaide's social and cultural life. Appointed an officer of the Order of Oranje-Nassau in 1946 for her work with Dutch refugees during the Second World War, she was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1951. She also wrote two books – the first a biography of her father, _A Vision of Steel_ (1958), and the second a biography of her husband, _Mawson of the Antarctic_ (1964)."

On her return to Brisbane, Mayo worked tirelessly to promote appreciation of the arts, including co-founding the Queensland Art Fund. She became the first woman trustee of the Queensland Art Gallery in 1960. Mayo’s remarkably diverse works include the Brisbane City Hall tympanum and Concert Hall medallions, and the bronze entrance doors of the Mitchell Wing of the State Library of New South Wales.

Having weathered harassment from both schoolmates and teachers for his love of dance, at seventeen he left for Melbourne and further training at the Australian Ballet School. He joined the Australian Ballet in 1983, won bronze at the Fifth International Ballet Competition in Moscow in 1985, and was promoted to principal artist with the company in 1989. Working under successive artistic directors Maina Gielgud and Ross Stretton, McAllister's major roles included those in _Onegin_, _Romeo and Juliet_, _La Fille mal gardee_, _Don Quixote_, _The Sentimental Bloke_, _Coppelia_, _Manon_, _La Sylphide_, _Sinfonietta_ and _Stepping Stones_. As a guest artist he has danced with the Bolshoi Ballet, the Kirov Ballet, the National Ballet of Canada, the Birmingham Royal Ballet and the Singapore Dance Theatre, among other companies. After making his final appearance as dancer in _Giselle_ in 2001 he became the Australian Ballet's artistic director shortly afterwards. During twenty years in this role, McAllister helped to transform the company into one of the best dance companies in the world. In his 2020 memoir _Soar: A Life Freed by Dance_ he writes that highlights of his tenure include choreographing a new production of _Sleeping Beauty_ (2015), commissioning new works, supporting local choreographers and introducing a maternity leave policy and a health and wellness team. Since retiring in 2020, he has choreographed a new _Swan Lake_ (2021) for the Finnish National Ballet."

And whenever there was a family gathering, I was always putting on a show and annoying the hell out of everyone. So, I guess it was in my DNA and I didn't really have a plan B. I’d started training when I was seven. I didn't realize that all the other boys at school wouldn't think it was quite as cool as what I did. So, that was, a life journey. But yeah, I just love to dance. And I guess ballet, because I saw some ballet on TV, which was Rudolf Nureyev doing Don Quixote with the Australian Ballet. And I went, Oh, that's the sort of dance I want to do. And then I went to a ballet school and 10 years later I was in Melbourne at the Australian Ballet School. And two years later I joined the company.\\n\\nI've got to say the first time I saw that portrait, I was just in awe really. I'd seen all of the preparatory work that Peter had done through his journals and diaries and things, and he talked a lot about it. So, I guess I knew that the dance element would be as it was, and it was incredibly beautiful. But I had no idea of what I'd look like. And it was really, really amazing. He caught a moment that sort of not, I guess what people would think necessarily is a former dancer and, a, you know, artistic director, because we tend to be on, you know, sort of like ‘Welcome to the ballet’. And it was sort of more of a pensive moment. And I really liked that ’cos, you know, I feel like it's the side of me that sometimes people don't get to see. And so it's beautiful that it's the side that he's shown.",

After leaving school he began work in a small advertising agency, where his growing interest in photography was encouraged. In 1963 he moved to Sydney, where he began freelancing for magazines including the _Bulletin_, _Vogue Australia_ and _Walkabout_. McFarlane's 1964 photograph of Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins on a Sydney bus is one of his most recognisable images. At the same time, as editor of the magazine _Camera World_, he began his lifelong career writing about photography. In the early 1970s he travelled and worked overseas. Since 1973 he has documented Australian society and key figures in politics and the performing arts, taking stills photographs on a great number of significant Australian films and theatre productions. He has exhibited in solo and group shows and has written regular photography criticism for the _Australian_ and the _Sydney Morning Herald_. His work is represented in the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of NSW and the National Library as well as the National Portrait Gallery."

In 1912 he travelled around Europe and the UK, and his landscapes were exhibited at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters in London in 1913. Back in Melbourne he held successful exhibitions and taught drawing at the National Gallery School from 1916 to 1934. Beginning in 1921, McInnes won the Archibald Prize seven times, writing in defence of his conservative work that 'in Australia we have not been bitten by Cubism or Futurism or other isms … and I am glad of it'. Sir William Dargie was the only artist to win more times than McInnes; Dargie employed a style similar to McInnes, of optical realism based on tonal values, which had been handed down from Bernard Hall, McInnes' teacher, via Max Meldrum to Archibald Colquhoun, Dargie's teacher. In 1927 McInnes was commissioned, with Septimus Power, to paint the opening of Federal Parliament by HRH the Duke of York. He went to London in 1933 to paint the Duke's portrait. The following year he acted as director of the National Gallery of Victoria, and became Head of the National Gallery School, a position he held until shortly before his death."

                    "content": "Rod McNicol (b. 1946), photographic artist, studied photography at Prahran College in Melbourne, where he formed a close friendship with Athol Shmith. A co-founder, in 1975, of the Photographers Gallery, McNicol held his first exhibition, with Carol Jerrems, in 1978 at Brummels Gallery – the first Australian gallery dedicated to the work of photographers. Soon afterwards, he moved into studio space in Fitzroy, and between 1978 and 1986 created a series of black-and-white portraits of his friends and contemporaries – 'artists, actors, drug addicts and other fellow marginals', as McNicol has said. This series was exhibited in Melbourne, Cracow and Paris in the 1980s. In 1989–1990, McNicol undertook an Australia Council-funded residency in the cancer ward of Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, during which time he created a series of portraits of terminally ill patients, exhibited as Art and the Cancer Ward in Melbourne in 1992. Deeply affected by this experience, McNicol shelved his photographic practice for several years during the 1990s. He completed a Master of Fine Arts at Monash University in 2007, his major project being to recreate the portraits from the 1978–1986 _Portrait of Melbourne_ series. McNicol's work has been included in many solo and group exhibitions including the Australian Photographic Portrait Prize (2004–2006); the Olive Cotton Portrait Prize (2005–2008); and the National Portrait Gallery exhibitions _Reveries: Photography and Mortality_ (2007) and _Life and Time: Portraits by Rod McNicol_ (2015). The winner of the 2004 Australian Photographic Portrait Prize, McNicol was a finalist in 2007 and 2010. He took out the National Photographic Portrait Prize in 2012 with his portrait of his friend, actor Jack Charles, who McNicol has been photographing since the 1970s. McNicol's work is represented in major collections including those of the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Monash Gallery of Art, and the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris."

In 1916 he founded an art school in the city, and many students from the NGV school left it to join Meldrum's. They were the first of many generations of Australian artists known as 'Meldrumites', who were indoctrinated in what Meldrum believed to be the 'invariable truths of depictive art' and the 'science of appearance' relating to tonal and space relations between objects."

Born in Jeparit, Victoria, Menzies attended school in Ballarat and studied at Melbourne University, where he gained a reputation as a brilliant speaker. Following early success at the Bar and in state politics, he entered Federal parliament in 1934. He became Prime Minister in the early years of World War 2 as leader of the United Australia Party, but bitter divisions led to his resignation and the disintegration of the UAP. From the back benches, Menzies founded the Liberal Party, which he led from 1944 to 1966. As Prime Minister through a period of remarkable national prosperity, Menzies cultivated the USA as a 'powerful friend', furthering the two nations' economic and military ties. A staunch monarchist, he was invested as the first Australian Knight of the Thistle and succeeded Winston Churchill as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1965 to 1978."

                    "content": "Margaret Michaelis, photographer, was born Margarethe Gross, of Polish Jewish parents at Dzieditz, near Bielsko. She moved to Vienna to study for three years at the Institute of Graphic Arts, and soon after graduation gained a job at a portrait photography business, where she remained for five years. Having worked in Prague and Berlin, in 1929 she settled in Berlin, where she worked intermittently in a number of studios. In the early 1930s she married and she and her husband had to flee to Spain; they divorced, but she remained in Barcelona, where she established her own business, Foto-Elis, and proceeded to take some key representations of the city’s architecture. She was able to gain a German passport in Poland in 1938; by way of London, she arrived in Sydney in September 1939. In 1940, she opened a studio in Castlereagh Street, specialising in portraits, especially of Jewish people, dancers and artists. Notwithstanding that she spent the war under observation, she continued to work, and in 1945 she became an Australian citizen. In 1952, her failing eyesight caused her to close her business. In 1960 she moved to Melbourne to marry a glass merchant named Sachs; she assisted him in his framing enterprise during the course of her twenty-five years’ residence in the city. The National Gallery has a large collection of Michaelis’s works, as does the historical archive of the College of Architects in Barcelona. Solo retrospective exhibitions were held by the National Gallery of Australia in 1987 and 2005 and in Valencia in 1998. Helen Ennis’s book _Margaret Michaelis love, loss and photography_ was published in 2005."

Abbotsleigh-educated and funded for tertiary study by an inheritance, she refused to continue her arts degree at Sydney University because of insufficient Australian course content. From the age of thirty eight she had no fixed address and was notable for her anarchic conduct in public places. A portly individual in a green eyeshade and greatcoat, she carried a board advertising her willingness to recite Shakespeare for a fee. She loved tram and taxi travel and often hurled herself at vehicles refusing to carry her because of her disposition for fare avoidance. Although she was frequently assaulted by aggrieved drivers, she did pay £600 for a return trip to Perth by cab. She lived by a number of well-documented maxims, and remained a wayward wit into her impoverished and infirm old age."

At twenty she moved to France, where she worked as a model and actress. In the mid-1970s she studied photography at Prahran College in Melbourne under Athol Shmith, Paul Cox and John Cato. Since then she has worked as a freelance photographer specialising in portraiture. Her work has appeared in Australia and internationally in magazines and newspapers, on CD and book covers and on theatre and music posters; her wide-ranging commissions have given rise to a considerable collection of portraits of culturally significant Australians. Mitelman won the National Photographic Portrait Prize in 2011 and the National Portrait Gallery owns twenty of her portraits. Her works are also held by the National Library, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Museum of Modern Art at Heide and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery."

It was really the first time [that] time disappeared for me, you know; I was so excited about doing it.\\n\\nMost people, even people who are really well known and photographed all the time, feel a bit vulnerable. It’s incredibly easy to take a horrible picture of somebody where they look really tense and they don’t look like themselves. So, I guess I’m interested in people being comfortable. And I’m interested in, not the eyes that are uncomfortable and’ how I’m going to look’, I’m interested in the eyes that try to get some sort of straight gaze where at least you have the impression that you’re contacting the essence of that person. I mean, there was a phrase that I quite used to like, which was Buddha Nature, which means, you know, like that in you which doesn’t change. Obviously, it can be damaged, but you can take pictures of quite small children. And you know that there’s something in that photograph that if you came back 50 years later, there would be still the same thing in it. And that’s sort of, I guess, what I’m interested in, really.\\n\\nTaking photographs is a bit like a temporary infatuation for me. Because I’m not interested in taking awkward pictures of somebody. So it’s a bit like, you know, that process when you fall in love with somebody, they do one thing, into that one thing you attach all these qualities which they don’t have, they just do that one thing. But you don’t want to show somehow … you don’t want to see the bad things in that state. You just put all the good things together. I’ve taken photographs of people who have looked at them afterwards and I’ve thought, yes, the person who’s in love with him sees him like that.",

                    "content": "Helge Jon Molvig was born and grew up in Newcastle, where he left school at thirteen and worked in a garage and at the steelworks. After war service in New Guinea and Manila, he enrolled as an art student under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme at the Strathfield campus of East Sydney Technical College. He exhibited with the Strath Art Group between 1949 and 1954 (thereafter, he was part of no group). During this period, from 1949 to 1952, he travelled in Europe, where he was particularly influenced by the German and Norwegian expressionists. In 1955 he settled in Brisbane, where he began to paint passionately intense and personal works that are now in the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Queensland Art Gallery. As a teacher, he encouraged a number of innovative artists including Andrew Sibley and Merv Moriarty to pursue their own visions. In 1961 he won the inaugural Transfield prize, the country’s richest art award, and was able to purchase land near Brisbane on which he built a house. Through the 1960s he won a series of art prizes in Queensland, and exhibited with the Sydney dealer Rudy Komon. Molvig’s work is notoriously variable in style; his many portraits illustrate his many different approaches to his art. From 1952 he entered the Archibald, but was not hung until 1955. In 1966, his portraits of Charles Blackman and Sir Charles Moses were both hung; he won the prize for the Blackman portrait, which is now in the Art Gallery of South Australia. From the late 1960s he was increasingly ill with chronic kidney disease; he died following the rejection of a kidney transplant in Brisbane. A retrospective of his work initiated by the Newcastle Region Art Gallery toured nationally in 1978. Molvig is represented in all major Australian galleries, with his striking portraits dispersed between them."

I try to use colours that heighten the feeling of what I want to say. For instance, if I was painting a young girl, I wouldn’t use browns and purples and heavy colours like that; I’d naturally use something that’s light and youthful and airy, happy, perhaps, depending on whether I wanted to make her happy or sad. If I was painting an old man, I wouldn’t use light greens and light blues, things like that. That’s only a very rough basis for psychology of colour.\\n\\nQuite often I use drawings, particularly in portraits. When I have a portrait commission to do – not a commission necessarily but a portrait – I usually do a lot of drawings. I like to become familiar with the subject, especially the character of the subject and the general feeling of it. I usually throw the drawing away and do the painting from memory. But usually now, with an ordinary subject, I just start straight on the large canvas and work it out from there. Once a picture is started, it sort of paints itself. What I mean is: when you put a brushstroke down, it indicates the next brushstroke to put down and so on, it’s like doing a jigsaw puzzle in which you put one piece in place and you have to find another piece to fit in with it.",

And he introduced me to the authorities that were handling the staging of the play. And I particularly wanted to show the Parthenon at the top of the hill, at the top of the Acropolis, behind the action that was going on, on the stage. But this meant getting the floodlights turned on, on the Parthenon at a particular time. Now, I thought this would be very, very difficult indeed, but as it turned out, the authorities were only too pleased to co-operate, and they said ‘No, that would be no problem’, and ‘we can do it at a certain time and if you’re in your position at a certain time, everything’ll be fine’, and they gave me all sorts of help from a position point of view; and I could roam where I wanted to and photograph this play and the environment on this beautiful night in Athens. And I turned to my helper and I said, ‘Well, you know, this sort of co-operation is more than I could ever expect, it’s beautiful.’ I said, ‘All we want now, just when we’re taking these pictures, all we want now is for the full moon to rise through the Parthenon’, joking, you see. And he said ‘Well, I’ll see if I can arrange it’, so I thought that was very funny. So there we were, taking these pictures, and the lights came on at the right time, and he tapped me on the shoulder and he pointed up and I looked up and there was the full moon, rising right through the Acropolis.\\n\\nI took some pictures at that point but that was not the one that was used – but that’s often the way it goes.",

                    "transcript": "In this book ‘Australia and New Zealand’ published by Life World Library, there are two colour pictures of Aboriginal children at Ernabella mission station. These children are of the Pitjantjatjara tribe and they have blond hair which tends to grow out in adolescence. And one afternoon we went out with about thirty of these children into the hills nearby, and as soon as we got there, the children virtually disappeared into the landscape, because they’re so sympathetic – their forms and their colouring is so sympathetic to the rocks and the earth – that you could hardly see the children in the landscape. The picture on page 114 tends to show this; the children are searching for rabbits and lizards and things in these marvellous rock forms.\\n\\nI found that these children [were] totally delightful, totally unsophisticated of course, genuine, happy, really beautiful kids. The light, of course, in this situation of photographing these children, was superb, it was bright low sun, and this accentuated this quality of fairness of hair that the children have, and the hair is very similar in colour and texture and the look of it in the picture, to the spinifex bushes which dot the landscape across the country there. But I find that whatever the light is, as a professional photographer you have to make it work for you one way or the other. There are certain things you would rather wait for and you have time to wait for, but very often the pressures are such that you just have to take it some way with what you’re given, and make it work. And it’s incredible how many times this can be done. I think that there was no problem in photographing these children – the light was superb – but to photograph them against the light so that the light is in fact coming through their hair, gives the hair more luminosity, more life, more movement.",

Having trained in drama in Paris, by 1951, when she came to Melbourne with her husband, Georges, she was committed to painting. Soon the couple became friends with the city's leading artists and collectors, and were instrumental in the re-formation of the Contemporary Art Society. Over the course of the 1950s and 1960s they opened the European-style Mirka Café in Exhibition Street (the first Melbourne café with outdoor seating), then Balzac in East Melbourne (the first restaurant with a licence to serve liquor after 10pm) and finally the Tolarno in St Kilda in 1966. While Georges established himself as an art dealer, opening Tolarno Galleries in 1967, Mirka became a bohemian icon of the city. Having worked prolifically for six decades across a range of media - including painting, drawing, embroidery, soft sculpture and doll-making - she is represented in many state and regional collections. Her mosaics decorate Flinders Street Station, she painted a tram, and in 2007 she was commissioned by new owner Guy Grossi to repaint the original murals with her characteristic softly rounded, angelic figures for his re-launched restaurant, Mirka at Tolarno Hotel. Her autobiography, _Wicked but Virtuous_ (2000), was followed by a book about her favourite things, _Love and Clutter_ (2003). Mirka's undimmed gusto and creative expression are highlighted by her 2016 collaboration with iconic Australian fashion label Gorman, two years before she died at the age of 90. Acknowledged for her formative influence on Melbourne's cultural identity, Mirka was loved as much for her contributions to contemporary art as for her generous and outrageous nature."

Actually my drawings are like living dreams. Sometimes they appear very incoherent but I know that all this incoherence, if I search in it the truth is there. Each drawing has a very strong meaning. It as if my unconscious – or subconscious – would want to become conscious. Each drawing is a riddle which I have to decipher, and this is why I can never, I will never stop drawing because the answers of the riddles always come, sooner or later.\\n\\nWhen I was expecting my third child I was drawing my little people all the time. Sometimes I’d draw little animals too, but they have human legs or they have human arms. This goes back far away in the history of art, of course, I’m aware of that, but it’s a truth and it travels all through time and it comes and visits some artists from time to time. Must be that little beast we’ve got inside us, that’s what it is. Anyhow, when I was expecting my third child, all my little drawings had four toes, and everybody used to say, ‘Why do you do four toes? You know a foot has five toes’, and I said, ‘Well, my people have four toes, you know, I can’t help it, my hand does it. I’m not thinking about it. It just has to have four toes because when I feel the foot it just comes out with four toes’. And when my baby came out, he was born, it had one foot with four toes.\\n\\nSo you can see what faith I have in my work. The truth is inside you always and you have to find it.",

Fleeing from Nazi Germany to Paris when he was 17, he changed his name to Georges Mora. During the war he took an active role in the Resistance; when peace came, he worked as a patent dealer. He married Mirka Zelik, a French-born Jewish artist, in 1947 and the couple migrated to Melbourne with their first son, Philippe in 1951. Two more sons, William and Tiriel, followed. Soon the couple became friends with the city's leading artists and collectors, including the Reeds, and were instrumental in the re-formation of the Contemporary Art Society. Over the course of the 1950s and 1960s they opened the European-style Mirka Café in Exhibition Street (the first Melbourne café with outdoor seating), the Balzac in East Melbourne (the first restaurant with a licence to serve liquor after 10pm) and the Tolarno in St Kilda. While Georges established himself as an art dealer as well as a restaurateur, Mirka became a Bohemian icon of the city. The couple separated in the early 1970s. In 1985 Georges married another artist, Caroline Williams, and they had a son, Sam, born in the same year. Made a Chevalier des Arts et Lettres in 1989, Georges was still operating the Tolarno Gallery in South Yarra when he died. William Mora lays claim to being one of only three second-generation art dealers in business in Australia today. The Georges Mora Foundation, launched by Dame Elisabeth Murdoch in 2006, is a not-for-profit cultural foundation dedicated to the promotion of contemporary art and artists in Melbourne and Australia."

                    "content": "Lewis Morley (1925–2013) established his reputation as one of the key British photographers of the 1960s and is known for his iconic image of a nude Christine Keeler straddling an Arne Jacobsen chair. He ran a highly successful studio above London's first satirical venue, the Establishment Club, where he formed important associations with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Barry Humphries and a range of as yet undiscovered young talents including Michael Caine who frequented the hip venue. Many of the faces he captured on film define the swinging sixties scene in London, including portraits of Charlotte Rampling, Vanessa Redgrave, Judy Dench, Jean Shrimpton and Peter O'Toole. He worked extensively for theatre and television, becoming sought after for his particular style of 'on location' and 'action' photography and portraiture. Migrating to Sydney in 1971, Morley found 'the sixties all over again'. Despite this, working in a new country in a new decade his work underwent a dramatic shift in approach to style and format. Shooting increasingly in colour for magazines such as _Dolly_, _POL_ and _Belle_, Morley's Australian work provides an evocative record of culture change through the 1970s and 1980s. Portraits from this era include images of Peter Carey, Brett Whiteley, Nicole Kidman, Marcia Hines, Sherbet and John Newcombe. The National Portrait Gallery held an exhibition of his work, _Myself and Eye_, in 2003; _Lewis Morley: 50 Years of Photography_ was staged at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2006."

In January 1834, he married one of his students, Lavinia Lord (1816–1875), the eldest of the five daughters of Thomas and Susan Lord. He left Ellinthorp in 1838 and established himself in Launceston as an artist, his students having supplied a useful connection to the colonists most likely to commission portraits. In late 1840 he relocated to a farm near Little Swanport at his father-in-law’s instigation. But Mundy’s attempt to make a living as a farmer failed, and by 1842 he’d moved to Hobart, where he sought work as an artist with ‘leisure for a few pupils who are desirous of instruction in painting, drawing or music.’ Mundy received favourable notice for his work and during the early 1840s completed a number of portrait commissions, but despite his ‘excellent taste and professional ability’, his practice gradually declined and exacerbated his alcoholism and depression. He took an overdose of laudanum in a Hobart pub in March 1848, leaving Lavinia and five children to ‘lament his untimely demise’."

                    "content": "Jenny Munro (b. 1956) is a Wiradjuri elder and prominent activist for Aboriginal rights and sovereignty. She has been involved with Aboriginal organisations since she first came to Sydney in 1973 and was at the forefront of the fight for Aboriginal housing at The Block in Redfern, Sydney. Munro's family has a long history in political activism and advocacy, dating back generations, with her great grandfather consistently fighting to stop the removal of Aboriginal people living in the Mission outside of Cowra. Her grandmother was involved in the Day of Mourning meetings in 1938 in Sydney and this legacy of activism forms a large part of inspiration in Munro's continual fight advocacy. Her brother and sister were involved heavily with the Aboriginal political movements in Sydney and in 1972, her siblings gave her the opportunity to travel to Canberra for the first Aboriginal Tent Embassy when she was seventeen. After graduating high school, Munro moved to Redfern and started her career within Aboriginal community-based organisations, notably the Aboriginal Medical Service, the Aboriginal Children's Service and the Aboriginal Legal Service.\\n\\nIn Sydney, she met her husband, Lyall Munro, and they both became founding members of the Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC). The AHC was established in 1973 in direct response to the racist and oppressive attitudes towards Aboriginal people, particularly in regards to discrimination within the private rental market and the ongoing conflicts between Aboriginal squatters in Redfern and local authorities. Known as The Block, the AHC began purchasing land using a $500,000 grant from the Whitlam government. In the 1970s and 80s, The Block became a new urban home where Aboriginal people had a sense of belonging and became an important site of Aboriginal self-determination and leadership. She and Lyall moved to an AHC-run house in the Sydney suburb of Marrickville.\\n\\nIn 2014, Munro established the Redfern Aboriginal Tent Embassy, a successful initiative that, after 400 days, resulted in Federal Government intervention, funding and a commitment to affordable housing for Aboriginal people. The embassy was a protest camp with an aim to keep The Block in Aboriginal hands, and to ensure the land is used solely for low-cost housing for Aboriginal people. The embassy was in response to the ongoing complaints that the AHC was not transparent about its financial affairs, and it was accused of nepotism and mismanagement. As median house prices in Redfern doubled in the late 1990s, the AHC began evicting Aboriginal tenants from The Block, and moving them to other AHC-owned houses further away from Sydney's centre. The AHC then demolished the vacated houses on The Block. CEO of the AHC, Michael Mundine claimed The Block was private land and announced plans to use the land across the road from The Block for a $70 million commercial development, including retail outlets, a gymnasium, and housing for 154 non-Aboriginal students from the nearby University of Sydney. On 21 February 2015, Mundine's AHC issued eviction notices to the tent embassy inhabitants, telling them they were on private land and that he would get the authorities to remove them. The Aboriginal people at the tent embassy vowed to stay. In August 2015 the protesters at the tent embassy lost a Supreme court case asking for a possession order for the land. The court instead ruled that the land was the property of the AHC. The protesters previously stated they would not vacate until the AHC prioritised affordable housing for Aboriginal people at the location. The Tent Embassy claimed victory later that month, when the federal government agreed to spent $70 million on 62 homes for Aboriginal people. The embassy has since been closed and as of July 2017, the site remains fenced off and undeveloped."

                    "content": "Arthur Murch, artist, is best-known as a painter in a colourful cubistic style, but he was occupied with sculpture throughout his career. Murch trained at Dattilo-Rubbo’s school between 1921 and 1925; meanwhile, in sculpture his most important teacher was Rayner Hoff. It was his sculpture that won him the 1925 Travelling Art Scholarship, which he spent most profitably in Italy. Later, his chief mentor was George Lambert, whom he assisted in Sydney from 1927 to 1930. At that time, Lambert was weakened by remnant malaria, and he greatly valued Murch’s strength, calling him the ‘pocket Hercules’. They worked together on the figure for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in St Mary’s Cathedral, and Murch completed the Henry Lawson Memorial after Lambert died in 1930. Other works Murch produced around the period of his association with Lambert include the memorial to Thorburn Brailsford Robertson in Adelaide University, and the Macarthur Onslow Memorial Light Horse Trophy. In 1933 he travelled with a scientific expedition to Hermannsburg, and he returned to the mission the following year. Many of his paintings reflect his interest in Indigenous culture and practises. In the late 1930s he was in the UK, and worked on the wool pavilion at the Glasgow Empire Exhibition. In 1941 he won the competition to execute the memorial relief in honour of Dame Nellie Melba in the Sydney Town Hall. During World War 2 he was an official war artist in the Northern Territory, working in Darwin and around the Adelaide River. Perhaps because his father was a carpenter-builder and he himself trained as an engineer, Murch sculpted in all imaginable media including fibreglass, rubber, pottery, stitched felt applique and cement - the latter when restoring Norman Lindsay’s garden sculptures. He was a foundation member of the Australian Academy of Art; he won the Society of Artists’ Medal in 1935 and the Archibald Prize for 1949. The 1977 exhibition _Project 19: Arthur Murch_ at the Art Gallery of New South Wales was the first major survey of Murch’s work by a public gallery. Now, the Art Gallery of New South Wales has many of his works; the Australian War Memorial has more than thirty of his paintings and drawings and he is represented in most Australian public galleries. The papers of Arthur Murch, collated by Ria Murch, are in the archive of the Art Gallery of New South Wales."

In 1940, the strikingly attractive 22-year-old was writing a story about the Original Ballets Russes, and met artist Arthur Murch, who was drawing the dancers. The attraction was irresistible; they married in 1941 and moved to Waterview Street, Mona Vale, the ‘mad half-mile’ where artists, writers and poets lived. After Arthur Murch’s war service, they moved to Avalon, where they built a house together. In 1954, Ria returned to work, while Arthur looked after their two children. Both Ria and the children appear in Murch’s paintings. She wrote advertising and publicity copy and a guide to Australian wine; later, she arranged flowers professionally, and worked at an art gallery. She was also a talented photographer. In the 1980s, she supported Murch during his decline from Alzheimer’s disease; in 1989, she commenced work on Arthur Murch: An artist’s life (1997). Late in life, she was a tireless writer of letters-to-the-editor and a passionate advocate for the care of the Northern Beaches. \\n\\nMargaret Michaelis photographed Arthur (in his army clothes) and Ria Murch in 1945 at 4 Delwood Close, Mona Vale.

In 1915 he became managing editor of the United Cable Service of the Sun and Melbourne Herald in London.

                    "content": "Graeme Murphy AO (b. 1950), choreographer and dancer, was co-artistic director of the Sydney Dance Company with his wife Janet Vernon AM for three decades. Born in Melbourne, Murphy grew up in Mole Creek, Tasmania, taking dance classes in Launceston. At age fourteen he was the youngest male dancer to be accepted into The Australian Ballet School in Melbourne; he commenced with The Australian Ballet three years later and choreographed his first ballet, _Ecco le Diavole_, in 1971. That year he received an Australia Council Grant to study overseas, studying with the Joffrey Ballet in New York, and dancing with the Royal Ballet in England and Les Ballets Félix Blaska in France. Back in Australia, he was appointed artistic director of the Sydney Dance Company (then known as The Dance Company NSW) in 1976, helping it to become one of Australia's most successful dance companies. His most popular piece is perhaps _Poppy_ (1978), a full-length ballet based on the life of Jean Cocteau, in which he danced the title role four years after announcing his retirement. In 2001 Murphy was presented with a Helpmann Award for _Body of Work: A Retrospective_; he won Australian Dance Awards for outstanding achievement in choreography for Tivoli in 2001 and Swan Lake in 2003. Named a Living National Treasure in 1999, Murphy retired from the Sydney Dance Company in 2007 after creating a repertoire of more than 50 works. Over the years he has also created productions for companies including Opera Australia, The Australian Ballet, Shanghai Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. His honours include the 2009 Best Choreography Green Room Award for _Firebird_ and the 2011 Fred & Adele Astaire Award for excellence in choreography for _Mao's Last Dancer_. He was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in June 2012 for his distinguished contribution to Australian dance. Murphy continues to direct and choreograph productions, including _Turandot_ (2019) and _The Merry Widow_ (2021) for Opera Australia."

Her father was Wapiti, an Elder from Merini in Kukatja Country in the Northern Territory. As their marriage was forbidden tribally, Ilkalita and Albert eloped in 1919. After returning to Hermannsburg Mission in 1923, where Albert had grown up, Ilkalita was baptised into the Lutheran faith and given the name Rubina. The couple had ten children; five sons and three daughters survived infancy. Their daughter, Nelda, born in 1928, died the following year from scurvy. Another daughter, Violet, born in 1935, lived for only five months. After Albert started painting in the 1930s, often the whole family would travel with him on his painting trips, living off the land. Rubina died in 1974 and is buried at Hermannsburg."

                    "content": "Arrernte artist Albert Namatjira (1902–1959) is one of Australia's most celebrated and important artists. He is recognised as the first person to link Aboriginal art and culture with European painting techniques. Born at Hermannsburg (Ntaria) near Alice Springs, Namatjira had been making art for much of his life before becoming interested in watercolour painting in the 1930s. Exhibiting from 1938 to acclaim and working prolifically, demand for his paintings increased during the 1940s. Though famous by the 1950s, First Nations people were not recognised in the Australian constitution at this time and faced widespread prejudice and inequality. Namatjira met Queen Elizabeth II in Canberra in 1954, and was the first Aboriginal person to receive citizenship in 1957, but restrictions on his family and his community remained engrained and complex, ultimately leading to his death in 1959. His distinctive style, though seemingly taking on the appearance of Western landscape traditions is rooted in deep ancestral connection and knowledge of the lands spanning his father’s country around the MacDonnell Ranges and his mother’s country in the region of Palm Valley in Central Australia. The Gamatj clan leader Yunupingu AM leader has explained that in his work Namatjira was 'demonstrating to the rest of the world the living title held by his people to the lands they had been on for thousands of years'."

He worked as a rouseabout and studied art in Queensland before moving to Sydney, where he worked in advertising. His first portrait commission came in 1982 from ad-man and entrepreneur John Singleton, for whom Naseby painted former Miss World Belinda Green, Singleton’s then wife. Naseby held his first solo exhibition in Sydney in 1998. In 1995 he became an Archibald Prize finalist for the first time with his portrait of poet Les Murray. That painting and Naseby's 1999 portrait of writer Bob Ellis (also an Archibald Prize finalist) were acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in 2001. Naseby's other portrait subjects include artists Adam Cullen and Kevin Connor, actor Max Cullen, cartoonist Bill Leak, former prime minister Sir John Gorton, rock legend Angry Anderson, golfer Greg Norman and footballer Sam Thaiday. His portrait of boxer Kostya Tszyu featured in the Sporting Archibald touring exhibition in 2000; and in 2014 he was a finalist for the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize. Also a landscape artist, Naseby was awarded a residency at Bundanon, Arthur Boyd's former home, in 2002; and he was in the running on multiple occasions for art prizes including the Mosman Art Prize, the Dobell Prize for Drawing, the Kedumba Drawing Award and the Wynne Prize. Naseby's works are held in private and corporate collections here and overseas and in those of public institutions such as the Museum of Australian Democracy and the State Library of New South Wales as well as the National Portrait Gallery."

                    "content": "Born in Maitland, New South Wales in 1975, Nell is a multidisciplinary artist working across painting, sculpture, video and performance. Through a unique signature style influenced by the fusion of religious iconography, rock 'n' roll aesthetics and Buddhist philosophy, her work explores the intersections and oppositional aspects of the human existence – birth and death, sacred and profane, sorrow and happiness, light and dark.\\n\\nThroughout her practice, Nell uses reoccurring and repetitive symbolic motifs as a tool for communicating the binaries of human existence. Her works are created using an array of materials and objects, ranging from the sacred to the pop with symbols such as smiley faces, ghosts, tear drops and lighting bolts conveying universal meanings of each icons. Often, a range of egg shapes are used to represent ideas of rebirth, regeneration and consider concepts of mortality. This fusion further highlights Nells interrogation and concern with time, death and impermanence. Music and art are inseparable for Nell, with the iconography associated with rock 'n' roll and pop culture heavily influencing her works. Objects such as band T-shirts, posters, album covers and guitar picks are considered personal devotional items and are often repurposed to be given a new life within an artwork. Through both large-scale immersive installation to intimate objects, Nell's practice embodies the nuances of the human condition while simultaneously amplifying the tensions, and differences to create new everyday rituals through the prescription of meaning to objects.\\n\\nAcross two decades, Nell's work has been included in over 300 exhibitions in Australia and abroad. Early in her exhibiting career, she was selected for _Primavera: Young Australian Artists at the Museum of Contemporary Art_, Sydney (1999), the annual curated exhibition of Australian artists aged under 35 years. Her early solo exhibitions – often collaborations with Mel O'Callahan - were in small venues in Sydney, Los Angeles, the Netherlands and Mumbai. In 1999 she founded the Rubyayre artist-run gallery in Sydney. Her first solo show at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery was in 2001and she has exhibited regularly there since. In 2003 and 2012 she exhibited _Nell_ and _Hometown girl has wet dream_ at the Maitland Regional Art Gallery. In between, in 2006 she gained her master's degree from Sydney College of the Arts, partly completed on a scholarship at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris. Her other awards include the Pat Corrigan Grant in 1999, the National Association for the Visual Arts Marketing Grant in 2001 and the Rome Studio of the Australia Council in 2003. She has several times been a finalist in the Blake Prize for Religious Art; her projects include a collaboration with the fashion label Romance Was Born in 2011. In 2011 and 2012 her work was included in the exhibitions _MONANISM_ and _Theatre of the World_ at MONA, Hobart. Well-known around Sydney as the long-term partner of celebrated chef Kylie Kwong, in late 2012 she was curator of the MCA ARTBAR. In 2013 she won the $50 000 University of Queensland National Artists' Self-Portrait Prize with a video of herself using a cricket bat to destroy a huge plastic fly (initially exhibited as _Fly as high as me_ in 2002).\\n\\nOther significant exhibitions include: _Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art 2016: Magic Object_, Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide (2016); _The National: New Australian Art, Museum of Contemporary Art_, Sydney (2017); and _Know My Name: Australian Women Artists 1900 to Now_, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra (2021). In 2016, Shepparton Art Museum presented an eponymously titled survey exhibition of Nell's works, _NELL_. A monograph on her work, published by Thames and Hudson, was released in 2020."

                    "content": "Sir Sidney Nolan AC OM CBE (1917–1992) was one of the most original and inventive Australian artists of the postwar decades, and one of few Australian artists to achieve an international reputation in the twentieth century. Born in Melbourne, Nolan studied at the National Gallery of Victoria's School of Art in 1934 and 1936. Beginning his career as a commercial artist in the 1930s, from 1938 he became associated with the modernist art patrons John and Sunday Reed at their homestead, Heide, in Heidelberg, Victoria. Nolan mounted his first solo exhibition in 1940, and two years later was conscripted into the army, serving as an army storeman in the Wimmera. Between 1946 and 1947 he made the enormously complex series of paintings of Ned Kelly for which he is best known. From 1951 Nolan lived abroad, but returned to Australia at regular intervals. He continued to explore Australian themes and landscapes in paintings of Burke and Wills, Eliza Fraser, Gallipoli and the Eureka rebellion, and in his huge masterpiece _Riverbend_ (1965). Knighted in 1981, Nolan was awarded the Order of Merit in 1983. He was also made a Companion of the Order of Australia, elected an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a member of The Royal Academy of Arts. A major exhibition of Nolan's work, _Sidney Nolan: A New Retrospective_, held at the Art Gallery of NSW and the National Gallery of Victoria in 2007–2008, brought together more than 100 of his works."

If you grew another arm, you know, you hope it would look like a painting, or anyway, put it this way: a painting sometimes feels like an extension of yourself.\\n\\nAnd I believe, in the past, that Chinese artists working some of their bamboo paintings, would put their fingers right into the brush, into bristles of the brush, and work there in order to feel this kind of electric thing flowing through them; that they want to get as close as possible to the ink. I think it’s something to do with growth, that this is one of the things that’s at you.\\n\\nAnd … the other obsession, or compulsion in a way, is that the growth shall be something that other people can recognise, that it’s got a meaning for them. And I think this is the kind of rather knife-edge thing that painters are on; that they want to produce something out of themselves but they want it to be something that other people will recognise. I mean, it’s almost as if, I suppose – although one hesitates to use the image – but if you produced a child and nobody liked it or recognised it or anything else. You not only produce it, but you want it to be part of the common experience and to be recognised as such.\\n\\nAnd I think in Australia now … is probably this rather wonderful position where all this is coming together. You don’t produce things out of your own compulsions to find that they fall on stony ground. It’s now beginning that you’re getting a response, and this of course enables you to produce more and more and make it richer and richer.\\n\\nAnd it seems to me that young painters now, here in Australia, are just at the moment when they can kind of have full confidence that whatever they produce honestly will meet with the recognition, and from this moment on you get back to what you got in Italy and Spain and all these things; you get the community and the art matching each other.",

                    "content": "Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920–1993), formerly Kath Walker, was a Quandamooka woman, activist, poet, writer and educator. Born in Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island) in Queensland, she enlisted in the Australian Women's Army Service in 1942 before beginning her career in political activism. In the 1940s she was a member of the Communist Party of Australia, which opposed racial discrimination. She became Queensland State Secretary of the Federal Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advancement in 1961, and campaigned successfully for amendments to Sections 51(xxvi) and 127 of the Constitution in 1967. In the 1970s she chaired a number of bodies set up to promote Indigenous interests, including the Queensland Aboriginal Advancement League. Throughout her life, she aimed to promote cultural pride among Aboriginal people through her writing, which she described as 'sloganistic, civil rightish, plain and simple'. Her first book of poetry, _We are Going_, published in 1964, was the first poetry publication by an Aboriginal person. Noonuccal returned to Minjerribah in 1971 where she taught Aboriginal culture to thousands of school children, and published two children's books: _Stradbroke Dreamtime_ (1972) and _Father Sky and Mother Earth_ (1981). Having gained world acclaim for her writing and advocacy (for which she was also conferred with four honorary doctorates), she published her last collection of poems, _Kath Walker in China_, in 1988. That year, she reassumed her tribal name in protest at the Bicentennial celebrations, and returned the MBE she had been awarded in 1970."

There was a deputation from all over Australia of Aboriginal spokesmen and women and we did go in. Sir Robert Menzies had told the public and the politicians, the people of the House, that he would not have a referendum in his lifetime as prime minister. He’d been badly beaten on the referendum before where he had appealed to the people to outlaw Communism and when the people said ‘No outlawing of the Communist Party’, Sir Robert Menzies refused then to have anything to do with referendums in his lifetime as prime minister.\\n\\nWe lobbied the House of Parliament and it’s to their discredit, really, that when we asked them to bring out the laws concerning the Aboriginal people that there was no laws, no books on the Aboriginal people in their archives or libraries, and they had to quickly have them printed, so that the politicians could read what it was, for and against the Aborigines. There was one, however, on the national – the Canberra law book saying that if Aboriginals go into Canberra, any Justice of the Peace could declare them illegal immigrants into Canberra and they could be chased out of Canberra. This still applied to us, incidentally, at this period of time. And we always made a joke of it when we went to Canberra, you know, ‘If you get into trouble, you know the law on the book. If a JP says Get Out, make sure you get your blanket,’ because the law still said that before sending them out of Canberra, they must first issue them with one government blanket. So we were determined we’d get our government blanket if ever they threw us out.  \\nWe told everyone this and we made it a laughingstock – Canberra a laughingstock – to such an extent that the first thing Sir Robert Menzies did was delete that off the Canberra constitution. So it’s no longer there.",

It’s easy to put a mark on a ballot paper, and I must say this definitely, that there was a small minority group of sincere Australian people but I would say 75 [per cent] of those who voted Yes did it to clear their guilty conscience.\\n\\nIncidentally, it’s interesting to understand why those terrible discriminative laws were put into the books. In the first place, our civic fathers, or the white man’s civic fathers of long ago, during the ‘soothing of the dying pillow’ era, the politicians, or the statesmen of that time, were writing over to Queen Victoria saying, ‘The Aborigine is dying out.’ And true, he was – they were poisoning him with strychnine in the waterholes and they were shooting him, and they were doing all sorts of things. And the Aborigine dropped from 300,000 strong to 80,000 in a very short period of time. So it was quite natural for them to say the Aborigine was a dying race.\\n\\nNow it was during this period of time that the Constitution was being fixed, and as they thought we were a dying race, to save themselves a lot of bother they said, ‘Well we will not count the Aborigines and we do not have to make laws for the Aborigines, because they’re going to die out anyway’. And this is the reason today why Aboriginals have not had any education, any decent housing, any facilities that the white Australian enjoys today. It’s because of that stupid business of thinking the Aboriginals were going to die out.\\n\\nMind you, the Aboriginals are a determined lot, and they’re quite ungrateful. They didn’t die, they lived on and are still living on; in spite of the many attempts to commit genocide and assassinate us all, we are still here. I think we’ll last the white man out, truly.",

Born at Indulkana in the APY Lands in South Australia, she was removed from her mother at the age of two and raised in a children’s home run by missionaries at Quorn in the Flinders Ranges. She recollects that she became rebellious at a young age after hearing her culture being denigrated. ‘I was always asking the question about who am I, where did I come from, who’s my mother and who’s my father, and where are they? Never got any answers to any of that at all,’ she says. At 16 she got a job as a nanny. Encouraged to become a nurse, she applied for a traineeship and was – eventually – accepted, becoming the first Aboriginal woman to complete her nursing training at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. She worked there until the early 1960s, and also travelled to remote communities, learning about her heritage through ‘just doing what I could to heal people’. She joined the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1967 and by 1975 she had become its regional director in South Australia. In 1977 she was elected Foundation Chair of the National Aboriginal Conference, formed under prime minister Malcolm Fraser as a peak body to advise the Federal government on Indigenous affairs, and she chaired the Aboriginal Development Commission from 1989 to 1990. Named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1983, she was Australian of the Year in 1984, and in 1999 she was named a Companion of the Order of Australia. In 2005 she was invested by Pope John Paul II as a Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great. While Chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission between 1990 and 1996, she helped to draft the Mabo legislation. The holder of six honorary doctorates, she was the patron of the Lowitja Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research. In 2022, on her 90th birthday, the Lowitja Institute formed the Lowitja O’Donoghue Foundation to continue and preserve her legacy."

So, I’m not sure that he knew much about [the] Stolen Generation. After I saw the portrait come out, I myself felt the portrait wasn’t like me because Robert had told me very early in the piece that I wasn’t to smile. He doesn’t like smiling portraits. People who know me of course know that I do smile a lot.\\n\\nThe suit that I wore on the day, I think he was a bit surprised because it was really quite formal and it’s a suit that I wear when I receive the many awards that I’ve received over the years. My family had no difficulty at all seeing me turn up in that same suit. And because it was a portrait, I thought, well, you know, I’m an Aboriginal woman and I’m going to wear the Aboriginal flag, and I’m going to wear everything red, black and yellow.\\n\\nI’m much more proud of the fact that I’m a nurse and that I was able to use my nursing experience to actually travel to remote areas in my own, well in my own right, just doing what I could to heal people. I didn’t know my people very well and so on, this is one way of getting to know them out on the APY lands. I have had a lot of senior jobs, met just so many people in high places, really.

She was well known in the Sydney post war art scene and her portrait was painted by Drysdale and Dobell – Dobell’s painting won the 1948 Archibald Prize. Olley held her first one-person show that year. It was a sellout, and she held at least one solo exhibition annually from then on. In 1991 she reprised her success of 43 years before, when a show of thirty-five of her intimate, brilliantly coloured interiors and still lifes sold out again. The Art Gallery of New South Wales held a major retrospective show of her long career in 1996/7. Olley remained one of Sydney’s best-known arts identities to her death, curating an exhibition with Barry Humphries called ‘Favourites’ at the SH Ervin Gallery in 2002, continuing to paint, and posing for numerous portraits by younger artists she encouraged, including Nicholas Harding and Ben Quilty. In the 1980s she endowed the Margaret Hannah Olley Art Trust, of which several Australian galleries, including the National Portrait Gallery, have been beneficiaries. Quilty’s portrait of Olley won the Archibald Prize in 2011. Tweed River Art Gallery is home to the Margaret Olley Art Centre which includes a reproduction of Olley’s studio and living space."

This I don’t arrange and then paint it immediately; I always have a very definite idea what I want to do. Sometimes it doesn’t come off immediately, sometimes it does, and this is a very satisfying thing. Other times I paint say for a whole day, and then leave it for several weeks; it might go on for months or even six weeks, taking out something, repainting again.\\n\\nI very rarely make a detailed sketch of what I intend to do. I might make little thumbnail notes but never very detailed, because I feel you kill the painting you want to do.\\n\\nPainting to me is like drawing; you draw with your brush or your palette knife, so whether one is using a paintbrush or watercolour or a pen, it’s all creative, and I never mind which medium I’m using.\\n\\nThe paintings I do are naturally things I – I’m inspired whether it’s the colour, the shape; it might be the colour of the skin of a native woman, it doesn’t matter.\\n\\nI can hear myself saying things that are so trite, and they’re not really how I want to say them. This is a dreadful thing for a painter. We say it in paint, otherwise we’d be a writer or perhaps a musician, who knows?",

In 1976 he became the youngest-ever president of the South Australian Liberal Party. Having been elected member for Rocky River in 1979, he led the opposition in South Australia from 1982 to 1990, when he was appointed to the Federal Senate. In 1992 he returned to the South Australian parliament as the member for Kavel; four years later he became South Australian premier. During his premiership he encouraged investment in the economically beleaguered state and pressed for corporatisation and privatisation of government services; in particular, he is associated with water management and recycling initiatives that boosted production in the Barossa and elsewhere. He resigned from office in 2001 following an enquiry established to investigate a government contract. From 2002 to 2006 he was Australia’s consul-general in Los Angeles, in which capacity he initiated the enduringly successful Australia Week, a significant driver of American tourism, trade and investment in Australia. Subsequently, until 2009, he was consul-general in New York. Currently chair of the American Australian Association Ltd and a member of the board of the US Studies Centre at the University of New South Wales, in mid-2017 he became the president of the South Australian Liberal Party for the second time."

                    "content": "Sir Douglas Frank Hewson Packer KBE (1906-1974), media proprietor, grew up in Sydney and became a cadet journalist on the Daily Guardian, owned by his father RC Packer, in 1923. Four years later he became advertising director of Smith's Newspapers Ltd, of which his father owned a large share. In June 1933 he and his mentor, EG Theodore, published the first edition of the Australian Women's Weekly - an instant success. Three years later, having inherited all his father's media interests, he formed Consolidated Press Ltd with Theodore and became its managing director. After World War II, in which he served on the Allied Works Council and, briefly, in New Guinea, he ramped up his papers' support of the Liberal and Country parties, during the Cold War 'turning increasingly to the right', according to his biographer Bridget Griffin Foley. Later, he was dubbed a 'king-maker' for his role in the rise of Prime Minister William McMahon. In 1955 he established Television Corporation Ltd, which began transmitting through TCN 9 the following year. He was knighted in 1959, two years before he acquired and revivified the Bulletin. A keen sportsman from his unscholarly schooldays, Packer played golf and polo, bred horses and boxed. He was an aggressive sailor, and chaired a syndicate that built Gretel and Gretel II to challenge the America's Cup in 1962 and 1970. In 1972, after he had been made KBE, he sold the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph to Rupert Murdoch, who had previously paid tribute, albeit equivocally, to Packer's business acumen. By the time he died, still mourning the loss of his papers and planning to restart his presses, his Australian Consolidated Press was the largest magazine publisher in the southern hemisphere. Packer's first wife, Gretel Bullmore, died in 1960. In 1964 he married Florence Porges in London, and they returned to live in Australia. Upon his death his empire passed to his younger son, Kerry."

Her first solo exhibition was in 1981, by which time she had exhibited in both the Archibald and Portia Geach competitions. She has won the People’s Choice Award of the Archibald three times, with portraits of Paul Lyneham (1992), Bill Leak (1995) and Patrick Dodson (1998), and she won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize in 1994 with a portrait of her father, veteran _Women’s Weekly_ illustrator John Mills. Palaitis had painted John Howard for the Archibald Prize competition of 1979, and otherwise knew the Howards slightly as their children had been at the same preschool. When she was chosen for the commission, the three met at Kirribilli House to discuss her conception of the work. As she took many informal snaps of them in different areas of the grounds, the interaction between the artist and her subjects became freer. Unlike many portraitists, Palaitis is happy to show her sitters the work as it evolves from photographs to watercolour studies to the final canvas, and the Howards viewed it several times over the course of the 650 hours it took her to paint in her studio. In response to media and public interest in the work, Palaitis maintained that ‘foremost in my mind was to portray, in whatever way, a sense of relationship between the couple’, whom she found ‘sincere and unpretentious’."

Two years after arriving in Australia, Pecket contracted polio, which left her partially paralysed and reliant on crutches and leg braces for the rest of her life. Despite this and being from a large, working-class family with little interest in art, Pecket was determined to become an artist. 'Disabilities are supposed to take everything from life, to leave it hollow and empty,' she said in a 1937 interview, 'but they don't. They make you try all the harder. One makes up one's mind to succeed despite the odds, and one does.' From around 1934, and with financial assistance from the NSW Society for Crippled Children, Pecket studied full-time at East Sydney Technical College, undertaking courses in drawing, printmaking, painting and modelling. Her solo exhibition at the college in 1937 featured more than 60 works and included etchings, drawings, watercolours and mural designs along with oil paintings. Having completed her diploma, Pecket established a studio in Castlereagh Street, Sydney, where she initially painted and taught art. Subsequently, during the 1940s and early 1950s, she produced and sold a range of decorative ceramics under her own label, Christine Ware. In 1955, she bought a house in Cammeray, where she established a home studio and returned to painting and teaching. She published an autobiography, _Some facets of my life_, in 1976."

From 1950 onward he travelled extensively in Central Australia, and throughout the sixties painted views of desert landscapes and Aboriginal people. In the early sixties he taught art at evening classes at Sutherland School, and also worked sporadically as an art critic for the Mirror newspaper group and a broadcaster for the BBC in London. However, his principal employment was producing advertising material for the Sydney County Council. He held many solo and group shows in Sydney from 1960 onward, and won municipal art awards in Kogarah, Campbelltown and Rockdale. In 1970 his work was featured in an 'Art Sale for Land Rights' at Paddington Town Hall with proceeds going to the New South Wales, Kimberley and North Queensland Aboriginal Land Councils. He is represented in the Art Gallery of New South Wales; the National Library; the Newcastle Art Gallery; the Howard Collection (Armidale); the Sutherland Shire Council; the National Bank in Adelaide; the Commonwealth Advisory Board; and in private collections in Australia and abroad."

Sometimes I would, of course, sketch, mostly with pencil, and where portraits were concerned, directly on the canvas with paint. Later on, after coming back from England, I used to make more sketches but I did my painting, the actual portrait, directly from the sitter. In those days you could get a sitter to sit still but nowadays they don’t sit still, they want everything done in a hurry so that the method has to change. It takes very much longer to paint a portrait than it used to, simply because you can’t get your sitter.\\n\\nIn my _Portrait of Richard_, [a] schoolboy about 12 years of age, I remember that I painted him or drew him in, first of all, with terre verte and then painted directly in colour. It took me about three weeks. He came and stayed with me and so we worked every day.\\n\\nIn a portrait I try to get the character as well as the outside resemblance of the sitter, to get the feeling, because that would be your feeling of the sitter; it wouldn’t be the sitter’s feeling of you, fortunately. In this particular case I was very fortunate. It’s a portrait of my nephew and he was very co-operative indeed.",

It means that you can be interested in people you are painting; doesn’t necessarily follow that you’re always interested in the particular job you’re doing, although you make the best of it you can. Some sitters are more sympathetic than others and if you get no co-operation from a sitter it makes it very heavy going. However, you try to make the most of the composition and take some other interest in it.\\n\\nI think that my attitude to a portrait has to be reasonably objective, it’s impossible to get rid of the artist’s subjectivity altogether and necessarily one person sees another person in a slightly different light to what the next one would, and that does always condition your choice of position and your choice of light and your choice of angle and of expression that you’ll put on a sitter. Nevertheless, I still, in a portrait, like to get more information about the sitter than I do about the artist who painted it. I think the work can be a work of art and yet be reasonably objective.\\n\\nBut I’ve had the experience that if I put what I thought was a reasonably amiable expression on a person’s face and it seems to be an amiable person to me and the family accept that, to somebody else it’s a supercilious smirk just because they don’t like the person in any case, so that to the beholder all things are true. So that by this type of objectivity, you’re not completely bound down to the limitations of pure subjectivity which emphasises and underlines one person’s relation to the object at which he’s looking.",

He showed an interest in photography from his early teens, but it was not until the late 1920s - after he had emigrated to Australia in 1926 - that his interest developed into a professional career. Poignant lived first in Sydney, then moved to Perth where he established himself as a portrait and wedding photographer, later as an aerial photographer for Western Mining. Two friendships were to have a profound effect on the direction of his work. In 1939 he met the naturalist Vincent Serventy and in 1940 he met the artist/photographer (later gallery director) Hal Missingham. Poignant shared an exhibition with Missingham in 1941. The following year Poignant began his extensive photographic documentation of the outback and Aboriginal people, travelling the Canning Stock Route. The most extensive photographic record Poignant made was in 1952 when he shared a camp for several months with senior Aboriginal men at the Liverpool River. Poignant's second marriage led him back to England in 1956. England was to remain his base until his death but he returned to Australia frequently in his later years. In 1982 the Art Gallery of New South Wales mounted a major retrospective of his photographs."

                    "content": "Clifton Pugh AO was one of Australia’s best-known artists of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and one of its leading advocates for the arts. Born in Richmond, he grew up in Melbourne, moving to Adelaide as a teenager. There, while waiting to enlist, he attended evening classes at the South Australian School of Art. After serving with the AIF, and then for a year in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, he returned to Australia to pursue a career as an artist. Under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Scheme, he attended classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, training under Sir William Dargie. Although a favourite of Dargie’s, soon after completing his course Pugh did away with tonalism, developing a style that is at once expressionistic and figurative, seeking to fuse successfully the rival approaches to painting the virtues of which the arts community debated so passionately in the 1950s. In 1959 he was one of seven artists who signed the Antipodean Manifesto. As Pugh’s popularity grew, so too did the demand for a portrait by him, which increased with his second and third Archibald victories in 1971 and 1972. Reluctant to accept commissions for portraits, he preferred to paint people with whom he had developed some degree of spiritual, intellectual or imaginative connection. These came to include some of Australia’s leading artists, philanthropists and academics. Pugh is now best remembered, however, for his portraits of politicians; his own deep interest in the arts and politics emerged publicly in his chairmanship of the Arts and Cultural Policy Committee of the Victorian Branch of the ALP from 1971. Once described as a court painter to the Australian Labor Party, he portrayed many of its key figures, including Gough Whitlam, Don Dunstan, Clyde Cameron, Clyde Holding, Lionel Murphy and Tom Uren. Yet, moved by various impulses, he also completed portraits of other politicians and statesmen, amongst them Harold Holt, John McEwen, Viscount de L’Isle, the Duke of Edinburgh and Sir John Kerr."

But always very upset because whenever they were aware of me, they’d gallop off, and I used to feel, if I could let them know that I’m not going to harm them. But perhaps because of other human beings they were scared. And my feeling the whole time was, if I could only get the birds and animals to realise that I’m not going to harm them.\\n\\nI saw one kangaroo had been shot and I was really upset about this and I used to go back and look at this – remains. Then I got a shock the following spring, that the animal had practically disintegrated, but out of that area where this animal had died, there were these most beautiful orchids. And that gave me the realisation of this continuing cycle, is that this kangaroo had to die to produce something in the soil that produced these orchids, because they weren’t anywhere else, they were just in this one spot. So all the paintings from then on, right up ‘til halfway through ’64, were of birds and animals, and this continuing cycle, always the paintings took the form, organic form of a movement, you could almost call it like a circle, ‘til this trip came up to the north-west, up to the Kimberleys. There I had a very, very big change of feeling. As I said before, I felt myself not belonging to the world – we were some mistake. Going up there, I felt myself starting to belong for the very first time, and it’s made a big change to the paintings, because now I’m painting human beings, they’re in all the paintings I’m doing, because for the first time perhaps, at the age of 40, I’m feeling myself starting to belong in the world, that is, the world in its total stage, not just human beings and animals but all being one.",

He worked as a jackaroo for three years before undertaking art studies at the Grosvenor School in London. Back in Melbourne, he studied at the George Bell School where he met Maisie Mathews, who later became his wife. In 1938, Purves Smith left for Europe, where he painted major works including _Kangaroo Hunt_, acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, New York. He was an imaginative and inventive painter; the elongated figures and surrealist elements that Drysdale was to extend in representations of the Australian landscape were present in Purves Smith's paintings in the late 1930s and early 1940s. After proposing to Maisie, who had returned to Australia, Purves Smith joined the British Army in 1940 and served in West Africa and Burma until he was hospitalised with tuberculosis. He and Maisie married in 1946 in Melbourne, with Drysdale as best man; Purves Smith died following surgery to relieve his symptoms in 1949, at the age of 37."

He held his first solo exhibition at the Step Gallery in Sydney in 2001and from 2004 exhibited with Jan Murphy Gallery in Brisbane. He has also exhibited with GRANTPIRRIE since 2008. In 2002 he won the Brett Whiteley Travelling Art Scholarship and he was a finalist in the Archibald and Wynne prizes in 2004. An Archibald finalist again in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2012, he won the prize in 2011 with a portrait of Margaret Olley. In 2006 he was one of the artists exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery exhibition Truth and Likeness, curated by Michael Desmond. He went to Afghanistan in October 2011 as an official war artist, commissioned by the Australian War Memorial and attached to members of the Australian Defence Force deployed as part of Operation Slipper. In January 2013 he was appointed to the board of trustees of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Later that year, Michael Desmond curated his major solo show Trigger Happy at the Drill Hall, Canberra. In January 2014 Quilty was the overall winner of the Prudential Eye Award in Singapore, which carried a substantial cash prize and entitled him to an exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery, London – he was the first Australian to have a solo show there. Since May 2014 he has been represented by Pearl Lam Galleries in Shanghai as well as Tolarno in Melbourne. In August 2014, Quilty’s After Afghanistan and Shaun Gladwell: Afghanistan were exhibited together at Perth’s John Curtin Gallery. Quilty lives and works in Robertson, New South Wales. Remarkably handsome, and renowned as a new-style man’s man, he has appeared twice on the ABC’s Australian Story and was named Artist of the Year by the men’s magazine GQ in 2013.

                    "content": "Norma Redpath OBE (1928-2013), sculptor, studied at Swinburne and RMIT and undertook broad travel studies in Europe in the 1950s. Her early, immaculately-finished sculptural work attracted attention at the Centre Five exhibitions and at the annual exhibitions of the Victorian Sculptors’ Association, of which she became a council member and vice-president. She made a relief sculpture for the Baillieu Library at the University of Melbourne in 1961. The following year an Italian scholarship took her overseas; she worked in bronze-casting foundries and established headquarters in Milan. From that time she travelled often between Italy and Australia and Italian became her second language. She held her first major Australian exhibition of bronze castings at Gallery A, Melbourne, in 1963; the exhibition, documented by Wolfgang Sievers, was a great success, commercially as well as critically. A large wall piece she made for BP House in St Kilda road, Melbourne was installed in 1964. In 1965 she was commissioned to make what turned out to be her masterpiece: the _Treasury Fountain, Canberra_, 1965-69 (made in Italy, and recently refurbished). Her other significant commissioned pieces include the Victorian coat of arms for the façade of the National Gallery of Victoria, installed in 1968. She made _Flying capital_ (the Sydney Rubbo Memorial) at the University of Melbourne (1970-74) in tribute to her lover, who had been professor of microbiology there. In 1972 Redpath was appointed HC Coombs Creative Arts Fellow at the Australian National University, spending about seven weeks in the capital in a ‘period of reassessment of myself and my work’ before returning to Milan to prepare sketches for a sculpture to be installed somewhere in the university grounds. Made in her Italian studio, the _Extended Column_ – stylistically related to the Rubbo memorial- was installed at the School of Music in time for its opening in mid-1976."

                    "content": "Alison Baily Rehfisch (1900–1975) was born Alison Green in Woollahra, New South Wales, to parents who 'were very interested in painting – in all the arts: music, literature, everything'. Her mother, a painter, woodcarver and accomplished musician, was a staunch supporter of women's rights and encouraged her daughter's interest in art. Rehfisch stated in 1965 that she began making art in earnest around the age of five in the wake of the death of her younger sister, her sole playmate. 'Life seemed so cruel without her, [so] I started to draw, pictures of God and heaven and angels and things … and the world to which I imagined she'd gone', Rehfisch said. Following the family's move to Mosman, she attended SCEGGS Redlands and after she finished school it was agreed that she should study art seriously. With her parents' full support, she studied under Julian Ashton at his Sydney art school for a time but left at the age of nineteen to marry Rodney Rehfisch, a warehouse manager. Their daughter was born in 1920. With her painting curtailed by wifehood and motherhood, it was several years before Rehfisch was able to resume her practice. When she did, she took classes with Antonio Dattilo-Rubbo at the Royal Art Society of New South Wales, where she met artist George Duncan. 'It was then that I really started to work', Rehfisch said, 'and from that day to now I’ve never ceased to work.' \\n\\nIn 1929, alongside her friend Dora Jarret, Rehfisch held her first exhibition at Farmer's Blaxland Gallery and she began exhibiting with the Society of Artists in 1931. By this time, she and her husband had separated and she was living in a studio apartment in Bridge Street in the city. Rah Fizelle, Dorrit Black, Thea Proctor and Adelaide Perry had digs in the same building. Heading to Europe in 1933, she studied at London's Grosvenor School of Modern Art under Iain MacNab, and became influenced by artists including Marc Chagall, El Greco, and Georges Braque – the latter for what she called his 'feeling of design, his reality. Reality has always appealed to me. I've always hated frills and that sort of thing, in life and in painting too', she said. With Duncan, Elaine Haxton and sculptor Gerald Lewers, Rehfisch held a show at Cooling Galleries in London in 1934; and in 1938, she was one of the cash-strapped expats, including William Dobell, who contributed to the gigantic felt mural designed by Arthur Murch for the Australian Wool pavilion at the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow. During her time abroad, Rehfisch also exhibited with the Society of Women Artists, the British Empire Society, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, and at the Societé des Beaux Arts, Paris.\\n\\nFollowing the death of her estranged husband, and having travelled and painted in Spain, France and Germany, Rehfisch returned to Sydney in late 1938. She and Duncan married there in December 1942. Duncan worked as a camouflage artist during the war, and he and Rehfisch exhibited jointly at Macquarie Galleries, and in group shows with the Contemporary Group and the Contemporary Art Society. A fire in their studio in 1947 – in which some 200 of Rehfisch’s paintings were destroyed – prompted a move away from the city, and for the next several years they lived in the Southern Highlands. From 1939 until 1969, Rehfisch exhibited regularly in solo and group shows at Macquarie Galleries, the David Jones Art Gallery (of which Duncan was director from 1953 to 1964), the Blaxland Gallery and other venues in Sydney and interstate. She was known for her landscapes, still lifes and particularly her flowerpieces, often executed on hessian and always in a consistently post-impressionist style that employed rhythmic, structured composition, simple forms and a bold yet harmonious use of colour. As a result, Rehfisch was occasionally disparaged by critics who, in thrall to the vigorous, expressionist styles that came to prevail in the post-WW2 period, saw a lack of development or relevance in her work and that of some of her peers. 'These are contemporary painters in the sense that they are still living rather than in the sense that their work is executed in a contemporary idiom', James Gleeson wrote in 1951 of the Contemporary Group's annual exhibition. In 1950, Gleeson described Rehfisch's flowerpieces as being possessed of 'an ability to enthral us with a kind of magic nostalgia.' From the 1960s onwards, she and Duncan lived in Pymble, where Rehfisch painted and taught. Experiencing failing eyesight as well as bouts of severe depression following Duncan's death in 1974, Rehfisch took her own life in March 1975. Like many women artists of her generation, Rehfisch is now recognised as one of the foremost exponents of modernism in Australia, and her work has been included in landmark exhibitions such as Janine Burke's _Australian Women Artists: 100 Years 1840–1940_ (University of Melbourne, 1975) and _The National Women's Art Exhibition_, which consisted of more than 140 exhibitions presented simultaneously at galleries and museum around Australia in 1995. In 2002, the Beagle Press published the monograph _Alison Rehfisch: A life for art_, and the first ever retrospective of Rehfisch's work was presented at the National Trust SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney."

It was then that I really did start to work. He was a wonderful teacher. He realised I was an unconventional, peculiar sort of person really, and he rather encouraged it, not always approving but always sympathetic and helpful. It was there that I met my present husband, who has always been a help to me, with his encouragement and criticism and so on, George Duncan.\\n\\nI worked seriously for years and years and from that day to now I’ve never ceased to paint.\\n\\nWithin the last few years, I’ve been extraordinarily interested in an ecological approach, which is the balance of life and place. I wanted to balance my subjects with something behind it, something deeper behind it. I think my early childhood feelings about trying to get behind things had something to do with it. It’s always been with me, always been interested in the other side of things. But somehow or other it’s terribly difficult to get right behind things, as I think every artist should do. After all, its’ not just a superficial rendering of the things we see in front of us, it’s trying to get the spirit behind all that and join it up with something, another life that isn’t quite only of this world, and I expect I shall go along those lines for quite a while yet.\\n\\nUsually, when I’m painting anything at all, things come to me. I’m slightly psychic, and things come to me in that peculiar period just between waking and sleeping. I see the whole composition, the colour scheme, the feeling of the thing, but I have to work out the detail, of course, physically, myself, afterwards; but the whole general feeling of the thing usually comes to me, and I never start an important work unless that happens because I find it’s never any use at all.",

Born in Dubbo, Riley moved to Sydney in the late 1970s, setting aside his carpentry apprenticeship in 1982 and taking photography courses at Sydney University's Tin Sheds Gallery and the Sydney College of the Arts. Riley and his work became integral to the emerging movement of Indigenous artists working in photography and new media. He was one of the co-founders of the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative in 1987 and exhibited in the groundbreaking Indigenous art exhibitions _Koori Art '84_ at Artspace and _NADOC '86 Exhibition of Aboriginal and Islander Photographers_ at the Aboriginal Artists Gallery. He also worked at Film Australia, where he wrote and directed his first film _Boomalli: Five Artists_ (1988). His first solo exhibition, _Portraits by a Window_, was held at Hogarth Galleries in 1990. In 1991, he achieved international success with his photographs of his mother's Kamilaroi family in Moree, where he grew up. These were echoed in his 1999 series, which centred on his father's Wiradjuri family in Dubbo. His last photographic series, _Cloud_ (2000), was included in the Fourth Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art at the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane and the 2003 Festival of Sydney. His achievements were celebrated in the National Gallery of Australia's 2006 retrospective, _Michael Riley: Sights Unseen_, which toured around Australia. In 2014, the National Portrait Gallery displayed fifteen of Riley's black-and-white photographic portraits, made between 1984 and 1990, representing the vibrant urban-based Indigenous arts community in Sydney."

Born into a philanthropic family in Yarrawonga, Victoria, she attended the selective Sydney Girls' High School and studied medicine at the University of Sydney. After moving to Brisbane, she became superintendent of the Hospital for Sick Children in 1915 and resident medical officer at Brisbane General and Lady Bowen hospitals. Rivett regularly visited Brisbane's brothels as municipal medical officer in charge of the health of licensed prostitutes, and was an early and persistent advocate of birth control and sexual health. Having gained her master's degree in surgery in 1918, from 1919 she practised in Wickham Terrace, where her doctor brother Edward joined her in 1920. (Another brother, Sir David Rivett, was CEO and then Chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which became the CSIRO.) In 1929 Christine Rivett became the first Queensland woman to gain an A-class pilot's licence, and was a foundation member of the Queensland Medical Women's Society. She was also a patron of the arts and a popular figure in the Brisbane art scene. In 1927, Edward Rivett, a devotee of alternative therapies and homeopathy, bought a Walter Burley Griffin house in Castlecrag, Sydney, which he converted to a private maternity hospital. Before the Second World War, Christine Rivett spent some months studying gynaecology and tropical diseases in London and Vienna; after the war, she joined her brother in Castlecrag, practising obstetrics and experimenting in telepathy and ESP. Brother and sister died within a few months of each other."

                    "content": "Tom Roberts (1856–1931), artist, came to Australia from England at the age of 13, but returned eight years later to study art in London. He arrived back in Melbourne in 1885 and established a successful portrait practice. At the same time, he began to paint outdoors with a number of other artists, including Charles Conder and Arthur Streeton, and they came to be known as the ‘Heidelberg School’. In 1889 Roberts was an organiser of, and key participant in, the _9 by 5 Impression Exhibition_ in Melbourne. That year, intent on a series of paintings depicting quintessentially Australian scenes, he travelled from Melbourne to observe the action in the shearing shed on Brocklesby on the Murray near Corowa, New South Wales. There, over a few years he painted _Shearing the rams_ and _A break away_. In 1891 he moved to an artists’ camp at Sirius Cove near Mosman, Sydney; he was to live in the city for twelve years. In 1892 he exhibited some significant portraits. Amongst them were _Eileen_ and _Aboriginal head_ (Charlie Turner), the first two of his pictures to be purchased for the Art Gallery of New South Wales; and also the trio ‘Church State and Law’, portraits of Cardinal Moran, Henry Parkes and Justice William Windeyer. (The location of the portrait of Cardinal Moran is one of Australian art's great mysteries.) Having completed his series of ‘Australian’ pictures with _The Golden Fleece_ and _Bailed Up_ by 1895, in the late 1890s he painted his series on wood panels of eminent Australians, amongst them many musicians and newspapermen; and also the remainder of his great portraits of women. Unsuccessful in his lobbying for the establishment of a national collection of portraits in the newly-federated Australia, he moved to England in 1903. In London, he completed his vast ‘Big Picture’ of the opening of the Australian Parliament, but the project was exhausting, his eyesight dwindled, and he fell into a black period as the success he had hoped for in the old country eluded him. During the First World War he understated his age to work as an orderly at the Third London General Hospital, Wandsworth. He returned permanently to Australia in 1923, settling at Kallista in the Dandenongs. There, he mostly painted small landscapes and flower pieces."

                    "content": "William Robinson AO (b. 1936) is one of Australia's most distinguished and influential contemporary painters, known for his distinctive and prolific output as landscape painter in particular. Born and raised in Brisbane, he trained as a teacher and studied art at the Central Technical College (now Queensland University of Technology) in the 1950s, after which he began a distinguished career as a tertiary art educator in Brisbane and Toowoomba (including at QUT). His painting practice continued alongside his teaching work, and he held his first solo exhibitions in Brisbane in the late 1960s. During the 1970s, following his move with his wife Shirley to a small farm outside Brisbane, he began creating works which were inspired by Bonnard and documented his surroundings, the interiors of his home and the day-to-day life of his growing family. When they moved to a bigger property at Beechmont in the Gold Coast hinterland, he began painting farmyard scenes – witty, merry pictures in which cows, goats, chickens and other animals cavort across the picture plane, often with minimal acknowledgement of realism or perspective. He included self portraits and portraits of Shirley in many of these works. 'Every place that we've ever lived has really affected my work', Robinson has stated. 'My work is a total reflection of my life, and these places have sometimes been difficult but they have been of extreme importance because they have given me an individuality … rather than a recipe which must be followed, or fashion or anything like that. I abhor fashion: I could never become a fashion model and nor could I become a fashionable painter, because I just do what I am.' The move to Beechmont also initiated Robinson's engagement with the landscape, which he likewise began rendering in swirling, increasingly Romantic compositions that dispense with conventional viewpoints, incorporating multiple perspectives instead. Skies, rivers, rainforests and ranges contort and are upended; night and day, summer and winter coincide; trees grow sideways or upside-down; stars collide with the forest canopy and vice-versa. During the same period, Robinson entered the Archibald Prize for the first time with _William and Josephine_ (1984) – a self-portrait with one of his favourite cows. Robinson won the Prize for the first time in 1987 with _Equestrian self portrait_; his second Archibald win came in 1995 with _Self portrait with stunned mullet_ – his final Archibald entry.\\n\\nArt critic John McDonald has written that Robinson 'is the only non-Aboriginal artist since Fred Williams and John Olsen to give us an entirely new view of the Australian landscape.' Twice winner of the Wynne Prize (in 1990 and 1996), Robinson's name has become synonymous with swooping, grand and all-encompassing pictures of gnarled rainforests and deep green mountain ranges, dizzying views of the heavens, and paintings evoking the creation. His work is represented in in each of the major Australian public art museums as well as in prestigious international collections such as those of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the British Museum, London. In 2011, Robinson donated works valued at almost $5 million to the Queensland University of Technology in honour of his longstanding association with the institution as a student and educator. The gift included both of his Archibald-winning self portraits and now forms the basis of the William Robinson Gallery, situated on QUT's Gardens Point campus in Old Government House. Robinson has held numerous solo exhibitions since the late 1960s and his work has been included in a similar number of prestigious group exhibitions. He has represented Australia at the Venice Biennale (in 1990), and the retrospectives of his work – _William Robinson: the revelation of lands_cape (SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney, 2003) and _Darkness and Light: the art of William Robinson_ (QAG, 2001) have toured to venues across the country. Robinson's official honours include an AO, awarded in 2007, and three honorary doctorates."

Robinson was one of the leading Australian printmakers of the 1970s and 1980s. Her screenprints, featuring areas of bold, bright colour, were purchased by public collections throughout Australia and she received many commissions for print series. Her subjects were breezily Australian - the beach, the outback, cockatoos and parrots. In 1999 Robinson made her first appearance in the Archibald Prize as a portrait painter. In 2012 she won the Portia Geach Memorial Award with a portrait of her mother; she won the Shirley Hannan Portrait Prize in 2016 with a painting of Ella Rubeli. The National Portrait Gallery holds portraits by Robinson of Glenn McGrath, Angry Anderson and Tim Winton in the collection."

                    "content": "Robert Rooney (1937-2017), painter, conceptual artist and photographer, studied at Swinburne Technical college from 1954 to 1957. Between 1961 and 1966 he ‘slowly and systematically eliminated the figure’ from his paintings. In between his Slippery seal (1967) and Canine capers (1969) series, in which he used brightly coloured cut-outs on the back of Kellogg’s boxes as stencils, he was represented in The Field. Soon after he made his Superknits series, hard-edged abstractions, ‘absurdly’ based on knitting patterns. He studied at the Phillip Institute from 1972 to 1973; by 1978, his work was the subject of survey exhibitions at the NGV and the Art Gallery of New South Wales; with hindsight, it has become clear that although Rooney’s work ‘employs the visual vocabulary of colour-field painting, it is in fact closer in intent to pop and conceptual art’. From 1980 to 1982 he was art critic for the Age; for the next eighteen years he held the same position at the Australian. Rooney exhibited at Pinocotheca and then Tolarno Gallery between 1960 and 2006. The Monash Univeristy Museum of Art retrospective From the Homefront: Robert Rooney Works 1953-88, held in 1990, was accompanied by a catalogue essay by Philip Brophy. Since then, Rooney’s hand-painted acrylic pictures have been based on illustrations in little-known children’s books or concerned with artworks made by children themselves, though he explains that it is not his aim to draw or paint like a child; rather, his interest is in ‘modern Art (or Modernism) and childhood, or, if you like, the early childhood of Modernism.’ His recent exhibitions at Tolarno include Balletomania (2005) and Le Rire. In 2010-2011 the National Gallery of Victoria presented Endless Present: Robert Rooney and Conceptual Art, featuring Rooney’s photographs in the context of his comprehensive collection of Australian and international conceptual art, much of it gifted to the NGV."

Between 1953 and 1972 Rosewall won four Australian, two French and two US singles championship titles. Coached in Sydney by Harry Hopman, and sardonically nicknamed 'Muscles' on account of his slight stature, he won his first major titles, the Australian and French singles, in 1953 at the age of eighteen. At the close of the 1977 season, aged forty-three, he was still ranked number twelve in the game. Altogether, Rosewall won eighteen major titles in singles, doubles and mixed. He won the US open in 1956 and again in 1970. There were twenty years between the first of his four Wimbledon finals, in 1954, and his last, in 1974. Rosewall turned professional in 1957 and in due course became the second player (after Rod Laver) to earn more than a million dollars from tennis, but the ban on professionals from 1957 to 1967 precluded his participation in many Grand Slam events. Wimbledon was the only big singles title that eluded him, although he won the doubles with Lew Hoad in 1953 and 1956 (in 1968 the Wimbledon men's doubles final was an all-Australian event, with Rosewall and Fred Stolle up against John Newcombe and Tony Roche; the younger men triumphed). In Newcombe's opinion, Rosewall is 'probably the most accurate hitter of the ball that has ever been'. Asked about tennis in 1977 he said 'it's something I enjoy and find I still do well'. Rosewall was inducted into the international Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980, and its Australian counterpart in 1995. In 2008 the centre court of the Sydney Olympic tennis venue was named in his honour."

                    "content": "Marilyn Rowe AM OBE (b. 1946), former prima ballerina, was the first graduate of The Australian Ballet School to become its director. Born in Sydney, Rowe was one of 23 students in the first intake of The Australian Ballet School in 1964. At that time, Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn were guesting with The Australian Ballet, which had formed in 1962. Dame Peggy van Praagh invited Rowe to join the company at the end of 1964 and she was promoted to principal artist in 1969. Four years later, she and Kelvin Coe won silver medals at the Second International Ballet Competition in Moscow. Rowe danced all of the major roles in The Australian Ballet's repertoire and had several works created for her by leading international choreographers, including _Gemini_ (Glen Tetley), _The Merry Widow_ (Ronald Hynd) and _Anna Karenina_ (André Prokovsky). She and Coe performed in New York and London, and became the first Australians to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi, Riga and Vilnius ballet companies. At the end of 1980, while pregnant, Rowe's husband Christopher Maver died in a plane crash. She went into seclusion, but when her son was six months old, in response to demands from the dancers, she returned to the company as an adviser to the artistic director. In 1982 and 1985 she received the Green Room Award for Best Female Dancer. Director of the Dancers' Company from 1984 to 1986, she was on the board of The Australian Ballet from 1994 to 2009, and was Director of The Australian Ballet School from 1999 to 2014. Rowe has produced and directed major contemporary and classical works and received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Australian Dance Awards in 2015."

                    "content": "Kenneth Rowell AM (1920–1999), artist and theatre designer, grew up in Melbourne and became intent on a career in the theatre at a young age. Around the age of thirteen, he left school and found work as a window dresser, spending his spare cash on theatre and his spare time at the National Gallery of Victoria. He began designing backdrops and costumes during the early 1940s, earning his first professional commission in 1947. Awarded a British Council Scholarship in 1950, he moved to London, subsequently working there and in Australia over the next four decades on more than 140 ballet, opera and theatre productions. In the 1960s, he developed a close association with The Australian Ballet, creating designs for productions including _Coppelia_ (1960), _Giselle_ (1965) and _Sleeping Beauty_ (1973), the latter being the first production performed by the company at the Sydney Opera House. In the 1970s, he created the sets and costumes for the ballets of Peter Sculthorpe's _Sun Music_ and _Rites of Passage_, choreographed by Robert Helpmann. At the same time, Rowell developed a considerable reputation as an artist, producing expressionist paintings, mixed media works and sculpture inspired by the Australian landscape. The National Gallery of Australia holds more than 400 examples of his costume design drawings; and in 1999, Opera Australia mounted the retrospective exhibition _Double Act_."

Quite simply I was stagestruck and for a long time that’s really all I wanted to do, I just wanted to work in the theatre, I was mad about the theatre. That seemed enough for a few years, or perhaps for ten years, and then I became terribly conscious of the fact that I was working in a medium that you can never be wholly in charge of as a designer or a producer or a choreographer; you’re one of a number of collaborators working together on a production. And I became more and more interested in the idea of painting because that seemed to me to be something where I could be in charge of a medium and express myself in a way that, much as I love working in the theatre, I would never have that final control about what the statement was. So I started to try and paint and I worked terribly hard. I took myself out of the theatre because I could see that the only way of developing a technique and trying to find a direction as a painter was really to get right out of the theatre for a few years. I did that, and people in the English theatre thought I was mad, but I felt it was something I absolutely had to do.\\n\\nThe paintings I did for the first few years were really not good at all. But I worked very hard, I developed a technique. I simply work in the theatre when I’m offered work that I want to do and when I’m not doing that, I’m up in the studio painting for all I’m worth.\\n\\nI know that this work I do as a painter nourishes all my theatre work, the colours even that I’ve used in the _Sleeping Beauty_ which are very – particularly in the prologue and scenes like that – absolutely strong, chromatic colours I know I don’t see in other theatre. I can only use these because of all I’ve learned as a painter. Anyway, the thing is that both forms of activity now are absolutely necessary to me. People don’t particularly want you to work in two different media but it’s something that I absolutely need.",

                    "content": "Rachel Roxburgh (1915–1991), artist, conservationist and architectural historian, grew up in Sydney's eastern suburbs and studied art at East Sydney Technical College and the Adelaide Perry Art School in the 1930s. She exhibited with the Society of Artists, the Contemporary Group and at the Macquarie Galleries; at the same time, she was a competitive horserider and keen surfer. In 1940, she first exercised what proved to be a formidable skill at fundraising by organising an exhibition in aid of the Journalists and Artists Ambulance Fund. The exhibition featured loaned works by British artists such as Augustus John and Duncan Grant, and locals such as William Dobell, and enabled the purchase of an ambulance for the army's Medical Services division. Roxburgh qualified as a nurse during the war; when it was over she went to London and studied at the Central School of Art. She worked in a number of jobs during her ten years abroad including dressmaking, nursing, creating costumes for the Old Vic Theatre and teaching art as therapy in hospitals. She also took up pottery, which she studied at the Hammersmith School of Arts and Crafts. After returning to Sydney she joined the Potters Society of New South Wales, exhibiting in its first group show at the Macquarie Galleries in 1958. The interior designer Marion Hall Best sold her pots, as did the David Jones Art Gallery. For many years she taught art and pottery at schools including Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School, Abbotsleigh and Ravenswood, and at East Sydney Technical College. From the 1960s onwards she was increasingly involved in built heritage conservation, serving on the council and the executive of the National Trust (NSW) and on its historical and architectural survey committee. Among her many contributions, she was integral to the fundraising for the restoration of Francis Greenway's St Matthew’s Church in Windsor; and she published a number of books on colonial architectural treasures. A committed bushwalker, she held roles with the National Parks Association and the National Parks Advisory Council and campaigned for the preservation of wilderness now contained in the South-East Forests National Park."

                    "content": "Anthony Dattilo Rubbo (1870-1955) was born in Naples and received classical art training in Italy. He arrived in Australia in 1897 having been awarded the title of professor of drawing in public institutions by the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Naples. Over the next couple of years he established himself in Sydney as the major competitor of Julian Ashton. He taught at a number of Sydney private schools and was the most popular instructor at the school of the (Royal) Art Society of New South Wales. At the turn of the century his flat near the Bulletin offices was a meeting place for Sydney's Bohemian community. Grace Cossington Smith, Roland Wakelin and Roi de Maistre were all Rubbo's students, and the first modern paintings in Australia arose from Rubbo's openness to new ideas. He himself, however, eschewed the new movement and continued to produce genre paintings of destitute old men; his more experimental landscapes were the tradition of the French Impressionists rather than their Australian equivalents. Later Rubbo publicly condemned the modern art that he had earlier encouraged. In 1924 he started the Atelier Club and helped to establish the Manly Art Gallery and Historical Collection. He also helped to found the Dante Aligheri Art and Literary Society. He became a life member of the Society of Artists in 1954."

She currently lives in the Larapinta Valley, Northern Territory. Her work has been acquired for major public and private collections, and exhibited across Australia and internationally.\\n\\nMarlene Panankga Rubunjta is the daughter of Wenten Rubuntja, an activist and artist who led the movement that assisted in the development of town camps for Aboriginal peoples living in Alice Springs. He was concerned with the future of his people and advocated for improved living conditions; these town camps were some one of the first formally recognised housing associations, and Yarrenyty Arltere continues as one of the oldest urban Aboriginal settlements. In 1975 Marlene's family, the Rubuntjas, along with the Ebatarinjas and the Namatjiras were the original families to settle Yarrenyty Arltere Town Camp, Larapinta Valley.\\n\\nThe Yarrenyty Arltere Artists centre is a significant place in terms self-determination that has a direct focus on cultural survival, identity, livelihood and both individual and community wellbeing. Like most Aboriginal art centres, Yarrenyty Arltere builds self-esteem, confidence and is concerned with and driven by traditional law and culture. Prior to the establishment of the arts program, the community was gripped by poverty driven crime, substance abuse and violence. This was due to the significant lack of access to mainstream services, with a long-term issue of unemployment and marginalisation in Alice Springs. However, through the implementation of the art centre with a localised art program and cultural governance, the centre emerged as a place of safety, healing, respect and belonging while simultaneously relieving financial stress and living issues. Marlene is one of the senior artists of the Yarrenyty Arltere Artists. Following in the footsteps of her father, she creates artworks that refer to mental health awareness in the desert. She is widely known for her distinct usage of bright colour and pattern work that evoke a sense of happiness and humour, often speaking to the importance of finding joy in everyday life. Marlene learnt how to sew during her schooling at Yirra College (Alice Springs), and has been making soft sculptures since 2009. Her sculptures are created from bush-dyed recycled donated blankets and are embellished with wool, cotton and feathers. Inspiration is drawn from the world around her, life in community and her memories. Her soft sculptures are often informed by her watercolour on paper illustrations. For Marlene, sewing is a source of happiness, healing and self-expression.\\n\\nIn 2016 and 2019 Marlene officially opened the Desert Mob Exhibition in Alice Springs, and in 2017 and 2020 she was one of three judges for the Portrait of a Senior Territorian Art Award. In 2016 Marlene was the overall winner for the inaugural Vincent Lingiari Art Award Alice Springs with her self-portrait titled, _My Future is in my Hands_. Currently she is the president of the Yarrenyty Arltere Housing Association and sits on the Board of Directors for Tangentyere Council."

                    "content": "Jenny Sages (b. 1933), artist, was born to Russian Jewish parents in Shanghai and came to Australia with her family in 1948. After cursory art studies at East Sydney Technical College she attended Franklin School of Art, New York. Having returned to Sydney and married Jack Sages, between 1955 and 1984 she worked as a freelance illustrator and travel writer for books and fashion magazines including _Vogue Australia_. Following a trip to the Kimberley in 1983, Sages decided to become a full-time artist, concentrating on portraits, abstract and landscape works. A specialist in the medium of encaustic wax, delicately coloured with powdered pigments, since 1985 she has worked in a studio atop her home in Carlotta Road, Double Bay; she has had regular solo exhibitions since 1988. Her portrait of Emily Kngwarreye, the first work purchased for the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in 1998, was painted following her annual trips to Central Australia. From 2010 to 2013 an expanded iteration of the National Portrait Gallery exhibition _Jenny Sages: Paths to Portraiture_ toured to Tweed, Toowoomba, Mackay, Burnie and Mosman. Sages won the Portia Geach Award in 1992 and 1994 and the Wynne Prize in 2005, and has been a finalist for the Archibald Prize twenty times (1990, 1993–2009, 2011–2012); her 2000 and 2001 Archibald Prize entries were highly commended by the Trustees and the affecting self-portrait of the artist in widowhood, _After Jack_, was People's Choice in 2012. She last entered the Prize in 2013 with a portrait of Sarah Engledow, which was hung in the Salon des Refusés. The National Portrait Gallery has her portraits of Emily Kngwarreye, Helen Garner, Kate Grenville, Irina Baronova, and Nancy Borlase and Laurie Short. Her solo exhibition, _Lest I forget_, showed at her long-term gallery, King Street Gallery on William, in 2018."

The brothers took up boxing as young men in emulation of their father and a great- uncle, Bailey Russell, who had had some success as a bare-knuckle fighter. They and a sixth brother, Percy, fought under the surname Sands, adopted after a local boxing fan and railway worker who, in 1940, allowed Percy to travel fare-free to a fight.

Clem (1917-1989) held the NSW welterweight title from 1947 to 1951; and Alfie (1929-1985) was the NSW middleweight champion in 1952, 1953 and 1954. Russell (1937-1977) fought a total of 58 professional bouts and won 35 of them; George (1924-1986) won 55 of his 101 fights.

In all, Dave Sands won 97 of his 110 professional bouts. He died, aged 26, when a truck he was driving overturned; at the time of his death, he was rated number three in the world middleweight rankings, behind Americans Sugar Ray Robinson and Jake LaMotta.

Born in Perth with the congenital spine condition myelomeningocele, Sauvage represented Australia for the first time at the age of sixteen, winning gold in a new world record at the IPC World Championships. She sped to public notice at the 1992 Barcelona Paralympic Games, where she won three gold medals and one silver. The only Australian to win gold on the track at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games (with four medals), she lit the flame at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Paralympic Games in 2000, and went on to win two gold medals and one silver. She also won gold in demonstration events at the Atlanta and Sydney Olympics. She has set five world records and gained eleven world championships, and has won the women's wheelchair division of the Boston Marathon four times. Named World Disabled Sportsperson of the Year at the inaugural Laureus international sports awards in 2000, she was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2007, Australian Paralympic Hall of Fame in 2011 and Sport Australia Hall of Fame Legend in 2019. Her autobiography _Louise Sauvage: My Story_ was published in 2002. Sauvage is now a sports coach and motivational speaker, stressing that 'you never know what you can achieve until you try'."

                    "content": "Peter Sculthorpe AO OBE (1929–2014), composer, was born in Launceston and began music lessons around age seven, writing his first compositions by torchlight under the bedclothes at night. He studied at the University of Melbourne from age sixteen. Following a performance of his Sonatina for piano in Germany in 1955, he won a scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford. In 1966, Sculthorpe gained a Harkness Fellowship to study in the USA and later became composer-in-residence at Yale University. Sculthorpe stated in 1998 that, by being overseas, he ‘gained a perspective on what I had left behind at home’; consequently, many of his works explore aspects of Australian landscape, history and Indigenous culture, such as _Irkanda IV_ (1961), _Sun Music I_ and _Sun Music III_ (1965 & 1967), _Port Essington_ (1977) and _Kakadu_ (1988). Others were influenced by Asian traditions and the music of the Pacific. In the late 1960s, Sculthorpe was appointed Reader in Music at the University of Sydney, and he later held a personal chair as its Professor in Musical Composition. An OBE and member of the Order of Australia, Sculthorpe counted being named a National Living Treasure as the most significant of his many honours and awards."

When I listen to music I only hear it with my heart. Of course, it goes through the ears and the brain and so on and so on, but if it moves me, well, that’s all. I don’t want to analyse it. Of course, one has to for students and so on but that’s irrelevant, I just want to soak it in. And that is all, surely, that music is about. And so everything that I write comes from my feelings or my experience of life and of living.\\n\\nIt’s getting started that is the difficulty, and almost always I get started through some, well, feeling in my heart, that sounds vague but it means something to me anyway, or something that I see, even something that I smell, but rarely anything that I hear, oddly enough. Once I’ve got started, I’m right. And I am a slow worker, but then to be a composer it’s just sheer hard work.\\n\\nYou have to forget technique or else you maybe just get beyond it, in a sense be as a kind of sieve, although I don’t believe in spiritualism, shall we say, I’ll use the word medium, in that it comes through you in some way. Because if I am being occupied with the technique, somehow the message just will not get across or the heart thing. It’s very hard to explain, and this is why I can’t really talk about method.\\n\\nI suppose I have lots of little secrets and I suppose that this is why my music always sounds like me, because it has the same faults and the same virtues, if any, whatever kind of piece it may happen to be. This is something that I try to get across to my students, they’ve just got to write and write and write until they can handle notes and juggle them about, and then just forget all about it and abandon themselves to being what they are.",

She is often credited as the pioneer of the artists' practise of repurposing donated mission blankets to create soft sculptures. Inheriting skills passed down through her aunt Dulcie Sharpe, Rhonda predominantly works in textile and printmaking. Known for producing autobiographical works that reflect her life and lived experiences in Alice Springs, Sharpe combines bright colours and intricate detailed patterns that evoke a sense of happiness and joy while often referencing her personal struggle with alcoholism.\\n\\nThe Yarrenyty Arltere Artists centre is a significant place in terms self-determination, one that has a direct focus on cultural survival, identity, livelihood and both individual and community wellbeing. Like most Aboriginal art centres, Yarrenyty Arltere builds self-esteem, confidence and is concerned with and driven by traditional law and culture. Prior to the establishment of the arts program, the community was gripped by poverty driven crime, substance abuse and violence. There was a significant lack of access to mainstream services, with a long-term issue of unemployment due to the marginalisation in Alice Springs. However, through the implementation of the art centre with a localised program and cultural governance, the centre emerged as a place of safety, healing, respect and belonging while simultaneously improving financial stress and living issues.\\n\\nHer first work, notably a memory-informed self portrait, saw Rhonda depicting herself as a child as she didn't have photographs of herself when she was young. The artwork was significant in constructing cultural memories and further its politics, providing Rhonda with a tangible way to remember her life while reflecting the powerful concepts of the past, present and future. This form of memory and concepts of time highlight the non-linear narrative and cyclic nature of time and space within First Nations knowledge systems.\\n\\nSharpe's work is held in major public collections across Australia; she has exhibited extensively in Australia, and her work has been shown internationally. Since 2012 she has regularly been a finalist in the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, winning the Wandjuk Marika 3D Memorial Award in 2013 and 2015; in 2021 Sharpe won the 20th Anniversary Woollahra Small Sculpture Prize."

She won the Sulman Prize in 1986, and the same year was awarded a residency at the Cité, Paris; in 1989 she won the Mercedes Benz Scholarship to travel to the Middle East and Italy. Between 1990 and 1999 she won the Waverley Art Prize, the Robert Le Gay Brereton Drawing Prize, the Portia Geach Prize, the Kedumba Drawing Prize, the Bathurst Art Prize and the Archibald Prize; she won the Portia Geach Prize again in 2003 and gained another residency at the Cité in 2006. Meanwhile, in 1998-1999 the City of Sydney commissioned her to paint eight enormous murals for at the Olympic Pool at the Cook and Phillip Aquatic Centre and the Australian War Memorial appointed her as an Official Artist attached to the Australian Army History Unit in Dili, East Timor. Her more recent residencies and associations have included one at Taronga Zoo in 2011, one in Antarctica in 2012, one with Circus Oz in 2015-2016 and one at the State Library of New South Wales in 2018. Renowned for her richly-coloured, carnivalesque and variously-perspectived works, she is particularly interested in the curvaceous, voluptuous forms of dancers, acrobats, drag artists and burlesque performers and the effects of stage, street and domestic lighting. The book _Wendy Sharpe_ was published in 2011 to coincide with the artist's retrospective exhibition, _Wendy Sharpe: The imagined life_ at the SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney.With more than 1500 dedicated Facebook followers, Sharpe divides her years between Sydney and Paris, where she has homes and studios."

He studied art at East Sydney Technical College, and during WWII worked at the Commonwealth Aircraft factory painting camouflage with William Dobell and Joshua Smith. After the war he worked as a designer and illustrator. In 1939 he had established a printing press with Dick Edwards, and after the war Edwards and Shaw were instrumental in ending the censorship of four letter words in Australia, by publishing the banned report of the trial of Penguin books over Lady Chatterley's Lover. He designed the mural for the Waterside Workers' Federation Office and for many years taught at workshops and summer schools. He was a foundation member of Artists for Democracy and of Artists Against Nuclear War. Shaw had a major retrospective show at Woolloomoolloo Gallery in 1988 and is represented in the Art Gallery of NSW and the National Gallery of Victoria as well as the Australian War Memorial."

So, we called ourselves social realists. It was actually a left-wing tendency. This occurred, we found out later, in England, America and right throughout the English-speaking world, at any rate. In our group there were people like Roy Dalgarno, James Cant, Hal Missingham was later on involved, and we had quite a thriving movement and a school, ran classes and so on, exhibitions each year.\\n\\nAt the time, of course, there was a lot of, not exactly antagonism towards us but an unwillingness to accept the realist attitude, as we propounded it. It was rather dubbed as propaganda painting, and to a certain extent it was, as we always claimed that all art was propaganda of some sort, even it was propaganda for beautiful pansies or animals or whatever it might be. But I think we had a lot of rather half-baked ideas about social realism. Looking back on it, I don’t think we really knew what it was, in fact I’ve come to believe that there’s no such thing as a cut and dried social realism. Our impetus was to say something, to protest about things, to use our painting as a language; although we loved the language for its own sake, we felt that if we had a language we should speak with it, and not just reflect and be an image of the passing parade and so on.",

Largely self-taught at first, he eventually studied at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, where he became strongly influenced by his teacher Shangyi, China’s most famous portraitist. Shen became a specialist in history paintings, many of which he produced for public collections. One picture, however – a depiction of heroes of the Chinese nationalist movement – necessitated his departure from China in 1989. His wife, artist Lan Wang, was pregnant when he left; it was two years before they were reunited in Sydney, where Shen met their daughter Xini for the first time. Having started out making sketches of passers-by at Darling Harbour, Shen is now a much sought-after portraitist, a regular Archibald finalist and has created work for clients such as the Vatican and Parliament House. He has painted commissions of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Tom Hughes KC and L Gordon Darling AC CMG for the National Portrait Gallery. 'There are two sides to my work,' he explains. 'When I came here I was nothing … so any commission was very exciting. But for a long time now, I've been interested in making paintings that show the big things: the world, history, great men.' To make a picture such as _The Third World_ 2002, depicting 92 identifiable contemporary and historical figures, he spends months in the library, as well as in his studio. He has no plans to return to China, commenting that ‘When I go back I see the worst of communism and the worst of capitalism.' Shen and Wang both live and work in Bundeena, south of Sydney."

                    "content": "Ivy Shore (1915–1999), painter, was born in Melbourne, daughter of a South Australian suffragette, Elka, and engineer John Williams. After her father died in 1919, the family relocated to Adelaide. She trained as a seamstress before marrying a financier, Ray Shore, and moving to Sydney. Bored, she enrolled in painting classes with Graeme Inson, a disciple of Max Meldrum's. Separating from her husband in 1960, she bought a house in Ocean Street, Woollahra and in 1962, soon after Shore was widowed, Inson moved in. Through the 1960s Shore continued to develop her artistic skills under Inson, and he in turn eventually dubbed her 'my greatest student'. She first entered the Portia Geach competition in 1976; she won it in 1979 with a portrait of Della Elliott, now in the National Portrait Gallery collection. Inson was so irritated by the style of the portrait – a departure from the Meldrum method – that he went to live in his studio, but he returned home after a week. Shore used her prize money to have a studio built by architect Peter Moffitt above the garage of her house, and painted there out of sight of Inson. Over the coming years Shore continued to exhibit in the Portia Geach award, winning Most Highly Commended three times, and the Royal Easter Show Art Prize Exhibition. In 1993, she created her last painting _Influences_, a tribute to the five people who had most influenced her, depicting Henry Hanke, Robert Haines, Justin O’Brien and Lloyd Rees at a dinner table, Inson holding forth with a glass of wine in hand. This painting now hangs in The Dundee Arms Hotel in Sydney, where Inson once had a studio, alongside Inson's favourite of his own portraits of Shore. Her work is included in many galleries and private collections in Australia, UK and France."

                    "content": "Arnold Shore, a lifelong inhabitant of Melbourne, was apprenticed to a stained glass and leadlight company called Brooks, Robinson soon after leaving school at the age of twelve. He worked there for more than twenty years, and there, he met his lifelong friend, artist Jock Frater. For five years before World War 1 he trained at the NGV School under Frederick McCubbin, but left before completing his qualifications, transferring to the tuition of Max Meldrum until 1923. Meanwhile, he read up on modern European art when he got the chance. Over the 1930s he developed a reputation for flower studies before turning to the bush, which became a favourite subject. He exhibited with the Twenty Melbourne Painters’ Society, a breakaway group from the dominant Victorian Artists’ Society, from 1923 to 1946. In 1932, with the older and wealthier George Bell, an established art critic, he founded the Bell-Shore School. Bell had been classically trained; as Shore put it, ‘Bell’s training and experience was balanced by my enthusiasm and sense of art . . . He generally trusted to logic. I depended on feeling.’ The school quickly became an important influence on the development of Melbourne modernism but tensions developed between the founders and the partnership dissolved in 1936. In 1935 HV ‘Doc’ Evatt and his wife Mary Alice gave Shore his first portrait commission (amongst the first works acquired for the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in 1998). The National Gallery of Victoria first purchased one of Shore’s works in 1937, and for some years he gave annual lectures there about modern art. From that time, his works were purchased by state galleries in Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney, and he also found himself increasingly teaching, lecturing, critical reviewing and judging art prizes. He won the Crouch prize in 1938. Shore’s career was at its high through much of the 1940s, when he lived at Mount Macedon and painted rich and distinctive views of the bush. By the spring of 1949 he had had six solo shows in Melbourne, the National Gallery of Victoria had five of his works and the Art Gallery of Western Australia had bought one of his paintings. In the 1950s, however, he painted very little. Throughout his life the artist endured periods of suicidal depression and anxiety, which were addressed with shock treatment and the prototype medications of the day. Shore was art critic for the _Argus_ and the _Age_. In 1957, Tam and Anne Purves held the first major retrospective of his works – nearly a hundred of them - at their new Australian Galleries; both Alan McCullough and John Brack declared his significance. In 1960 and 1961 he was president of the Victorian Artists’ Society, which awarded him its medal of honour. In 1962 he was one of six Australian painters represented in a touring exhibition through Victoria, curated by James Mollison for the National Gallery of Victoria. However, by that time, the Angry Penguins were the fashionable artists of the day. Estranged from his wife and having to sell assets to afford a home, he plunged into melancholy that waxed and waned until he died of natural causes in the autumn of 1963. Shore is represented in all major Australian galleries. Much of this information is taken from _Arnold Shore: Pioneer Modernist_ by Rob Haysom."

I might be going to a shop to buy something to eat or to get a drink, or I might be going to meet somebody. But as a painter you’re always looking at things, a big percentage of your time anyway, if not always, you’re looking at things with a painter’s eye. You’re noticing the colours and the shapes and the textures that you see about you. You also – you’re not lacking in humanity – you also notice people, that people look sad or sick or happy and so on, when you see them. You see a drunk and you step out of his way if you think he’s going to be pugnacious, and so on, or you laugh at him if he’s just happy. But as a painter you look for these colours and these shapes, and you’re thinking of your job. It might sound awful to talk about painting as a job, but it is a job just like anything else.\\n\\nAnd another thing, I’m breaking in on myself, but I believe that a cricketer or a footballer or a golf player, that they are when they’re at the best, that they’re in the same position as the artist; they’re using their knowledge and their skill and their feeling to do something. There is a difference: the golfer when he dies, he’s dead except in the memory of people who remember that he won a certain competition or that he put up some record round, but he doesn’t leave anything behind him except that. The artist if he’s lucky, and the world’s lucky, does leave things behind him and there’s a peculiar quality about a work of art, is that once it’s created by a man who combines knowledge and feeling – it doesn’t matter whether he’s a primitive, a caveman, an Aboriginal artist in the bush, or a painter in a studio in one of the great cities of the world, a Rembrandt or a Velasquez – once they create a work of art that really is a work of art, it never loses its quality. Art doesn’t progress; it changes.\\n\\n ",

He arrived in Australia from England in 1948 at fifteen, having studied at the Gravesend School of Art in Kent. Associated with artist Jon Molvig, he became a key member of the Brisbane School and held his first exhibition in 1960. In 1961, he exhibited at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. The following year his work was included in an exhibition at the Tate Gallery and he won the Transfield Art Prize, then Australia's richest art award. In the 1960s and 1970s his work was included in exhibitions in Japan, USA, Paris and Germany. Sibley moved to Melbourne in 1966 and was a lecturer in Fine Arts at RMIT until 1990, when he became Head of Painting at Monash University. Throughout his career he exhibited regularly and is represented in most major Australian galleries. His portraits of Molvig, Mirka Mora and Alan McCulloch were finalists in the Archibald Prize, and he was a finalist in the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize with his works of his wife Irene Sibley and Rodney Hall. Drawing was an essential part of Sibley's practice, and the National Portrait Gallery has eighteen of the artist's portraits in pencil and ink."

                    "content": "Jeffrey Smart (1921–2013) was an iconic realist painter, acclaimed for his urban and industrial landscapes which form one of the most original and recognisable bodies of work in the canon of Australian art. He created a distinctive style that captured the stillness and alienation of the industrialised world with metaphysical nuance and a refined, crisp clarity of vision. Born in Adelaide in 1921, Smart studied part-time at the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts under Marie Tuck and Rupert Bunny in the late 1930s. Influenced by modernist artist Dorrit Black, Smart acquainted himself with the 'Golden Mean', a ratio used to create mathematically-sound proportions that translated into artistic composition. This geometric proportion ratio has been used since ancient Greek times in many works of art and architecture. Smart used the complex network of interlocking rectangles, triangles and diagonals to calculate the structure of his paintings and form the basis of all of his artworks.\\n\\nSmart began exhibiting in group shows in the early 1940s and had his first solo exhibition in Melbourne in 1944, opened by Robert Menzies. In 1948, Smart travelled to England via the United States. He then went to Paris and studied at the Grande Chaumière before attending the Académie Montmartre, studying under Fernand Leger for six months. Throughout this period he travelled in Europe with Australian friends including Michael Shannon, Jacqueline Hick, Donald Friend and Margaret Cilento. His travels allowed Smart the opportunity to view and study the work of artists he admired – in particular Paul Cezanne, Piero della Francesca, Rogier van der Weyden, Giovanni Bellini, and Titian. On returning to Australia in 1951, Smart settled in Sydney where he lived, worked and exhibited for the next twelve years. During this period, he also worked as an art critic for the _Daily Telegraph_, as a life drawing teacher at Easy Sydney Technical College, and as the arts correspondent for the ABC children's radio programme the _Argonauts Club_. In 1964, Smart moved to Italy, initially living in Rome before settling in Arezzo, Tuscany in the early 1970s, and he remained there until his death in 2013.\\n\\nDespite his relocation to Tuscany, Smart continued to exhibit in Australia where he enjoyed ongoing popular and critical success. During the 1960s, Smart became increasingly dedicated to the representation of the modern city. Each painting was executed with classical precision and included repetitious architectural motifs which reference and were influenced by the flat perspective of Renaissance painting and frescoes. He saw beauty in everyday scenes, choosing to paint highways, factories, trucks, billboards, carparks and vacant city lots in compositions characterised by the play of the shapes, light, shadow and geometry of the urban environment. He once said of his subjects: 'Perhaps I'm trying to help people see the beauty in a gas tank, a road divider, a yellow truck. I paint buildings, factories, freeways, satellite dishes, because I like the definite forms and clean shapes.'"

After the war, he recommenced study at RMIT under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Training Scheme. Smith and his wife Joy moved to Sydney in 1952, and he found work as a window cleaner at David Jones’s. When he won his first Blake Prize for religious art in 1956, the _Sun_ reported that ‘window cleaner Eric Smith took only an hour to paint the Scourged Christ.’ Characterised as a ‘battler’, he initially painted in the bedroom he and Joy shared. In 1958 he, Joy and their children moved to Small St, Woollahra. Smith was to win the Blake prize five more times up to 1970. Notable for experimenting with diverse art styles, he also won the Wynne Prize twice, and the Sulman Prize in 1953, 1973 and 2003. In 1963, when he was in London to see his work hung in the Tate exhibition of Australian art, he received the Helena Rubenstein Art Award. \\n\\nEric Smith first entered the Archibald Prize with a strong self-portrait in 1944. He won the Prize in 1970, 1981 and 1982 with portraits of architect Neville Gruzman, art dealer Rudi Komon and composer Peter Sculthorpe respectively. The prize for the portrait of Komon survived a challenge from an artist who’d been stripped of the Archibald five years earlier for painting from a photograph. Smith acknowledged that he used photographs, but he also knew Komon, and had had multiple sittings with him. Smith’s paintings are in the collections of the National Gallery, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Queensland Art Gallery. Working almost until his death, he was the subject of a television documentary, _Not Finished Yet_, in 2012."

I have no real reason; I cannot explain why it seems necessary for me to get straight to the board, but I’ve always found it so. I’ve many times said to myself that I was going to do a lot of drawings, but I no sooner start than I move across to the prepared board.\\n\\nSometimes I have a particular subject in mind, religious or otherwise, but most often than not I just start painting. This seems necessary for me, to just let the thing grow, to really try and find out about myself, let the thing happen, and as the forms appear on the canvas they suggest something to me, something perhaps to do with a subject matter, and if the forms seem dynamic enough, things are working and exciting level and I push that thing on to a particular subject matter.\\n\\nIt is so hard today, we have nothing to hang our hat onto, and it’s a case of really digging down deep to find out about yourself. You take a risk here that you won’t be understood.\\n\\nI have always been concerned with the human condition, whether the tragedy or aspirations of man. And everywhere new relationships are springing up which must be felt and explored, and in this way, I must create my own language to express the depth of my feelings about these things.",

During the war, Smith worked in a camouflage unit with fellow artist William Dobell. In January 1944 Dobell's portrait of Smith was awarded the Archibald Prize for 1943. A law case ensued, with the artist complainants alleging that Dobell's work was a caricature of his friend. The court found that it was a good likeness. The trial was inevitably distracting, embarrassing and debilitating for Dobell and Smith, but the following year Smith rallied to win the Archibald himself, for a portrait of HS Rosevear. Dobell's portrait of Smith was badly damaged in a fire in 1958, but it has since been restored. Smith painted several memorable portraits, including one of Dame Mary Gilmore and a haunting study of his parents acquired by the Art Gallery of NSW in 1943. He was a regular exhibitor in the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes for many years."

If I remember correctly, I asked for about 15 sittings. Being the first official portrait that I’d been given from the Government I was rather a bit scared, you know. Anyway, Mr Rosevear was very co-operative, and it eventually won the Archibald, so, quite good!\\n\\nNow with my own procedure as regards portrait painting, that has varied considerably over the years. At one stage, I used to make a small drawing, say about 15 inches deep, in pencil, and more in the nature of a very accurate map, and then work from that; but later I found that I prefer to draw straight onto the canvas with charcoal, just dust that off and then paint direct. And I also like to have my sitter in front of me the whole time.\\n\\nNow I’ve been asked to say something about Chips Rafferty’s portrait and how I did it. Well that was painted out in the open in the lawn in his backyard. I had a good many sittings. I remember Chips saying to me, ‘You’ve worn a track across my lawn, running backwards and forwards!’. I like to have my canvas right alongside my subject and get back from it to make my observations as far as possible.\\n\\nNow I’ve been asked about any particular highlights in my life. Well, I think one of the most important things that I can remember is my first sale of a drawing. And it was a little drawing of my mother, a pencil drawing of my mother playing the piano. And we had it in the Julian Ashton School sketch club. And I was sitting next to the late Julian Ashton and Julian turned to me and said, ‘Would you take half a guinea for it?’. I said ‘Sold!’.",

In 1968 he became the youngest artist ever to win the Sulman Prize; and held his first solo exhibition at Australian Galleries, Melbourne in 1969. In the 1970s he went several times to paint in central and outback Australia, variously accompanying Grant Mudford and Wesley Stacey, John Olsen, Vincent Serventy and Stuart Purves. In 1983 he held his first solo exhibition in London, from which three works were purchased by MOMA New York. In 1984, when he won the Sulman again, he visited Egypt on commission from the West Australian businessman Sir Garrick Agnew; the exhibition Tickets to Egypt at AGNSW and AGWA resulted. A long-term resident of Bathurst, New South Wales, Storrier has been included in many group exhibitions and is represented in the National Gallery of Australia and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The judges of the 2012 Archibald prize were split between awarding the prize to Tim Storrier or Jenny Sages, both of whom had painted self-portraits; ultimately, the prize went to Storrier for his Bosch-inspired work The histrionic wayfarer."

                    "content": "David Strachan (1919–1970), painter and printmaker, was educated at Geelong Grammar School and then studied art at the Slade School in London. After a period of travel in France and further study at the Académie de la Grand Chaumière, he returned to Australia, enrolling at George Bell’s school in Melbourne before moving to Sydney in 1941. He exhibited landscapes, figurative works and still lifes and became one of the group of artists who travelled regularly to the abandoned New South Wales mining town of Hill End. After World War II, during which he worked as a camouflage painter at Bankstown aerodrome and performed minor roles with Hélène Kirsova’s ballet company, Strachan returned to Europe, living in Paris and then London and studying at the CJ Jung-Institut in Zurich in the late 1950s. Back in Sydney from 1960, he bought a Paddington terrace house, spurring his close friend, Margaret Olley, to purchase a house nearby; she often painted at his home, and used it as a studio after he died. During the 1960s Strachan taught at East Sydney Technical College and exhibited regularly, winning the Wynne Prize in 1961 and 1964. In the mid-1960s, too, he was the executor of the estate of Godfrey Miller and became president of the Society of Artists. In 1966 the National Gallery of Victoria held a survey exhibition, _Four Sydney Painters_, showing works by Strachan, Donald Friend, Justin O’Brien and Jeffrey Smart. In late 1970, just as he was beginning to feel ‘contemporary’ and that his best work was still to come, Strachan died as the result of a car accident in Yass. Daniel Thomas curated the exhibition _David Strachan 1919-1970_ at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1973. Lou Klepac’s _David Strachan_ with an introduction by Barry Pearce and an essay by John McDonald accompanied a touring exhibition of Strachan’s work in 1993. The National Portrait Gallery acquired Strachan’s portrait of Kenneth Rowell through the intervention of Margaret Olley in 2002. The Tweed Regional Art Gallery and Margaret Olley Studio mounted the exhibition _The mystery of things: Margaret Olley and David Strachan_ in 2016."

Becoming interested in women's issues in her twenties, in the interwar years she intervened in unemployment relief, the plight of Jewish refugees, and Indigenous rights. She stood unsuccessfully as a Labor Party candidate in the federal elections of 1939 and 1946; in between, in 1945, she was the sole Australian woman delegate to the founding of the United Nations, where she pressed for women's rights. Street first visited Russia in 1938, and was president of the Australian Russian Society from 1946; as the Cold War developed, she was (falsely) accused of communist sympathies. In 1949, expelled from the Labor party, she stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate. Street's husband, Sir Kenneth Street, was Chief Justice of NSW from 1950, and for much of the 1950s she worked for the World Peace Council in London. Her son, Laurence, became Chief Justice of New South Wales in 1974."

After all, the trade union movement is supposed to represent both the men and the women in jobs. There must be amongst their membership, the same number of intelligent women as there are intelligent men. And I would very much hope to see in the future – I don’t suppose it’ll come in my lifetime – that they have the proper distribution of places of influence between men and women both in the governing bodies of unions, and also, later on, when things gets more socialistic, in the governing body of the industries themselves.\\n\\nNow I say, ‘get more socialistic’, there because many years ago I became a socialist. I read quite a lot of books about politics and so on and so forth, and it seemed to me to be the system under which the individual, whether a man or a woman, had the greatest opportunity of developing their usefulness and status. You only have to look back in history in the days of serfdom and all the rest of it. It’s as they’ve gradually overcome the limitations that were placed on them by the social system, that not only women have advanced but society itself has advanced. And of course, if you come to think of it, men and women are both components of society and if you have a horse with a lame foot or a shackled foot it’s not going to gallop was well as one that hasn’t got, who hasn’t got any shackles on. And it’s the same with the human race – if you’re going to shackle the women, as they have been in the past and to a certain extent still are, you’re going to hold up the progress of the whole of our society.",

                    "content": "Mark Strizic (1928-2012) was born in Berlin and migrated to Australia via Croatia in 1950. His early interests were in painting and science, but in 1957 he took up photography as a career. Just 10 years later he exhibited a collection of photographic portraits titled Some Australian Personalities at the National Gallery of Victoria. The first photographic artist to be given a solo exhibition at the NGV, he was also the first photographer to be acquired by the fledgling National Gallery of Australia, in March 1973. During this period, Strizic's interest in art and architecture led to close associations with leading figures from both professions. His collaboration with painter Clifton Pugh on the book Involvement (1968) furnished an important snapshot of the creative talents and personalities of Australia of that time. Two years later he collaborated with architect Robin Boyd on the book Living in Australia. In his career Strizic undertook industrial, advertising, architectural and portrait photography, with commissions for government, companies, and private individuals as well as the United Nations. Mark Strizic: A Journey in Photography, a retrospective exhibition organised by Monash Gallery of Art showcasing 50 years of Mark Strizic's work across a wide range of photographic fields including urban, industrial, commercial, and architectural photography was exhibited at the NPG at Old Parliament House from September to November 2004."

In 1969 she was one of five women involved in founding the Women's Liberation Movement group in Adelaide. She then moved to Sydney and in 1973 was part of a cooperative that established Australia’s first refuge for victims of domestic violence, Elsie. For her doctorate at the University of Sydney, Summers wrote her first book, _Damned Whores and God's Police_ (1975), a landmark text in Australian feminism that has sold over 100,000 copies. As a journalist for _The National Times_ she investigated NSW prisons, which led to a royal commission and a Walkley Award for Summers in 1976. She then worked as a political correspondent for the _Australian Financial Review_. Appointed head of the Office for the Status of Women in 1983, Summers was instrumental in the passage of the Anti-Discrimination Act; in the 1990s she worked as an adviser to Prime Minister Paul Keating. In New York from 1986 to 1992, Summers was editor-in-chief of _Ms_ magazine; and later edited the _Good Weekend_. Deputy President of Sydney's Powerhouse Museum from 1999, she also chaired the board of Greenpeace International from 2000. Her autobiography, _Ducks on the Pond_, was published in 1999; and her book _The Lost Mother: A Story of Art and Love_ (2010) was shortlisted for the Victorian Premier's Literary Awards. In 2013 she published _The Misogyny Factor_, an analysis of the status of women in contemporary Australia. Her memoir _Unfettered and Alive_ was published in 2018. Based in New York, Summers is a columnist for the _Sydney Morning Herald_."

She is probably the best-known Utopia artist after her late aunt, Emily Kame Kngwarreye. Petyarre first gained recognition for her batiks, exhibiting from 1977 with the Utopia Women's Silk Batik Group. Although she only began painting in acrylics on canvas in the late 1980s, since her first solo exhibition in 1991 she has had a dedicated following of public and private collectors in Australia and internationally. Using layers of tapering dots, dashes and swirling lines, her many paintings portray Awelye (women's ceremonies and body paint designs) and various Dreamings, including the Mountain Devil Lizard and her signature, Bush Medicine Leaves. Petyarre was awarded the Wynne Prize at the Art Gallery of NSW in 1999 for one of her _Leaves_ works, the first Aboriginal artist to receive this coveted award for landscape painting. She retired in 2019 due to health issues."

Born in Darwin, she attended dance schools in Melbourne, Penang and Sydney before being accepted into the Australian Ballet School in 1973. After joining the Australian Ballet in 1975, she then worked as a soloist with Pina Bausch's dance theatre in Wuppertal, Germany between 1978 and 1984. As a freelance choreographer, she established her distinctive choreography in works such as _Two Feet_ (1988) and was commissioned for projects in France, the Netherlands and Germany.

After contracting polio at the age of twelve while living in New Zealand, she spent several years in rehabilitation; it took two years for her to walk unassisted. After moving back to Sydney, she started spearfishing and free diving at her parent's Sydney waterfront home, later becoming an Australian champion in spearfishing and scuba. In the late 1950s she met Ron Taylor, a world and Australian spearfishing champion. They gave the sport away once they realised that photographing sharks was a vastly more rewarding pursuit than killing them. The couple married in 1963, by which time their first major documentary _The Shark Hunters_ had been sold to Australian and American television. They formed their own production company in 1969, the year they were consultants for the US feature film _Blue Water, White Death_. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s they made and provided footage for numerous films and television programs, among them _Wild, Wild World of Animals_ (1973–78) and _Blue Wilderness_ (1992); and in 1974 they filmed the live shark underwater scenes for the Steven Spielberg blockbuster _Jaws_. Both were also vigorous and successful campaigners for marine conservation legislation; and the recipients of many prestigious awards for environmental work and underwater photography, their images appearing in magazines such as National Geographic and Time. Since Ron's death in 2012, Valerie has continued to dive and advocate for marine conservation. Her memoir, _An Adventurous Life_, was launched in 2019. A documentary on Valerie, _Playing with Sharks_, released in 2021, celebrates her 50-year career."

She began training with the great Russian teacher Olga Preobrajenska, formerly of the Imperial Russian Ballet, at age ten after her family emigrated to Paris from Bessarabia, Romania. Noticed by choreographer George Balachine, at seventeen she joined the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. Tchinarova came to Australia on the first and second tours of the Russian ballets in 1936 and 1938, and chose to remain in Sydney after the second tour. In 1943 she married the actor Peter Finch, who had recently made his film debut in _Dad and Dave Come to Town_. During the 1940s she danced with three Australian dance companies, the Kirsova Ballet, the Polish-Australian Ballet and the Borovansky Ballet. In 1948, Finch and Tchinarova moved to London before divorcing in 1959. She then began working as a Russian/English interpreter for touring ballet companies, including the Australian Ballet, and as a dance writer. Tchinarova came back to Australia for the last time in 1994 as a guest of The Australian Ballet, delivering a series of lectures. Her autobiography, _Dancing into the Unknown: My Life in the Ballets Russes and Beyond_, was published in 2007. She died ten years later in Marbella, Spain at the age of 98."

Born in Melbourne, Thorley painted from the age of nine. As a teenager, he won the Herald Art Prize and gained a scholarship to the National Gallery School, where his teachers included WB McInnes. In the 1950s and 1960s he had a studio in Olinda in the Dandenongs; in 1965, declaring that he would not paint any more, he took up a cattle station (Donngan) in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Having survived cancer, in 1970 he moved back to Victoria, to Balranald, where he ran cattle and horses and began painting again, converting the town's old Masonic Hall into a studio. In 1980 he moved with his horses to Trentham, where he bought a Catholic school, relocated it and turned it into two studios, one for teaching and one for his own use."

A long-term resident of Mosman, Toovey frequently exhibited landscapes in the Wynne Prize, and she was an Archibald finalist thirty-four times though she never won the Prize. She won the Portia Geach Memorial Award in 1970 with a self-portrait in a landscape, and 1978 with a portrait of Neville Bonner. The Art Gallery of New South Wales has a landscape, the 1970 self-portrait, and her portrait of Roy Fluke (1961)."

His expressionistic style of painting was formed during the wartime years, when the city of Melbourne took on a strange and unreal atmosphere. His first major series of paintings, collectively titled Images of Modern Evil, was painted between 1945 and 1947. Tucker lived in Europe and the United States throughout the 1950s. There he refined and extended his subjects, concentrating on Australian myths, which he saw as central to the definition of national identity. Although best known as a painter, Tucker was an enthusiastic photographer. He took many of the now-familiar photographs of Melbourne's artistic circles of the 1940s."

I think it’s answering an inner compulsion, because if I didn’t find this particular form of activity – to me it’s one that is defining things to myself and defining myself – I’m not quite sure what would happen to me if I didn’t answer this kind of inner compulsion. And I suppose it relates to one’s attitude to life. I think that, despite all the negative and destructive powers that are constantly at work with us, that one is constantly striving to affirm life, to be in love with it, and these are the tokens of affection on our way, as it were.\\n\\nThe question of why I paint the particular things I do is also pretty ambiguous. I think I would say that I’m trying to exorcise my own particular devils, and I suppose some of them get into the painting. I hope they do, that’s where I’m trying to put them, and get rid of them.\\n\\nBut once out, of course, one can then feel this kind of relaxation, the affirmation flows in, and the devils in the painting can sometimes turn into angels.\\n\\nI suppose in the act of work that it is essentially a struggle to escape the enmeshment of one’s ego, and in the attempt to struggle free one seems externally, to the external world, to be a very egocentric person, because you’re following a necessary compulsion without which one loses one’s own balance and direction in life; and in the act of working one is defining these shapes, ejecting them as it were, and getting rid of them; and this process of ejectment is one there which is defining and clarifying one’s own particular kind of energy which you are attempting to flow out into life.",

He was amongst the first troops to land at Gallipoli, where he was wounded; in 1918, serving on the Western Front, he was wounded again. After the war he returned to Sydney to pursue his vision of establishing successful commercial airlines, and proved a capable and energetic administrator. When he co-piloted the Southern Cross from California to Brisbane, he had not yet obtained a pilot's licence. However, he went on to make several more record-breaking flights, both with Kingsford Smith in Southern Cross, and in command of his own aircraft, Faith in Australia. Ulm's Airspeed Envoy Stella Australis went down in the sea between California and Hawaii. His body was never found."

                    "content": "Danila Vassilieff, born in Russia, arrived in Australia in the early 1920s having served in a Cossack cavalry regiment, been captured by Communist forces and escaped via Persia and India to China. In the early 1930s he lived for two years in Rio, where he trained in art and exhibited; he showed his work in the Caribbean, the UK, and Spain and Portugal before returning to Australia in 1936. Here, in time, he built a house at Warrandyte, Victoria called Stonygrad, and taught painting and sculpture (Ken Whisson was one of his students). Vassilieff’s fresh style and his interest in child art significantly influenced Nolan, Boyd, Blackman, Perceval and others; recently, it has been claimed that his work was ‘a crucial trigger for Nolan’s Kelly series’. Having established his reputation with pictures of children playing in the streets of Collingwood, Fitzroy and East Melbourne, in the late 1930s and early 1940s he was art teacher at the experimental school at Warrandyte. In the early 1950s he began stone-carving using Lilydale limestone, with which no one else had been able to succeed. Late in his life he taught art at high schools in Mildura, Swan Hill and Eltham, but ultimately he was dismissed by the Department of Education. John and Sunday Reed owned many of his paintings; their adopted son, Sweeney, named one of his own children Danila. Vassilieff died of heart failure at the Reeds’ property, Heide. \\n\\nVassilieff was the subject of a commemorative exhibition at Joseph Brown Gallery in Melbourne in 1973 and his work has since featured in many group retrospectives. A revised and expanded edition of Felicity St John Moore’s book _Vassilieff and His Art_ (1982) was published in 2012, coinciding with the exhibition _Danila Vassilieff: A New Art History_ at Heide. The National Gallery of Victoria has eighteen of his works; the National Gallery of Australia has many more, including his _Expulsion from Paradise_ screen, his _Peter and the Wolf_ series and many drawings."

In 1976, the couple was appointed to lead the Dance Company New South Wales (later the Sydney Dance Company) and they put together their first production, Poppy. Throughout their careers she has been Murphy’s muse and collaborator, able to see the full sweep of a production and ensure its parts worked together while he concentrated on details. In the early years they often danced together; later, she danced with the company throughout the world, in roles and productions they had created together. In 1996 she was named amongst Australia’s top five female dancers of all time (along with Marillyn Jones, Marilyn Rowe, Kathleen Gorham and Lucette Aldous). In 2000 Murphy and Vernon celebrated their achievements in Body of Work: A retrospective. Two years later they put together a unique Swan Lake. They married in 2004, and in 2009 choreographed the film Mao’s Last Dancer. Vernon and Murphy retired from the Sydney Dance Company in 2007 but the couple has continued to create works for Chinese, German and Australian companies."

                    "content": "James Richard Vickery OBE (1902-1997), food scientist, saw the field of his life’s research grow from non-existence to world recognition. Vickery graduated in biochemistry from the University of Melbourne in 1925, and fours year later earned a PhD from Cambridge, where he worked in the Low Temperature Research Laboratory. In 1929 he went as a biologist on a scientific survey party, sent from England at the request of the New Zealand government, to examine and report on aspects of the export lamb trade. Two years later he became officer in charge of the food preservation and transport section of CSIR at Cannon Hill, Brisbane. The primary objective of the section was to find a viable way to send chilled beef to Britain. In 1938 the section moved to Sydney, where further research into cold storage of diverse foods was carried out. In 1940 the section was raised to the status of a division with Vickery as its chief. In the next few years, owing to demands for supplies from the American forces in the Pacific, the section was expanded.; Vickery became the man in demand as wartime food supply problems intensified, and dehydrated meat for Allied forces became known as ‘Vickery mutton’. Vickery was careful to maintain close relations with the food industry, fostering good practice and innovation. He set up an education committee to implement the the first food technology courses in Australia at Hawkesbury Agricultural College and Sydney Technical College, and encouraged his staff to teach in them. Having travelled widely to observe food research establishments in many countries, Vickery became internationally recognised as one of the fathers of his profession; he was a member of the international committee that initiated the International Union of Food Science and Technology (IUFoST) and an honorary fellow of the UK Institute of Food Science and Technology. The Institute of Food Technologists conferred on him its International Award for 1960 for _‘_outstanding efforts to promote international exchange of ideas in the field of food technology’. By the time he retired in 1967, the division was housed in new laboratories at North Ryde and Cannon Hill. In retirement Vickery returned to the laboratory, publishing original research on cyclopropenoid fatty acids which cause pink/white disorder in eggs. In 1990 he published his comprehensive book _Food Science and Technology in Australia._ Warmly remembered for his integrity, commitment and enlightened administration, he is commemorated in the JR Vickery Address, delivered at the annual convention of the Australian Institute of Food Science and Technology."

Vickery was an important painter in Australia's engagement with the Op Art movement.\\n\\nA student at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, the artist had good success as a portrait artist early in his career. A finalist in the Archibald Prize three times: in 1932 with a portrait of Miss Leila Pirani, and twice in 1933 with his self portrait, and a portrait of Miss Joan Burbury. After a brief stay in London, he moved to the United States of America in the 1930s, where he pursued his arts practice while working in advertising in New York, as an illustrator. From 1943 through to the end of the Second World War, he sketched the portraits of more than 650 patients in military hospitals in the US and the South West Pacific, as part of the USO. Vickery's contribution continued after the end of the war, as Chairman of group counselling for The Society of Illustrators Veterans' Program, supporting upskilling, education, and reengagement.\\n\\nBy the 1950s, Vickery had become friends with Philip Guston and come into contact with other members of the expressionist New York School, including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Yves Kline. Despite his proven capacity as a fine portrait artist, Vickery primarily worked in Op Art, and named the New York School as a significant influence. He exhibited regularly in the US over the course of his career, and three decades after his death, his contribution was recognised at his alma mater: an exhibition of his work was the inaugural show at the Victorian College of the Arts' Founders Gallery in 2013. Vickery's work is represented in the collections of the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia, Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki. The University of Melbourne offers the John Vickery Scholarship for Art students enrolled in Painting or Drawing, based on financial need and academic achievement."

In London from 1933, von Marientreu was introduced into fashionable society by his patron, Mrs Marie Ludlow-Symonds. He was soon in demand as a portrait painter, many of his subjects coming from high-ranking sections of the military and society, including royalty. Between 1935 and 1955, he created portraits of sitters such as King George V; Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother; and Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery. He also exhibited regularly throughout this period, often with large scale genre paintings dealing with subjects such as mythology, war and historical scenes. His obituary in The Times recalled him as ‘a very gentle man, and immaculately turned out, choosing always to paint, no matter what the subject, in one of the same Savile Row tailored suits that he might wear to one of his exhibition openings’."

My writing is nearly all early morning or late at night at home, conceived in the head as I walk. I walk an enormous amount, walk around the suburbs and things like that, and things come in my head when I’m walking, largely because I find it very hard to concentrate unless my body is active. Perhaps this is a result of my obsession with sport, which I regard as a kind of activity in which the dichotomy between soul and body gets relaxed, a kind of activity in which I find release. I find it very hard, indeed I envy painters and sculptors very much because they have a physical activity which corresponds to the production of their art, whereas poets can only sit there and write, and this I find difficult. I get up and pace and dance and walk around and go for long walks, just as a way to release myself.\\n\\nI find my poetry can begin in any one of a host of ways. I suppose much more when I was young it came just from lines in the head, rhythms, almost you might say, melodies. Now it comes in a variety of ways but ideas play a much larger part now. Seldom do I find poems coming immediately out of a direct experience. It takes a prolonged period, for the most part, of contemplation wherein one experience feeds into other experiences, forms of language, metaphors, ideas coming from quite different areas, until the whole conception becomes dense enough to produce a poem. I find if I try and write poems immediately out of some intense emotional experience, it’s odds on they’ll be merely subjective or private or rhetorical. I need to find something that produces enough density to create a poem that works and not just something for the scrapbook.",

In 1963 he was won the Australian Commercial and Industrial Artists' Association's Award of Distinctive Merit, and thirty years later he was inducted into the Illustrators' Hall of Fame. In the 1970s Walters moved away from full time advertising work to concentrate on painting, holding solo shows of landscapes and photorealist nudes. Gradually he developed a specialisation in portraiture, undertaking many commissions. When he won the Archibald Prize in 1979 for a portrait of Phillip Adams - pipping Keith Looby's portrait of Padraic McGuinness - Adams predicted correctly that the 'arties' would be furious because of Walters's background in commercial art. Walters has stated that 'My main objective as a portrait painter is to paint as well as my hero, Velasquez, in my estimation by far the world's greatest portraitist. I feel this is unlikely to be brought to fruition, although sometimes there are instances when I feel I get a little closer.' The National Portrait Gallery acquired his painting of Sir Zelman Cowen PC AK GCMG GCVO QC DCL by gift of Joseph Brown and Marc Besen AO in 2000. In 2006, also by gift from Joseph Brown, the Gallery acquired Walters’s undated portrait of Arthur Boyd."

Over the decade and into the 1980s, her paintings became deliberately childlike in style and autobiographical in content, and frequently incorporated text (and horses). From 1978 to 1984 she was a partner with John Nixon in the exhibition space Art Projects. At the same time, between 1973 and 1989, she taught privately and at various schools and colleges. Between 1973 and 2006 she held about 90 solo exhibitions and was represented in numerous group shows. She won the Portia Geach Award for 1990, and represented Australia at the Venice Biennale in 1993. In 2005 there was a retrospective of her works on fabric at Griffith University, where she has been Adjunct Professor in the Painting Department since 2002. The exhibition Jenny Watson: here, there and everywhere, reflecting her many years’ travel and work overseas, showed at the Ian Potter Museum of Art in early 2012. Watson is represented in the National Gallery of Australia and state and regional galleries."

Largely self-taught, Westwood did not start painting professionally until his mid thirties and held his first exhibition in 1967. Prior to this he had an eclectic career in economics, advertising and the film industry. His decision to pursue an artistic vocation was prompted by a friendship with Jeffrey Smart and Justin O'Brien, with whom he had some lessons. His work was characterised by a dispassionate scrutiny of objects and a mannerly approach in their portrayal. Like fellow painter and friend, Margaret Olley (who sat for him on a number of occasions) he emphasised craft, conscientiousness and respect for tradition in his practice. His portraiture has been described as photorealist. He was the official artist appointed by the Federal Government to the 75th Anniversary of the Gallipoli landings in 1990, travelling with the veterans. The resulting paintings and sketches were exhibited at the Australian War Memorial. Westwood's work is represented in State and University collections throughout Australia and in the National Gallery of Australia, as well as in a number of corporate collections. His portraits of Prime Ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Fraser are currently on loan to the National Portrait Gallery and are on display in Kings Hall."

After studying half-heartedly at art school he travelled to Europe on a scholarship. In London he excited art dealers and fell under the influence of painters such as Francis Bacon. He won the international prize at the second Paris Biennale for Young Artists in 1961, and married his beautiful muse, Wendy Julius, the following year. Through the 1960s he exhibited around the world before returning to live on the Sydney harbourside. He began the 1970s with gentle pictures of birds, moving on to massive portraits of the poets Verlaine and Rimbaud before taking two years to paint the eighteen-panel Alchemy 1972-1973. He then turned to series of paintings of waves, interiors, the harbour, and coastal landscapes. In 1978, his annus mirabilis, he became the first artist to win the Archibald Prize for portraiture, the Wynne Prize for landscape and the Sulman Prize for genre painting all in the same year. He died of an overdose in a motel in Thirroul, New South Wales in the winter of 1992."

I’ve always understood, basically, that I used to be something else, that I’m a continuation of a particular kind of thread of human spirit, that the only thing that I’m involved in is the notion of interpreting time, in a sense that I’m alive. That the spirit will continue and it’ll be the same as what it was, and various painters have given their flash at it and that in a summary is basically what I’m doing. Along with that, is like, the immense sense of the requirement towards survival so one gets more interested in the capacity for power, or in the various ways that can be appropriated. And that art has to follow that, has to employ it, if it’s of any value.\\n\\nThere’s no such a thing as Australian art because there’s probably no such a thing as Australia. There’s a kind of ancient piece of immense and interesting and very strange land, which has had a few people come down on it and in a very surreal way started a kind of sensual civilisation. It’s got to a kind of point where we’re suffering like the rest of the world with a kind of paralysis of confidence.\\n\\nI think that humankind are trying to force and press open a new area of brain think – a capacity to sense, a broader knowing. In order to do that we’re going to have in God’s, or in the puzzle’s term, some sort of a major reckoning up. We’ve got death absolutely in our hands, a complete capacity to bang it out, and we’re trying to force open this newer channel. I see, to a certain degree, that I along with numbers of other individuals, are trying to, you know, cause inside their own pressure, that breaking through, that kind of time. I mean, there’s immense relaxation inside it, but there’s also like the heat towards want, the necessity of the mystery of life, of the system of life, which is always, like, come and go. (Laughs)",

                    "content": "Edward Gough Whitlam AC QC (1916-2014) was prime minister from the end of 1972 to the end of 1975. Born in Melbourne, educated in Canberra and Sydney, he was admitted to the New South Wales Bar after war service. He won the Federal seat of Werriwa in 1952, was deputy leader of the ALP from 1960 to 1967, and was then its leader until the end of 1977, a record term for the party. In 1972 he became the first Labor Prime Minister since 1949. During his term in office he abolished conscription; cut ties with South Africa; negotiated diplomatic relations with China; began inquiries into Aboriginal land rights; abolished fees for tertiary education; established the Schools Commission; introduced welfare payments for single-parent families and homeless people; ended the death penalty for Federal crimes; and reduced the voting age to 18. Whitlam's term came to an abrupt end on 11 November 1975. In the preceding eighteen months the government had been shaken by a series of scandals, resignations, sackings and ministerial reshuffles. In October 1975 the Opposition, led by Malcolm Fraser, used the Liberal majority in the Senate to block the supply of funds essential to the operation of the government. Aiming to force Whitlam to an early election, he justified his action on the grounds that the 'incompetence, the damage, the failures of the worst government in our history cannot be ignored'. Whitlam, in turn, declared that it was unconstitutional for the Senate to attempt to determine who should hold government. The deadlock continued for several weeks, with the government's money fast running out. On 11 November the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, having consulted the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Garfield Barwick, dismissed Gough Whitlam and appointed Malcolm Fraser Caretaker Prime Minister. Whitlam died at the age of 98 on 21 October 2014. Five thousand people, including seven past and present prime ministers, attended Whitlam’s state memorial service, with many more thousands gathering outside the Sydney Town Hall. In his eulogy, Indigenous leader Noel Pearson called Whitlam ‘Australia’s greatest white elder.’"

                    "content": "Fred Williams OBE, painter and etcher, was one of the most important Australian artists of the twentieth century. His unique landscape vision emerged in the late 1950s, after his return from a period of study and work in London. The 1960s saw an increasing minimalism in his paintings, which reached its most extreme point at the end of the decade. In his monumental works of 1969, he attempted to evoke the vast scale of the Australian land through canvases of a single colour dotted with tiny flecks of paint. Although Williams later turned to representation of denser, more colourful terrain, his bare, uncompromising pictures of the 1960s contributed profoundly to subsequent interpretation of the Australian landscape. Williams made a number of portraits of friends and family members, particularly during the 1970s. He completed his first portrait commission, of Sir Louis Matheson, first Vice Chancellor of Monash University, in 1976; portraits of University of Melbourne figures followed. The National Portrait Gallery has his self portrait at the easel, and his portrait of Murray Bail, with whom he served on the Council of the National Gallery of Australia. Subjects of his other masterly portraits include Rudy Komon and John Brack."

I think I know what I’m doing now.\\n\\nI basically start from a situation and the characters in the situation. My plays are plays about character rather than plays about theme. I don’t start off with a thesis and construct a play around that thesis, I start off with characters and try and follow the logical paths that those characters would follow in the play. So, sometimes I start with an outline. _What If You Died Tomorrow?_ started with a fairly close three-page outline. Sometimes, I – as in _The Removalists_ – I start from the situation and see where that situation leads. _The Department_: the very first rough draft started from a listing of the topics on the agenda. The latest play, _A Handful of Friends_, started from an initial scene. So, I haven’t got a clear-cut way of going about it, except that the first draft is invariably the biro-written one, very very rough and I expect it to be. I’d rather be fluent and let it all come out in that first draft and then refine and refine later on.\\n\\nWhen you’re writing from character, some of it’s intuitive. You just feel I know, I know my character well enough now, I know what he’ll do in a situation, I know how he’ll react. You keep referring back to reality to try and get a check on the types of behaviour, you say, ‘Now when I was in that situation, or when Fred was in that situation, what sort of way did they react to this?’, and so you keep referring back, but essentially, once your characters are under way, you just intuitively feel them and what they’ll do.\\n\\nSometimes the structure grows, I suppose the word is ‘organically’.\\n\\nI love watching political processes at work, I really love watching power struggles and the way people use language as an instrument of power, as an instrument to gain power, prestige, status, love, whatever they want out of life. I’m primarily interested in the way people relate to each other and use language to do it.",

One of the first undergraduates to study at the University of Sydney, he developed a particular interest in education and the rights of women - he was responsible for the Married Women's Property Act of 1879, and was Founding Chairman of the university's Women's College. As a young man he worked as a reporter on Henry Parkes's radical liberal newspaper Empire. Windeyer represented West Sydney in the Legislative Assembly intermittently from 1860; in 1876 and 1878-1879 he was attorney general in the Parkes-Robertson coalition. Parkes wrote in Fifty Years in the Making of Australian History (1892) that 'My friend Windeyer was a young man of high spirit, bold and decisive in the common incidents of life, with a strong capacity for public affairs. He would have made as good a soldier as he has made a sound Judge.'"

All that he may hope for is, after years of toil laboriously spent in trying to do his duty, that he may win the confidence of the intelligent thinking portion of the community, those who are interested in maintaining law and order, those who desire to see the rights of property respected, and every citizen protected, as far as the right administration of justice can protect him, in the enjoyment of his personal liberty, in his character and in the exercise of his rights. And when the public has thoroughly come to understand that his only desire is to see the right succeed and the truth established, juries may feel confident that they may safely accept such advice and assistance in their deliberations as it comes within the province of a judge to offer. Of popularity beyond this he can know nothing\\n\\nThe duties he has to discharge are often disagreeable, and sometimes painful. Indeed, one of the drawbacks attending the judicial position was that it very much cut one off from social intercourse with one’s fellow citizens in a small society like this, where everyone was known, and where so many who might be known as acquaintances, were frequently before the Court, as parties to proceedings before it. So, one must be careful to avoid all appearance of evil occasion for scandal.",

While still a student, she won the Le Gay Brereton Prize for Drawing; she has since participated in countless solo and group exhibitions. From 1961 to 1971 she taught at various secondary schools and colleges; from 1972 to 1978 she taught at the West Australian Institute of Technology in Perth; from 1979 to 1985 she taught at Hornsby College of TAFE. Meanwhile, from 1967 she travelled widely through remote areas of Australia and abroad. She won the Wynne Prize in 1971 and the Portia Geach Memorial Awards in both 1983 and 1984. Recipient of a number of smaller prizes, she has been an Archibald finalist seven times, several times with self-portraits, of which she has made many over the course of her career (the ‘horned’ turban is characteristic.) The Art Gallery of New South Wales has four of her works and she is represented in a number of regional galleries. Gavin Fry’s monograph _Margaret Woodward_ was published by the Beagle Press in 2003."

                    "content": "Judith Wright (1915–2000), poet, conservationist and Aboriginal land rights campaigner, was born at Thalgaroch Station, near Armidale, NSW, into a pastoralist family whose origins go back to the first settlement in the Hunter Valley in the 1820s. After studying English at the University of Sydney, she travelled in Europe from 1937 to 1938, before settling in Sydney to write. She wrote 'an occasional modest, thoughtful poem', but when Japan entered the war, she returned to help on the family property, Wollomombi. During this time, she rediscovered her love of the countryside and also had the opportunity to think deeply about her art, leading to the first intensely creative period of her writing. From 1943 to 1947 she worked at the University of Queensland, where she met and married the philosopher and writer J.P. McKinney. Her first major volume of poetry, _The Moving Image_ (1946) was said to have 'brought a sense of excitement and anticipation to the Australian literary world of the time'. It was followed by _Woman to Man_ (1949), which won the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry, _The Gateway_ (1953), _The Two Fires_ (1955), _Birds_ (1961), The _Other Half_ (1966), and _Alive_ (1973), among many others. She also wrote novels, short stories, children's stories and literacy criticism. A conservationist, Wright co-founded the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland and was president from 1964 and 1976. Through the 1960s and early 1970s she was devoted to protecting the Great Barrier Reef from oil drilling and campaigned against land mining on Fraser Island, which she evoked in her poem 'Australia 1970'. She was also an active supporter of Aboriginal land rights. The Canberra suburb 'Wright' is named after her."

                    "content": "William Yang (b. 1943) is a pre-eminent Australian photographer known for an intensely sustained body of work that examines issues of cultural and sexual identity, and which unflinchingly documents the lives of his friends and community and his own lived experience with curiosity, sensitivity and humour. He is known in particular for his documentation of the Sydney LGBTIQ+ community from the 1970s onwards, including the evolution of the Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras, and for photographic series engaging with the impact of HIV/AIDS on his friends and community, his sense of identity as a Chinese-Australian, and his family history and relationships.\\n\\nBorn in Mareeba, near Cairns, Yang grew up in a family who repudiated their Chinese heritage so as to escape the intolerance characteristic of mid-twentieth century Australia. He realised he was Chinese at age six, after being subjected to a bigoted taunt at school. He has recalled becoming aware of what homosexuality meant as a high school student in Cairns, when he came across an article that made him feel as if 'there were only four homosexuals in the world: Oscar Wilde, Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo – and me'. He was given his first camera at seventeen, but became more serious about photography as a student at the University of Queensland, where he studied architecture and began writing and directing plays. In the late 1960s, he moved to Sydney. Having decided to make a living as a photographer, he attended numerous parties and events to take images of celebrities for the social pages of magazines, creating at the same time an unmistakeable and candid record of the city's creative cliques and subcultures. 'The arena suited me; it was more theatrical', Yang wrote in his Sydney Diary 1974–1984. 'Even as a playwright I'd always thought that real life set up better situations than you could ever think of yourself.'\\n\\nBy the mid-1970s his connections to the theatre and the creative arts had resulted in portraits of sitters such as artists Martin Sharp and Brett Whiteley; designers Linda Jackson and Jenny Kee; and theatre director Jim Sharman, whose friends and collaborators Yang also photographed. Two of the very first photographs purchased for the National Portrait Gallery's collection, for example, were Yang's portraits of actor Judy Davis (b. 1959), who in 1981 performed the title role in Sharman's production of _Lulu_ for the Sydney Theatre Company and the State Theatre Company of South Australia, and writer and Nobel laureate Patrick White (1912–1990), whom Yang first photographed in 1977, backstage after a performance of White's play _Big Toys_, directed by Sharman. Yang's first exhibition, _Sydneyphiles_, at the Australian Centre for Photography in 1977, established Yang (then Willy Young) as the preeminent freelance photographer and social documenter of the period. He changed his name from Young to Yang in 1983. He has since exhibited widely in Australia and abroad, also becoming known as a storyteller through his performance works which combine spoken word monologue, memoir and slide projection – such as _Friends of Dorothy_, _Shadows_ and _Blood Links_ – and series of photographs characterised by the use of text in the form of handwritten inscriptions.\\n\\nYang's work has been included in many significant group exhibitions such as _World without end_ (AGNSW, 2000); _Don't leave me this way: art in the age of AIDS_ (NGA, 1994); _Life Lines_ (QAGOMA, 2009); _On the edge: Australian photographers of the 1970s_ (San Diego Museum of Art, 1998); _Sydney Photographed_ (MCA, 1994); and _From Bondi to Uluru_ (Higashikawa Arts Centre, Hokkaido, 1993). A retrospective of his photographs, _Diaries_, was held at the State Library of New South Wales in 1998. In 2001 the National Portrait Gallery mounted the exhibition _William Yang: Australian Chinese_ which then toured widely in Australia. Yang has produced books including _Patrick White: The late years_ (1995), _Sadness_ (1996), _Friends of Dorothy_ (1997) and _China_ (2008). His works are held in major state galleries, the National Gallery of Australia and the National Portrait Gallery, for which Yang created the commissioned work _My Generation_ in 2008. In 2021 Queensland Art Gallery held the major survey exhibition _William Yang: Seeing and Being Seen_, and published a book of the same name."

But after that period, I started to do performance pieces. My photography changed a bit because one of the things that I undertook was to photograph my own family which represented the Chinese in Australia. I claimed my heritage in the 80s because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged.\\n\\nAnd the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields in the place where my uncle had been shot. I somehow knew that this was an important event because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event. And that was a very important moment in my life. I kept doing self-portraits and I’ve done about 40 of them.\\n\\nGradually I evolved to tell my own story and just photograph things about my own life. I’m very happy that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so I feel that I’m living my art as well as my life. And so that’s very satisfying for me.\\n\\nI had to come to terms with being Chinese, being gay and just feeling comfortable as a human being. There are lots of people who aren’t comfortable about that, still. And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. That’s been my philosophy.",

                    "content": "Yunupiŋu (1948–2023), revered senior ceremonial Yolŋu man of the Gumatj clan from North-East Arnhem Land, fought tirelessly for the rights and recognition of Yolŋu and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people alike. Born at Melville Bay near Yirrkala, where he lived for his entire life, he held an unwavering respect for the land, Yolŋu culture and his people. Like his father, Mungurrawuy Yunupiŋu, he was a fierce leader and political trailblazer who played a critical role in the 1963 Yirrkala Bark Petitions. These petitions asserted Yolŋu ownership of land leased by the federal government to mining company Nabalco, and were the first documents articulating First Nations connection to land and Country to be recognised by parliament, paving the way for the 1976 _Aboriginal Land Rights Act_. As long-term chair of the Northern Land Council, the statutory authority appointed to represent traditional landowners and the interests of Aboriginal people, he continued to fight for land rights, particularly in relation to the use of Aboriginal land threatened by government and mining companies. Through his work with the Gumatj Corporation, Yunupiŋu was vocal about the need for action in reducing Indigenous poverty, driven by education, employment and business development. As chair of the Yothu Yindi Foundation, he was instrumental in establishing the Garma Festival, an annual celebration of Yolŋu culture and a forum for political debate. His commitment to the Aboriginal community was recognised in 1985 with an Order of Australia and in 2015 he received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Melbourne for his life’s work for Indigenous rights. Yunupiŋu was an inspirational advocate for political agency and cultural leadership for First Nations people across Australia."
