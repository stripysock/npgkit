Working with photography, video and textile, Atem focuses on migrant narratives and the African diaspora, creating intimate and sometimes fantastical portraits of family, friends and, frequently, herself.\\n\\nAtemâ€™s major new commission _The Last Women_ embodies the artistâ€™s vibrant style of staged studio portraiture. In this monumental self portrait, Atem appears as a recurrent figure, bearing fruit and embracing native flowers, a symbol of her grounding in Australia. She wears a toub featuring a South Sudanese flag, a vintage kimono, Indonesian batik and African wax print, or Ankara. Atem emigrated with her family to NSWâ€™s Central Coast in 1997, and her work often speaks to her sense of belonging and connection to her community in Australia and beyond. Each prop in _The Last Women_ symbolises ancestral stories of migration and the diversity of the diasporic experience.\\n\\nThe explicit staging in Atemâ€™s work honours and builds upon the history of African studio photography, particularly the work of Malick SidibÃ©, Philip Kwame Apagya and Seydou KeÃ¯ita. Like them, Atem uses portraiture as a way to assert her relationship to culture and identity. Simultaneously controlling the lens and contained within it, Atem confidently meets our gaze. Hers is a performance that is deeply personal yet expands into shared histories and collective narratives, like the cosmos that unfolds behind the artist, binding her different personas together.",

                "transcript": "Yeah, I think I've got a really strong interest in, I suppose, non-Western ways of keeping history and recording history because that's what I've grown up with. So as a South Sudanese person, a Dinka person, we have a tradition of writing songs to tell stories. And beyond that, also a lot of our names are sort of ways to record history as well. My name Atong means like war, or it references war, because I was born during a time of war. And other people's names reference whatever kind of period that they were born in. So, there's this interesting thing where for me, culturally, history has always been embodied and has always been a participatory thing rather than, I don't know, something that happens after the fact. It's not about, say, if you get to write it, you get to sort of change it or whatever. It's more along the lines of just by existing, by having a name, by participating in a family, you are part of history, and your participation in that history will always be recorded.\\n\\nSo my interest is, like you know, how do I continue that history through my own photographic practice and arts practice. There's sort of for me an interest in figuring out how to combine the visual language of photography with the oral language of record-keeping in a Dinka tradition.\\n\\nI think for me as someone who uses primarily digital photography, it can often feel like the photographic object is separate to the practice of making photographic works because they can just sort of exist in the digital realm. But there is also for me such an importance to the printed photograph and that as a sculpture in its own right.\\n\\nI'm trying to think of ways to engage with that object outside of printing, framing, hanging. Because my relationship to photography or my relationship to photos, I should say, is photo albums. These objects that require participation and these objects that kind of have an emotional weight as well as a physical weight. And, you know, are designed to sort of exist as objects, and I find that really important and fascinating.",

In the early 1950s he became a company director with BHP, a position he held for thirty-two years. For fifteen years during this period he was also Chairman of Rheem Australia and Koitaki Ltd. His interest in the visual arts led him to accept the position of inaugural Chairman of the Board of the Australian National Gallery from 1982 to 1986. At the end of this period he established The Gordon Darling Australian Print Fund, which has acquired more than 6000 prints for the national collection to date. In 1991 he established the Gordon Darling Foundation, which provides funding and staff development opportunities for public art institutions Australia-wide. That year, too, he and his wife, Marilyn, initiated and facilitated the touring exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery. The interest generated by the exhibition led to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery. Amongst the very earliest acquisitions of the Gallery were gifts from Darling, who accepted the inaugural Board's invitation to become the Founding Patron of the Gallery in mid-1998. Since then he has enabled the acquisition of many key works for the Collection, and his support carried the Gallery to the opening of its new, dedicated home in December 2008. \\n\\nJiawei Shen (b. 1948) who painted the portrait of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark for the National Portrait Gallery in 2005, often places his sitters within evocative dreamlike or remembered settings. The backdrop of his portrait of Darling suggests the competition-winning design for the dedicated National Portrait Gallery â€“ the project the Founding Patron long envisaged and urged. Set apart from the rest of the Collection in the Gordon Darling Hall, and seeming to capture some of the natural light of the space, his portrait hangs adjacent to the boards listing the many donors and benefactors to the institution.",

So I sat in the chair and crossed my legs, and when he came back he siad â€œhold that, Iâ€™ll paint you like thatâ€. He was always someone who you felt you were never at a distance from. Iâ€™ve always loved the painting because itâ€™s got that personal feel about it.

During the First World War, Kingsford Smith served in the Australian Imperial Force, the Australian Flying Corps and the Royal Flying Corps, and was awarded the Military Cross for bravery. Ulm, who at 16 had been among the first troops to land at Gallipoli, and later served on the Western Front, had returned to Sydney with a vision of establishing a commercial airline. He became Kingsford Smithâ€™s business partner in 1927, and they founded the short-lived Australian National Airways in 1930. In 1934, Ulm went down in the sea between California and Hawaii; his body was never found. Kingsford Smith, too, disappeared, probably near the coast of Myanmar, on an attempt at the Britainâ€“Australia record.",

                "transcript": "The double portrait of Captain Charles Kingsford Smith and Captain Charles Ulm was painted by William Dargie in 1961 and measures 133.5 cm high by 108.8 cm wide.\\n\\nThe pair are presented against a brilliant blue sky with patches of white wispy cloud. Broad brushstrokes of light blue and pink give way to a greener bluish tint in the lower section of the background. The clouds descend into pale grey as the landscape blurs into the distance.\\n\\nBathed in sunlight, the men stand close together and are cropped at the hip. Captain Charles Ulm on our left, faces forward, half his body obscured by Sir Charles Kingsford Smith who stands in front, his body turned toward Ulm, side on.\\n\\nUlmâ€™s direct gaze is forward to us. He has wavy brown hair cut shorter around his prominent ears and a warm rosy tanned complexion. The light from his right creates shadows on the left side of his clear broad forehead and delineates his straight nose, plump cheeks and double chin. His arched dark eyebrows, narrowed laughing eyes and parted lips open his cheery face into a wide smile. \\n\\nUlm wears a beige and green scarf wrapped around his neck and tucked into his aviator jump suit, unzipped to form a V. The one-piece suit is uniformly steely blue grey, a large pocket with a silver button and open upper flap is visible on his right chest. The baggy suit puckers at his waist and upper arm, which is bent at the elbow, and allows his right hand to rest on his hip. Cropped at the bottom edge of the painting, a brown strap is visible looped around the top of his index finger. Although Ulm's left arm is unseen, wrapped behind the figure of Kingsford Smith, the fingers and the thumb of that hand rest on Kingsford Smith's left shoulder.\\n\\nSir Charles Kingsford Smith looks out to the right of the portrait with a similarly tanned complexion to Ulm. His brown leather aviator helmet sits tight on his skull over his ears and clips together under his chin. His round glass goggles are raised above his eyes and held tight against his forehead. With his long oval face in three-quarter profile, a shadow plays on the left side of his face, accentuating his straight eyebrows, drooped eyelids and blue eyes. He has pronounced cheek bones and a long slightly hooked nose. He too is smiling with closed lips, with a slight curved crease around both corners of his mouth. Kingsford Smith wears a chocolate brown leather flying jacket, one side flaps open across his chest and is lined in a beige green sheepskin. At his waist his hands clasp a long slim white folded paper.",

Campbell felt there was a link between the themes and style of his own work (which has explored cars, rock music, surfing and life in the suburbs) and those of Kellyâ€™s. A singer, songwriter and producer, Kellyâ€™s songs refer to specific Australian places and people, and he sings with a marked Australian accent. Kellyâ€™s band went through a number of name changes, ultimately settling on Paul Kelly and The Messengers. Their major break came in 1986, when their double album _Gossip_ was one of the biggest Australian records of the year. The band made _Under the Sun_ (1987) before touring the USA. They disbanded in 1991, and Kelly branched into producing and acting as well as writing and performing. Though he has written most of his long and poetic song list alone, he has also collaborated brilliantly, particularly with First Nations performers including Archie Roach, Yothu Yindi and Kev Carmody, with whom he co-wrote the protest song â€˜From Little Things, Big Things Growâ€™. Of this portrait, Campbell says that the â€˜stripped back to essenceâ€™ quality reflects Kellyâ€™s spare and frank approach to music.",

For 15 months he painted and partied in a cold, grimy Paris studio, gaining some critical success while depending on the Lamberts for an occasional hot meal. In 1902 four of his paintings were chosen for exhibition at the New Salon, Paris; this extraordinary achievement earned him the patronage of Dame Nellie Melba, a relative of his friend, artist Ambrose Patterson (1877â€“1967). Ramsay painted several portraits of Patterson, whose studio was in the same apartment block in Montparnasse. Here Patterson is captured in profile, with his left arm extended in a strong horizontal line that drops elegantly at the wrist over the back of a leather armchair. The portrait, gifted to Patterson in friendship, was damaged while stored in Belgium and subsequently cut down leaving only the top half of the figure. When Ramsay fell ill with tuberculosis, Melba funded his return to Victoria. He worked hard, amassing works for a solo exhibition (held at Melbaâ€™s rented home in Toorak) before dying at the age of 28.",

Namatjira was born at Ntaria/Hermannsburg near Mparntwe/Alice Springs. His distinctive style, though often reductively perceived as consistent with a traditional Western landscape aesthetic, was rooted in deep ancestral connection and knowledge of the Lands spanning his fatherâ€™s Country around the MacDonnell Ranges and his motherâ€™s Country in the region of Palm Valley in Central Australia. Exhibiting from 1938 to great acclaim and working prolifically, demand for his paintings increased during the 1940s. Though Namatjira was well known by the 1950s, his life and career were impacted by widespread prejudice and inequality, and an Australian constitution that did not recognise First Nations people. It is a stark fact that Namatjira was the first Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person to receive citizenship in 1957. Even so, restrictions on his family and his community remained engrained and complex, ultimately leading to his death in 1959. Another portrait of Namatjira painted by Dargie won the Archibald Prize in 1956 â€“ the first time the winning work featured a First Nations subject.",

His figure takes up most of the composition against a distant desert background. \\n\\nThe bright blue desert sky fills the top two thirds of the background around and above Namatjira. In lively and breezy, mostly vertical, strokes, the painted sky starts in bold cerulean at the top of the painting and fades to sapphire and powder blue where it meets the distant purple mountains. Some horizontal paint strokes hint at faint clouds.\\n\\nLand occupies the lower third of the background. In the far distance a blurred mountain range of purples and dark blue runs along the horizon. The flat dirt is rendered in pale peachy oranges. Small blue green dashes and dots of paint suggest sparse and distant vegetation.\\n\\nNamatjira's seated figure, cropped at the shins, fills the foreground. His head is positioned in profile facing the left. His skin is warm shades of dark brown and umber. He has short black hair, thick and wavy, flecked with grey, which neatly follows the shape of his large ear. His forehead angles diagonally toward his prominent brow, creased gently with wrinkles. He has a bushy raised eyebrow, and deeply set brown eye gazing into the distance. His nose is straight and upturned, his mouth slightly open. He has strong cheekbones leading to plump jowls and a thick neck, around which sits a thin red bandana tucked into his white button-up shirt.\\n\\nNamatjira's body is turned slightly towards the left, following his gaze. His left arm is bent at the elbow, the forearm leaning casually on his left thigh, his hand and fingers gently hanging down. Between this hand and his raised right hand, he gently holds a sketch of a landscape, resting on his lap, and angled away from his body. The paper faces towards us directly, showing a watery sketch of a landscape scene. A large tree on the right with grey green foliage, bright blue mountains in the background and pale peachy orange dirt in the foreground. \\n\\nNamatjira has dark taupe pants, his knees are parted, and he sits on a low reddish-brown rock.",

Rehfisch studied at Julian Ashtonâ€™s art school in Sydney but left at the age of 19 to marry. After her daughter started school, Rehfisch returned to painting, training at Antonio Dattilo-Rubboâ€™s atelier, where she met Duncan. She held her first show at the Blaxland Gallery in 1929 and began exhibiting with the Society of Artists in 1931. By this time, she and her husband had separated. Heading to London in 1933, she studied at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art. In 1938, Rehfisch returned to Sydney, where she and Duncan married in 1942. The couple were active in Sydneyâ€™s contemporary art community and exhibited their work together at Sydneyâ€™s Macquarie Galleries. In 1947 they moved to Berrima, painting the landscapes around Goulburn and the Southern Highlands before returning to Sydney in 1951 where Duncan became director of the influential David Jones Art Gallery.",

It becomes something thatâ€™s a passing thing that people are not quite aware of themselves.\\n\\nIâ€™ve always been interested in the elemental in art and in Australia with the background of Aboriginals. We find that many artists have expressed themselves in various ways on what should be the expression of the Australian beginnings, which is the Aboriginals. But I search for the elemental thing, the depths of their past, the feeling of them living in this country and so forth. But further than that, I do find in the Australian bush there is the spirit of the elemental. One can feel it. Youâ€™re aware of it when you go silently into it.\\n\\nWhen I am approaching painting of a landscape, I firstly am aware of my subject. I want to know more of it. I walk into it. I must walk around and round all those trees and into the distance and the space that fills them, to listen, to find that feeling thatâ€™s vibrating, so as I can set it down in the spirit of that thing which I think is the essence that I should express.",

From 1951 to 1966 he was dean of the law faculty at the University of Melbourne, and in 1970 he became Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland. Seven years later, at the invitation of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, he succeeded Sir John Kerr as Governor-General; during his five-year term he did much to restore the status of the vice-regal post. Returning to Oxford University in the 1980s, he became Provost of Oriel College and later Pro-Vice Chancellor. He published widely on aspects of law but also attempted to enhance public comprehension of constitutional issues, particularly advocating for Australia to become a republic. Cowenâ€™s autobiography, _A Public Life_, was published in 2006.",

Marshall contracted poliomyelitis at age six, and the vicissitudes and triumphs of his childhood are detailed in his best-selling autobiographical work, _I Can Jump Puddles_ (1955). The book has sold more than eight million copies and has been translated into 30 languages. Marshall wrote with great dedication from the early 1920s and in 1933 won the first of his three Australian Literary Society Short Story Awards. He wrote for _Workerâ€™s Voice_, the _Communist Review_ and the _Left Review_, _Smithâ€™s Weekly_, the _Bulletin_, _ABC Weekly_, _Bohemia_ and _Meanjin_. _These Are My People_, stories he collected while travelling with his wife Olive in a horse-drawn caravan through Victoria, was published in 1944. Late in life he worked on projects highlighting various challenges confronting people living with disability.",

When I won a competition, I imagined I must be good, and yet I couldnâ€™t get them published. So I had to keep on and I remember one of the stories that I won a prize with was called _A Little Son_ and it was a story of my mother away outback and it described the birth of one of my sisters. And she told me the story and it won the Australian Literature Societyâ€™s short story competition for one year and I had to read it out aloud. And I brought my mother in to listen to it; she was a very wonderful person. And there Iâ€™m describing how she had knotted towels at the head of her bed and while she was lying on this bed, away outback, with a blowing dust and the hessian above her head, and where father sometimes used to pierce it with a knife and catch the dust in a bucket; sheâ€™s lying there and she said â€˜All that I could rememberâ€™, she told me, very vividly, â€˜was the smell of the Myall wood stockwhip handle that was hanging at the end of the bedâ€™.\\n\\nSo I wrote that story and I liked it, but people seemed rather shocked at it at the time, to motherâ€™s astonishment. And I remember some woman coming up to her there and saying â€˜Your son must be marriedâ€™, and she said â€˜No, heâ€™s not, heâ€™s telling about meâ€™.\\n\\nWhen I began working in the city, that was the sad time of my life. See I think that when youâ€™re crippled, childhood is fairly happy. It is not the affliction that makes life hard but the attitude of people towards it, and this manifests itself very strongly in your teens. That is the time when you want to grab a girl. And Iâ€™ve described this period, although not very well Iâ€™m afraid, in In _Mine Own Heart_.\\n\\nWhat I wanted to do was to describe how I broke through this feeling of restriction, of sadness, and I succeeded in doing it but I havenâ€™t quite succeeded in doing it as I wanted to do in my books. I have one more to write at the time of speaking and that will describe that period of my life when I moved round with artists and writers and when I became much more confident in myself.",

Her circle of friends and colleagues included Jeffrey Smart, Russell Drysdale and William Dobell, whose portrait of Olley was awarded the 1948 Archibald Prize. Her first solo exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries in Sydney the same year was a sell-out, and from that beginning, she held at least one solo exhibition annually. Her legacy is not only as a painter but as an arts patron and benefactor: since its foundation in 1990, the Margaret Olley Art Trust has donated many Australian and international artworks to public collections nationwide. Tweed River Art Gallery is home to the Margaret Olley Art Centre, which includes a reproduction of Olleyâ€™s studio and living space.\\n\\nThough considered primarily a painter of interiors and still life, Olley was involved in portraiture consistently throughout her career, and her self portraits are a wonderful synthesis of both aspects of her practice. Employing the mirror motif, this self portrait is simultaneously evocative of both her inner life and the vivid, external world of her home and studio â€“ bursting with flowers, fruit, artworks and artefacts â€“ in which she found endless inspiration.",

This I donâ€™t arrange and then paint it immediately; I always have a very definite idea what I want to do. Sometimes it doesnâ€™t come off immediately, sometimes it does, and this is a very satisfying thing. Other times I paint say for a whole day, and then leave it for several weeks; it might go on for months or even six weeks, taking out something, repainting again.\\n\\nI very rarely make a detailed sketch of what I intend to do. I might make little thumbnail notes but never very detailed, because I feel you kill the painting you want to do.\\n\\nPainting to me is like drawing; you draw with your brush or your palette knife, so whether one is using a paintbrush or watercolour or a pen, itâ€™s all creative, and I never mind which medium Iâ€™m using.\\n\\nThe paintings I do are naturally things I â€“ Iâ€™m inspired whether itâ€™s the colour, the shape; it might be the colour of the skin of a native woman, it doesnâ€™t matter.\\n\\nI can hear myself saying things that are so trite, and theyâ€™re not really how I want to say them. This is a dreadful thing for a painter. We say it in paint, otherwise weâ€™d be a writer or perhaps a musician, who knows?",

His first novel _Homesickness_ (1980) won the National Book Council Award and shared the Age Book of the Year Award; _Holdenâ€™s Performance_ (1987) won the 1988 Victorian Premierâ€™s Award for fiction. His critically acclaimed 1998 novel _Eucalyptus_, which won the Miles Franklin Award, Australiaâ€™s most prestigious literary prize, has been voted one of the top 20 must-read Australian novels.

Chomley was founder of the Victorian Arts and Crafts Society, where she met Teague, and secretary of the committee who organised the _First Australian Exhibition of Womenâ€™s Work_ in Melbourne in 1907, now considered a landmark event in the history of womenâ€™s art in Australia. After travelling to England in June 1914, Chomley was prevented from returning home by the outbreak of the First World War. She threw herself into work: teaching English to refugees and volunteering at the Robert Lindsay Memorial Hospital for Officers. In 1916 she joined the Australian Red Cross, coordinating a team of volunteers to distribute thousands of parcels to Australian prisoners of war, who described her as the â€˜divine angel of mercyâ€™. Remaining in London after the armistice, Chomley worked with organisations investigating working conditions and opportunities for British immigrant women in Australia. She returned permanently to Melbourne in 1934, resuming her work with the Victoria League for Commonwealth Friendship and the Arts and Crafts Society.",

The 1960s saw an increasing minimalism in his paintings, which reached its most extreme point at the end of the decade. His monumental works of 1969 sought to evoke the scale of the Australian landscape through canvases of a single colour dotted with tiny flecks of paint. The bare, uncompromising pictures contributed profoundly to subsequent Australian interpretations of place.\\n\\nThis painting, one of the very first acquisitions of the National Portrait Gallery, was the last and most considered of his few self portraits. The work of painting is emphasised; this is no tousle-haired, tortured genius but a serious artist going about his business. The treatment of the jacket is reminiscent of that of rocks and trees in his landscapes of the same period and the work is characteristically enlivened with touches of vibrant colour on cheekbones and ears.",

At 16 she enrolled at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, and she later studied with her uncle, the distinguished portraitist Robert Dowling. In 1891 she was described as â€˜a young artist, who by her clever and conscientious work, has placed herself among the best Australian portrait paintersâ€™. In Europe from 1893, she studied at the AcadÃ©mie Julian in Paris and exhibited at the Salon, and at the Royal Academy and the Royal Institute of Oil Painters in London. After returning to Australia in 1904 she settled in Perth and established a studio in the building that housed the offices of the newspaper, the _West Australian_. Consequently, she came to the attention of Sir John Winthrop Hackett â€“ the newspaperâ€™s owner â€“ who commissioned Fuller to paint at least two portraits of his wife Deborah Vernon Hackett (1887â€“1965). Later the Lady Mayoress of Adelaide, a mining company director and a charity fundraiser, Deborah was 18 when she married Hackett in August 1905. The tea gown in this portrait of her by Fuller matches descriptions of the one Lady Hackett changed into before setting off on her honeymoon.",

It breaks much new ground. It treats practically with problems with which the Australian mother of a family and the Australian housekeeper are confronted day by day, year in and year out. No effort has been spared to make the work the most generally useful publication on the subject of domestic economy which has emanated from the Australian press.\\n\\nThe series of articles which it contains embraces such various subjects as: _Foods; their Functions and Values, The Australian Baby, The Kindergarten, What Young People Should Know, General Hygiene, Home Nursing, Hints upon Personal Appearance, The Home Garden, Poultry Keeping, Domestic Animals and The Typhoid or House Fly_ and _Insect Pests_.\\n\\nEach of these articles has been written by an expert, who speaks with authority upon the subject treated of. The recipes, some 3,500 in number and dealing with every branch of the culinary art and every department of household management have not been collected or collated haphazard [sic] but carefully selected by competent advisers, the great majority being actually contributed and vouched for by the correspondents, whose reliability and knowledge every reasonable care has been taken to ascertain and determine.\\n\\nSince the entire net proceeds of _The Australian Household Guide_ are to be devoted to charities it is hoped that its reception in Australian homes and its appreciation by Australian mothers will warrant the early publication of a second edition.",

                "transcript": "This portrait of Deborah Vernon Hackett was made around 1908 by Florence Ada Fuller. It is painted with oil on canvas and measures 82 centimetres tall by 64 centimetres wide. The ornate gold frame is 13 centimetres wide. At the lower edge in the centre of the frame in black handwritten print is the inscription Mrs J.W. Hackett aet. 16. and beneath this F.A. Fuller.\\n\\nThe young woman is painted realistically with light brushstrokes and soft edges. She is positioned centrally, taking up the bottom two thirds of the canvas in front of a plain dark background. Deborah looks directly towards us. She is visible to her thigh which is seated in a cane chair. \\n\\nThe background is dark olive green. Vertical lines near the top of the painting suggest the folds of a curtain. This graduates to deep shadows that are almost black on the lower left.\\n\\nDeborah wears a large black hat with a low flat crown. A few dashes of paint indicate a bow of gauzy ribbon peeping above the wide brim that sweeps upwards on either side of her head. Her medium-brown hair is drawn off her forehead and curves up and out, giving volume and framing her face. The rest of the hair hangs loose behind her, with a small section falling in gentle waves over her left shoulder. \\n\\nLight touches Deborahâ€™s face from the right of the painting, leaving the left side in partial shadow. Her oval face has a smooth fair complexion and cheeks tinged with delicate pink. Her brown eyebrows are fine and straight. Deborahâ€™s sea-blue eyes look directly at us, their outer edges follow a slightly downwards lilt. Her nose is straight, leading to small shapely lips. The corners of her mouth are slightly upturned, the rose-pink lips are closed. Deborah has a faint groove just beneath her lower lip and a little round chin.\\n\\nA band of cream open lacework encircles Deborahâ€™s neck and extends over her chest. It is secured beneath her chin with a slender gold pin. A long strand of pale pink irregularly shaped stones also hangs about her neck. Her dress is light blue-green, and the fabric looks almost sheer, with a subtle silk-like sheen. Cream-coloured lace runs horizontally across the upper bodice, further ornamented in the middle of her chest by an oblong-shaped reddish gold pin. The sleeves are embellished with lace above the elbows and on the lower edges of the cuffs.\\n\\nThe cuffs of her wide sleeves hang elegantly from her wrists, creating strong almost-vertical lines in parallel with the arm of the straw-coloured cane chair. Deborahâ€™s left hand, displaying the glint of a gold band on her ring finger, is lightly placed over her right on the top of the chairâ€™s arm. Beneath her hands the rounded scroll-shaped edge of the chair is emphasized by its plaited edge.\\n\\nThe back of the cane chair curves down from the arm around her body following the sloping line of Deborahâ€™s left hip at the lower right of the painting. On the bottom left the artistâ€™s signature F. A. Fuller can be seen faintly in brownish pink over the dark background.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucinda Shawcross and voiced by Amy Middleby**",

Her studies at the Academy of Art in Prague ended when war broke out in 1939; she later resumed her studies in Budapest before adopting false papers and â€˜going undergroundâ€™ to escape the persecution of Jewish people. When Cassab began painting again, in 1945, she wrote that sheâ€™d â€˜never let this happen again, this parting from paint and brushâ€™. Soon after arriving in Sydney in 1951 with her husband and two sons, she began securing portrait commissions, and in 1955 her portrait of model Judy Barraclough won the _Australian Womenâ€™s Weekly_ Portrait Prize. The win helped establish Cassabâ€™s reputation for portraits that were distinctly modern yet sufficiently traditional, leading to further portraits of sitters from the fashion world â€“ including June Dally-Watkins OAM (1927â€“2020). Dally-Watkins rose to prominence in the late 1940s with her modelling work for David Jones and magazines including the _Womenâ€™s Weekly_. In 1950 she founded the June Dally-Watkins School for deportment and etiquette, and in 1951 established Australiaâ€™s first modelling agency.",

Shen commenced work on the portrait in Sydney in February 2005, when the Princess made her first royal tour of her homeland. Given the limited time available for the sitting, the artist took many photographs and made several studies and sketches, which were acquired along with the finished painting.\\n\\nBorn Mary Donaldson in Hobart, she gained a degree in commerce and law from the University of Tasmania in 1994. Completing further qualifications in advertising, she worked as an account manager in Melbourne, Edinburgh and Sydney. She met the then Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, like her, an adroit sportsperson, when he visited Sydney for the 2000 Olympic Games. Moving to Denmark in 2002, she studied Danish history and language before her marriage to Frederik in Copenhagen Cathedral on 14 May 2004.",

In 1935 Drysdale married Elizabeth â€˜Bonâ€™ Stephens and two years later, Purves Smith left for Europe, followed in 1938 by Maisie and her mother. This portrait of Maisie by her husband-to-be is thought to have been painted while they were both in London, before he joined the British Army in 1940. The restricted colour palette and energetically painted blue background focuses our attention on Maisieâ€™s striking profile, framed by her fur collar.\\n\\nAfter Maisie returned to Australia, Purves Smith cabled his proposal to her but they were separated for the duration of the war. They married in 1946 in Melbourne, with Drysdale as best man; however, Purves Smith died following surgery to relieve symptoms of tuberculosis in 1949. Maisie completed library studies and became a librarian at the City of Coburg Library and later, the Camberwell City Library. She also served on the Editorial Committee of the Childrenâ€™s Book Council of Victoria. In 1963, Bon Drysdale died, and seven months later Maisie married Russell Drysdale.

Between 1990 and 1996 she completed _The Goddess Series_, portraits of Australian women as mythological/archetypal figures, referring to them as â€˜a testimony to the goodness and healing powers of womenâ€™. Her sitters included actor Ruth Cracknell AM (1925â€“2002), who considered this painting to be her definitive portrait. Cracknell became a household name through her character Maggie Beare in the ABC comedy _Mother and Son_, which ran from 1985 to 1994. Over five decades she appeared in many theatre, television, radio and film productions, including _A Cup of Tea, a Bex and a Good Lie Down_ at the Phillip Street Theatre and a memorable performance as Lady Bracknell in _The Importance of Being Earnest_ for the Melbourne and Sydney theatre companies. After writing her autobiography _A Biased Memoir_ (1997), she published an account of her experience of grief following the death of her husband of 41 years, Eric Phillips, _Journey from Venice_ (2000). In 2001 she received the Gold Logie Hall of Fame Award and a lifetime achievement award at the Helpmann Awards. Cracknell was also an influential spokesperson for older Australian women and an advocate for First Nations rights.",

Painted in one sitting in Drendelâ€™s Melbourne studio, he stood just a metre or so away from Orr as he captured the bristling texture of her auburn hair and deeply etched features, working quickly and confidently in deftly applied oil paint. \\n\\nOrr is a contemporary artist whose performance-based works and installations interrogate social and political issues, environmental concerns, gender and the relationship between identity and place. Trained as an art teacher, she began exhibiting at the Ewing and George Paton Gallery at Melbourne University in the late 1970s.

Subsequent works include _Three Dog Night_ (2003), which won the Christina Stead Award; and _Everything I Knew_ (2008), which was shortlisted for the Prime Ministerâ€™s Literature Award.

Having studied painting and sculpture, he exhibited his works in the 1960s, however he is best known as a gallerist who fostered the careers of emerging Australian artists and facilitated appreciation of the work of their historical antecedents. Having established the Joseph Brown Gallery in Collins Street, Melbourne, in 1967, he built up one of the finest private art collections in Australia, and made such substantial contributions to Australian art history that he was awarded three honorary doctorates. His gift of more than 150 works to the National Gallery of Victoria in 2004 is one of the most generous donations of artworks to a public collection in Australia. Brown purchased _Two Typists_ for his own private collection (the red dot in McKennaâ€™s work capturing this moment) and it was later among the artworks he donated to the NGV.",

As his widow Helen Brack explained: â€˜In Johnâ€™s view, mere likenesses were not portraits; a portrait was about identity, the disposition â€“ not the persona â€“ and the whole picture was the portrait, the configuration in the rectangle and use of picture space.â€™ She said of this painting: â€˜here is an essay about a businessman, and John makes no concessions.â€™ Perpetuated by the Purvesâ€™ son Stuart, Australian Galleries is still in operation and is Australiaâ€™s longest-surviving commercial art business.",

She met architect and designer Alex Jelinek (1925â€“2007) in 1954 and they fell into an intense and rewarding relationship that lasted until Bryansâ€™ passing in 2000. Jelinek graduated from the technical building school of Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ©, near Prague, during the Second World War. In 1946 he became attached to the architectural school of the Prague Academy of Fine Arts, but fled communist Czechoslovakia to live as a displaced person in West Germany. In 1950 he emigrated to Australia on a labour contract, laying track and then working on the Eucumbene Dam site before meeting Bryans. Jelinek drew brilliant designs for far more structures than were ever realised. For Bryansâ€™ second cousin, Canberra academic Bruce Benjamin, he carried out the spiral â€˜Round Houseâ€™ in Gawler Crescent, Deakin, which was named Australian House of the Year in 1957 and is now heritage-listed. This uncompromisingly minimal portrait held pride of place for decades in the coupleâ€™s homes in East Melbourne, Richmond and Kew.",

Alex Jelinek is shown engrossed in his work, wearing his trademark thick, dark framed glasses (that he designed himself). Jelinek and the whole canvas, are enveloped in a rich mustard-yellow. \\n\\nHe sits at an angle, left shoulder turned to us. Although Jelinek has been painted centrally in the large work, he is an outline, rising out of the yellow from a collection of carefully chosen brushstrokes and smudges in dark brown, dark-red and a small amount of white. \\n\\nJelinekâ€™s thick, side-parted, dark-brown hair accentuates his high forehead, his medium â€“ length hair is tousled at the crown and cropped to reveal the shell of his left ear, though there is no anatomical detail within it. Jelinekâ€™s glasses rest on the bridge of his nose, his eyes are downcast towards his work. His eyebrows are thick and straight beneath the frames of his glasses. \\n\\nHe has a sharp, unremarkable nose and a robust, brown moustache. Beneath his moustache smudges of red. A shadow rests under the clean line of his jaw. His head is dipped towards the focus of his gaze. \\n\\nGrey brushstrokes fill in the breadth of his left shoulder. Jelinekâ€™s shirt collar is an assured, mountainous squiggle. At his nape, below his neatly rendered chin, a dark brown, shallow â€œvâ€ marks Jelinekâ€™s open-necked shirt. A brown line descends down his chest surrounded by smudged white in place of a seam with buttons, and tapers off abruptly. A few vertical dark brown, wavy lines and a confident horizontal line illustrate a tucked in, loose-fitting shirt at his waist. \\n\\nJelinek is slim with a youthful build. Dark, confident brushstrokes form a dark hip in high waisted trousers. A fading horizontal line at his waist disappears into the pervasive mustard- yellow, A wonky rectangle of rolled up, rumpled shirtsleeve and light lines indicate his bent elbow and forearm.\\n\\nJelinekâ€™s design bench onto which he is ardently focused is a greenish grey line that starts on the left halfway down the portrait, cutting through the yellow-gold and descending on an angle towards the bottom right, where it veers back in a long, gentle, freehand arch, before stopping abruptly in the middle at the bottom of the work.\\n\\nThe artist Lina Bryans has signed her name in the lower right corner as just â€˜Linaâ€™ in large, light cursive letters.",

It has been suggested that it was perhaps exchanged for this portrait of Gazzard that Cassab painted in the same year. Gazzard trained at the East Sydney Technical College and London Central School for Arts and Craft before setting up a studio in Sydney in 1960. In 1973, with fibre artist Mona Hessing, Gazzard was one of the first craftspeople invited to exhibit at the National Gallery of Victoria. The resulting exhibition, _Clay + Fibre_, generated much discussion about whether craft was art and accelerated the visibility of women artists. Instrumental in craft being taken seriously in Australia, Gazzard helped to set up the Crafts Council of Australia, chaired the Crafts Board of the Australia Council and was President of the World Crafts Council. Through the 1970s and 1980s she exhibited large abstract works in a number of important group shows and solo exhibitions, and was commissioned to create the bronze sculpture _Mingarri: The Little Olgas_ (1988), which stands in the central Executive Courtyard of Parliament House.",

                "transcript": "I think the thing that really concerns me is form. Sometimes Iâ€™m asked where I get my ideas from and itâ€™s hard to say, sometimes it might be sitting in a movie, just a certain shape flicks across the screen and I think â€˜Thatâ€™s just what Iâ€™m looking forâ€™, or on a beach a piece of driftwood, or in the park a squashed fig. Anything can supply it when youâ€™re looking, when youâ€™re feeling the need for a new idea.\\n\\nIâ€™d say that the curve is the thing that interests me, seldom the straight line in an object. Iâ€™m very sensitive to curves, a wrong curve can ruin it from the first half-inch. If I know itâ€™s somehow not going to be right, I just break it up. I break up a lot of things; in fact in my studio at the moment I can see six or eight things that I will no doubt smash up. Perhaps itâ€™s the scale thatâ€™s important in what I do. I keep being dissatisfied with small things, though they can be fun to do at times. I want to do bigger, more massive objects.\\n\\nI never feel so happy as when Iâ€™m quietly working alone. And I have everything here to make my work, the kiln, all. An artist has to be very close to his work. I know when Iâ€™ve been looking in museums, Iâ€™ve often felt that Iâ€™ve known the person whoâ€™s made that object. Perhaps this doing of oneâ€™s own work, oneâ€™s own thing, perhaps this is the link between civilisations. Other civilisations have tried to leave us what they knew. Perhaps this is what itâ€™s about.",

This portrait of operatic soprano Florence Austral (1892â€“1968) was likely painted when the diva toured Australia in 1930. Barronâ€™s portrait presents a clear statement about Australâ€™s success, portraying her as a confident woman in a theatrical pose. \\n\\nBorn Florence Wilson, she studied at the Conservatorium of Music and the University of Melbourne. On arriving in London, she, like her compatriot Nellie Melba, adopted a name honouring her homeland and as â€˜Florence Australâ€™ debuted in the role of BrÃ¼nnhilde in Wagnerâ€™s _Die WalkÃ¼re_ at Covent Garden in 1922. During the 1920s and 1930s she toured North America and Australia and made the first of many recordings. The quality and power of her voice lent itself to the Wagnerian roles that secured her reputation, but she also performed in operas by Verdi, Mozart and Puccini. By the end of the 1930s, Austral was increasingly afflicted with multiple sclerosis. With her husband, flautist John Amadio, she returned to Australia after the war and took up a teaching position at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music in Newcastle.",

He worked as a jackeroo on his great-uncleâ€™s property near Gilgandra, New South Wales before being advised to go to art school. He won the Wynne Prize in 1899, and in 1900 he left for Europe having been awarded the NSW Society of Artistsâ€™ Travelling Scholarship. He remained abroad until 1921, studying and working in Paris and London and serving as an official war artist with the Australian Imperial Force. \\n\\n_Self portrait with gladioli_, arguably the most definitive of Lambertâ€™s several self portraits, was painted after he became the first Australian artist elected as an associate of the Royal Academy in London, and following his return to Australia. The artist stands beside a cut-crystal vase arranged with plumes of gladioli, wearing a dandyish corduroy cuffed smoking jacket. In a letter Lambert wrote to his wife Amy in 1921 he plays up to the perceived image of him as foppish aesthete: â€˜I am a luxury, a hot house rarity â€¦ Scoffed at for preciousness. Despised for resembling a chippendale chair in a country where timber is cheap.â€™ And yet, Lambert was a working artist â€“ and his hands, strong and indelicate, are those of a craftsman.",

The elaborate gold frame has a double edge and is approximately 30cm wide with ornate textured, gold foliage decorating the corners and central sections of each side. \\n\\nGeorge is larger than life, from his upper thigh to the crown of his head, wearing a luxurious robe and assuming a flamboyant pose. Standing at ease, his back arched, with one hand on his hip and the other hand extended upwards in an affected gesture. \\n\\nGeorge stands in the centre of the composition, against a matt, deep purple background. His body is on an angle with his left upper arm obscured from view, and his face turned towards us. \\n\\nGeorgeâ€™s hairline is receding. His remaining hair is short and swept back behind his ears, revealing right ear. His hair is light brown, with blond and copper highlights. His pale, dome shaped forehead has a sheen across it. He has a slightly furrowed brow, between full eyebrows, drawn over hazel eyes hooded with heavy eyelids. He looks directly at us with a weary yet quizzical gaze. \\n\\nHis cheeks are flushed a rosy pink and his nose is long and straight with flared nostrils. He has a neat manicured moustache, the ends of which are waxed and turned upwards, extending just beyond the slightly upturned corners of his mouth. His pink, full lips are closed around a black pipe, which dangles from the left-hand side of his mouth. His well- groomed beard follows his jaw line, trimmed close to his cheeks and then from his chin it is longer, thicker and shaped to a blunt point.\\n\\nHe wears a sumptuous old gold velvet smoking jacket with wide, dark taupe corduroy lapels and cuffs, with deep pockets on either side in the front.\\n\\nThe jacket gapes at the front, revealing his slim chest. Around his neck, the stiff high collar of an ivory, cotton dress shirt over which is draped a long violet and white silk scarf and the hint of a dark taupe and gold ribbon.\\n\\nThe velvet fabric hangs in heavy folds around his slight frame, cinched in at the waist with a belt tied in a bow. The jacket is lined with mustard satin that is only visible inside the left sleeve opening. The ample sleeves of the jacket fall back to his wrists, flaunting french cuffs and cuff links. His left arm is held mid-air and crooked at the elbow, palm facing out, fingers stretched up and curled in. \\n\\nHis right hand is deliberately placed on his right hip, with thumb to the rear and fingers with swollen knuckles splayed. \\n\\nIn the lower right-hand corner is a glass vase with a curved handle containing four stems of gladioli of varying lengths and colours red, pink and creamy white. In the lower left-hand corner is the artistâ€™s signature, G. Lambert, Sydney 1922.",

In the late 1950s, she enrolled in painting classes with Graeme Inson, who trained her in the methods of his art teacher, Max Meldrum. On separating from her husband in 1960, she bought her own house in Woollahra, and two years later, Inson moved in. He painted several portraits of Shore, but thought this one best expressed the principles of tonal realism. Inson kept the work and exhibited it repeatedly to demonstrate his style of portraiture to would-be clients and sitters. Through the 1960s, in her own painting Shore moved away from the principles Inson had taught her and began to focus on entering the Portia Geach Memorial Award instead of the Archibald Prize. She won in 1979 with her portrait of trade unionist Della Elliott. Shore used her prize money to have a studio built above the garage of her house, so that she could paint away from Inson and his disapproval of her â€˜non-Meldrumiteâ€™ style. Shore continued to exhibit in the Portia Geach Award until 1992.",

An organiser of the 1899 _9 by 5 Impression Exhibition_ in Melbourne, he promoted the principles of Impressionism and painting en plein air (outdoors). He also advocated for quintessentially Australian subject matter, as seen in his famous landscape paintings such as _Shearing the rams_ and _A break away_. However, portraiture was also an important part of his practice. This portrait of lawyer and judge Sir Alexander Campbell Onslow (1842â€“1908), the third Chief Justice of Western Australia, is thought to be a study for a larger, more formal commissioned work that seems never to have eventuated. It was painted in 1896, the year in which Roberts commenced work on a series of informal portraits of significant figures in Australian society, exhibited as â€˜Familiar faces and figuresâ€™.",

They lost touch before it was completed, and he finished the canvas as a tribute to Neville when he heard the news of her death 30 years later. \\n\\nNeville left Sydney for London in the early 1950s, initially living on a Chelsea houseboat. When her brother Richard Neville arrived in London, she introduced him to people who helped launch the English incarnation of his magazine _Oz_, the first issues of which were published from her Bayswater home. In 1966 she published her first novel, _Fall-Gir_l, which drew on her tumultuous relationships with the poets Peter Porter and Robert Lowell. Moving to Paris the following year, she went on to write six more novels, the last three of which explored the experience of individuals torn between Europe and Australia. Through the 1980s and early 1990s she was a regular reviewer for the _Independent_, the _Times Literary Supplement_, the _Observer_, _London Magazine_ and the _Australian_.",

London-born, she met her future husband Hal Hattam, an Australian obstetrician, in England during the Second World War. After returning to Melbourne, the Hattams established close friendships with a group of emerging artists who have since become household names. At Kateâ€™s behest, artists including John Perceval, Arthur Boyd and Leonard French designed wrapping paper and greeting cards for Georges department store in Melbourne, where she was advertising manager. The Hattam family homes in Canterbury and South Yarra housed a significant collection of works by artists in their circle and beyond. \\n\\nPugh was a close friend of the Hattams and they championed his work. They went regularly to his home, Dunmoochin, on weekends, and also saw the Pughs at Shoreham, where each family had a house. This portrait captures Hattamâ€™s style and determination in Pughâ€™s characteristic elongated forms and bold colour against an abstract background. The artist recalled that it was rare for him to make portraits in this period, â€˜but then of course, I knew Kate so well. It was a picture that I wanted to doâ€™.",

A lot of other painters came back at the same time, so it was a very lively group, not by any means each one in agreement with the other, we had fantastic arguments about the why and wherefore of various theories. Everybody had to somehow earn their living, and it was rather a scramble but we did have a generous atmosphere amongst ourselves which perhaps doesnâ€™t exist in the same way today. When anybody did a good painting, whether you were a rival or not, or somebody was really not quite oneâ€™s friend, everybody went to look at the painting if everybody had come to the conclusion it was a very good painting. We regarded ourselves as a kind of brotherhood, sisterhood if you like, and watched each other with great attention and were glad when anybody got on better because it helped everybody else to get on better.\\n\\nOur friend Peter Bellew became art critic for the Sydney Morning Herald. I think then he had to do some naval work or other and could not go on with the art criticism so they asked my husband whether he would like to try his hand at writing art criticism for the paper. He immediately said, â€˜Oh, why donâ€™t you have my wife as art critic because she speaks the language and does writeâ€™, and the Herald said very charmingly and politely that they were not in the habit of employing women in this function as a critic, and couldnâ€™t contemplate the idea.",

In a review of the exhibition in the _Sydney Morning Herald_, she said: â€˜Disabilities are supposed to take everything from life, to leave it hollow and empty. But they donâ€™t. They make you try all the harder. One makes up oneâ€™s mind to succeed despite the odds, and one does.â€™ After graduation Pecket established a studio in Castlereagh Street, Sydney, where she painted and offered tuition. Later she focused on pottery, producing a range of slip-cast decorative objects under the â€˜Christine Wareâ€™ label. In 1955 Pecket moved to Cammeray, where she built a studio and returned to painting, sculpting and teaching.",

Born at Indulkana in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia, Oâ€™Donoghue was removed from her mother at the age of two and raised in a childrenâ€™s home. The first Aboriginal woman to complete nursing training at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, she travelled to remote communities, learning about her heritage through â€˜just doing what I could to heal peopleâ€™. Among her many achievements, she was Chair of the National Aboriginal Conference, Chair of the Aboriginal Development Commission and Chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, where she helped to draft the Mabo legislation. The Lowitja Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research was established in 2010, and in 2022 formed the Lowitja Oâ€™Donoghue Foundation to continue and preserve its patronâ€™s legacy. For her 2006 portrait by Robert Hannaford, Oâ€™Donoghue chose a red suit that she regularly wore for official occasions, along with jewellery proudly signifying her cultural heritage. Hannaford painted the portrait during several sessions at his studio in Adelaide, and says he aimed to capture his sitterâ€™s â€˜vast understanding and sympathyâ€™.",

But I quickly got to know him and respect him, and I knew that by the questioning and so on that he was really trying to find out more about me. So, Iâ€™m not sure that he knew much about [the] Stolen Generation. After I saw the portrait come out, I myself felt the portrait wasnâ€™t like me because Robert had told me very early in the piece that I wasnâ€™t to smile. He doesnâ€™t like smiling portraits. People who know me of course know that I do smile a lot.\\n\\nThe suit that I wore on the day, I think he was a bit surprised because it was really quite formal and itâ€™s a suit that I wear when I receive the many awards that Iâ€™ve received over the years. My family had no difficulty at all seeing me turn up in that same suit. And because it was a portrait, I thought, well, you know, Iâ€™m an Aboriginal woman and Iâ€™m going to wear the Aboriginal flag, and Iâ€™m going to wear everything red, black and yellow.\\n\\nIâ€™m much more proud of the fact that Iâ€™m a nurse and that I was able to use my nursing experience to actually travel to remote areas in my own, well in my own right, just doing what I could to heal people. I didnâ€™t know my people very well and so on, this is one way of getting to know them out on the APY lands. I have had a lot of senior jobs, met just so many people in high places, really. And I enjoyed seeing them but they werenâ€™t the most important things in my life. It was really about making a difference.",

                "transcript": "This portrait is of Lowitja O'Donoghue, Yankunjatjara woman and Indigenous rights campaigner. It was painted by Robert Hannaford in 2006 in oil on canvas. The work measures about 1.4 m tall by 1.4 m wide, set in its wide frame of dark wood. The portrait is painted realistically with loosely applied brushstrokes. Lowitja wears a bright red skirt-suit and is seated in front of a dark background.\\n\\nThe scene is lit from the top left. Lowitja is illuminated in a soft pool of light filling the top right and centre of the painting. Pale green-grey and blue-grey brush strokes at the top right curve around and down towards the bottom left, their direction changing, sweeping around and getting darker towards the lower edge of the canvas.\\n\\nLowitja sits on a dark wood chair in the centre of the image. The rounded corners of its back rise above each of her shoulders. Her head is tilted slightly down to her left with her chin angled up. Lowitjaâ€™s silvery hair is short, parted on the side, and styled in a wave over her forehead. Her skin is in warm honey tones and her cheeks are tinged pink. Lowitja has fine steeply-arched eyebrows above her dark eyes that gaze directly at us. Her nose is broad and deep grooves flow from it to the outer edges of her thin rosy lips. Her lips are closed and slightly downturned, creating soft jowels which frame her broad chin.\\n\\nIn the portrait Lowitja wears a loosley-fitted long jacket that runs down her lap to her knees. It has an Aboriginal Flag pin on the left lapel and is open, with three large round gold buttons gleaming brightly down its left side. A strand of black red and yellow beads and an oval shaped Aboriginal Flag pendant on a fine chain stand out against her black round-necked top.\\n\\nLowitjaâ€™s elbows rest lightly on the carved wooden arms of the chair and her hands lie with fingers extended in her lap. On the ring finger of her left hand she wears a wide yellow-gold band, while on her right a ring is set with a large black rectangular stone.\\n\\nLowitjaâ€™s red skirt extends over her knees and out of frame. The same red has been used by the artist to sign â€˜Hannaford 06â€™ on the bottom right of the canvas.\\n\\nAudio description written by Lucinda Shawcross and voiced by Amy Middleby",

Her painting _The sock knitter_ (1915), with its flattened picture plane, strong formal qualities and use of vivid colours, is considered the first post-impressionist painting exhibited in this country. During the 1920s Cossington Smith developed her distinctive mosaic-like style by which forms were translated into intricate, rhythmic squares and strokes of colour and light. In the same period she commenced her exhilarating series of paintings of the Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction. \\n\\nBy the time this 1948 self portrait was painted, Cossington Smith had moved from her garden studio at the family home in Sydneyâ€™s Turramurra to one inside the house, resulting in the shimmering paintings of interiors which are characteristic of her later work. Depicting herself in the prime of her long career, the short brushstrokes, laden with paint, build up a strong colour portrait and capture the dedication she felt towards her art in her intense focused gaze and the determined set of her lips.",

Itâ€™s a room with a wardrobe and a bed and a carpet but the chief thing to me was the yellow walls, so that is why I call it _Interior in Yellow_. It was a very exciting thing to do. I wanted to express the forms in colour with the light because the whole thing is meant to express an interior with the light.\\n\\nI use squares in the way I paint, not from a conscious way but it came to me naturally because I feel in that way that light can be put into the colour. whereas just to put colour on to the surface in a flat way, I feel that it gives it a dead look.\\n\\nThe room is in my own home here and the sunlight did not come in in a definite way but the whole room seemed to be full of light, which is what I want to do more than the actual sunlight. I feel that even the shadows are a subdued light and they must have light in them as well as the light parts.",

                "transcript": "This self-portrait of the painter Grace Cossington Smith, was made in 1948, with oil on cardboard, and measures 57cm high and 48cm wide. The prominent frame is dark wood, and between it and the painting is a second, narrow, inner frame of bone coloured canvas.\\n\\nThe dynamism in this portrait comes from the way it has been painted - with small, squarish, paint-laden brush strokes in warm yellows and browns, that seem to flicker and move â€“ dancing across the surface of the canvas. In contrast, Grace appears rather quiet and unremarkable, looking out, through round rimmed glasses, and dressed in a collared shirt. \\n\\nGraceâ€™s head and upper torso dominate the portrait. Behind her, the top half of the painting shows a light filled, green and yellow dappled background, while the bottom half is mostly darker tones, and includes a warm, deep-brown coloured object â€“ possibly the back of a chair. \\n\\nGrace has cropped hair, parted at the centre, and tucked behind her ears. Though it is neat, there is the impression of a wavy texture - created through layered brush strokes in mottled copper-browns, yellow-greens and deep-blues. Graceâ€™s oval face is tilted slightly up, and the right side is angled to the viewer, with light falling on it. Her forehead is high, rounded and smooth. Graceâ€™s eyebrows are obscured by her slender, brown-framed, round-rimmed glasses. \\n\\nThrough the lenses, Graceâ€™s gaze is striking â€“ her eyes are brown and almond shaped, and their look is direct; unfaltering. Perhaps the intense stare is aimed at the viewer, or perhaps at herself, as she works on her portrait, scrutinising her reflection in a mirror.\\n\\nGrace has a straight nose. Her natural-pink lips are pursed, and set in a serious expression. \\n\\nA pink brush stroke defines the curve of Graceâ€™s small, round chin. Three brown flecks give shape to the right side of her jaw, and vertical, smudged dabs in yellow-brown and pink, allude to the slackening skin of the neck of a woman in her mid-fifties. \\n\\nThe collar of Graceâ€™s shirt fits close to her neck, and comes together in a â€˜vâ€™. On Graceâ€™s right side, where the light touches it, the front of her shirt is painted in whites, pale pinks and browns, while on her left side, deep reds and patches of dark blue-green indicate shadows. \\n\\nThe bottom edge of the portrait crops Grace off mid-chest. In the left corner, beneath the short sleeve of her shirt, is her bare right arm.\\n\\nIn front of Graceâ€™s left shoulder, in the lower right corner of the painting there are three flat, rectangular shaped objects layered against each other. The objectsâ€™ shapes and positions suggest they are the yellow backs of two cardboard canvasses leaning against a brown, timber easel.",

She went to London in 1934, studying at the Central School of Art and the Byam Shaw School before returning to Australia and winning the 1938 Archibald Prize â€“ the first woman to do so. In 1943 she became the first woman appointed to work as an official war artist. While in New Guinea she met Dr Robert Black (1917â€“1988), who she married in Sydney in 1953. Professor of Tropical Medicine in the Commonwealth Institute of Health, University of Sydney from 1963 to 1982, his research and work with the World Health Organisation was instrumental in controlling malaria in the armed forces in Australia and in developing countries.

Leason completed an apprenticeship as a lithographic artist in Melbourne, making illustrations for advertisements before turning to book illustration. He also attended night classes at the National Gallery School. After moving to Sydney in 1917, Leasonâ€™s paintings and etchings were purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales and he became a political cartoonist at the _Bulletin_. Perturbed by the â€˜new waveâ€™ of modernism sweeping Sydney, he returned to Melbourne in 1924, building a house in Eltham which became a hub for artists, writers and performers. Australiaâ€™s highest-paid cartoonist at that time, his political cartoons appeared in _Punch_, _Table Talk_ and the _Bulletin_. In 1938 Leason moved to the USA and settled in Staten Island, New York, where he established an art school, conducting art classes in realist tonal painting.",

In creating this portrait of author David Malouf AO (b. 1934), Amor says he aimed first, to produce a good likeness; and secondly, â€˜in a world full of enormous headsâ€™, a quiet picture of a diffident man of intellect. The modest scale of the portrait imparts a sense of intimacy and calm, offering a gentle portrayal of the sitter. Malouf is best known for his novels: _An imaginary life_ won the 1979 NSW Premierâ€™s Literary Award; _Fly away Peter_ was named the Age Book of the Year in 1982; _The great world_ won the Miles Franklin Award in 1990; _Remembering Babylon_ was shortlisted for the 1994 Booker Prize; and _The conversations at Curlow Creek_ was nominated for the Miles Franklin Award in 1997.",

So, he was looking behind the sociable gesture or the sociable person for, I think, the person who does the writing, who is often a quite secret self and mysterious and unknown even to the person who does the writing. That is, you know, the place the writing comes from is somewhere different from your social self.\\n\\nWhen youâ€™re a writer you have to discover how your own imagination works and how you can recreate on the page something that will stir the readerâ€™s imagination in the same way. Of course, because itâ€™s language thatâ€™s very, very much to do with rhythm and with cadence and things like that and I donâ€™t make a distinction between how important rhythm is in say poetry to how important it is in prose as well. And I think of almost everything I write, including the short stories or novels or even a piece of non-fictional prose, I think of that as being, when Iâ€™m writing it, as being something that will be read aloud, and read aloud in the readerâ€™s mind even if they donâ€™t think that thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re doing.\\n\\nI grew up in a generation where our visual imagination was absolutely stimulated and decided by film. And so almost always, I think, when Iâ€™m writing, I see whatâ€™s there as if it were either a still from a film or an unfolding piece of action in the film.",

He chose to represent a person that he saw as being inward rather than expressing what's really going on there in some kind of outward or theatrical or flamboyant gesture.\\n\\nOf course, before the portrait was made, I knew Rick's work. I was little surprised that he was the person who wanted to do the portrait, because I didn't know the portraits very well. What I knew was his interest in spaces, so I was bit curious when he approached me about it. The work that I really knew his was much more abstract than that, not abstract in its texture but in its interest.\\n\\nMy chief memory of the sessions was really what were very interesting conversations, in which I just had to talk and he did the work while he talked. I understand that, because it's a way of making the conscious mind work in one way and the hand work in another. I understand that very well from what you do with writing.\\n\\nI didn't see the painting then until it was exhibited in Sydney which happened to be at Sherman's Gallery. I was surprised that it was smaller than I thought the picture had been that he was working on, and I was also very surprised by its quietness. Where it demands attention is that, if you are actually to see what's going on in it, you have to come quite close and you have to engage with it in a very quiet and personal way. That's the point at which you actually see that there's so much more going on, on that canvas.\\n\\nA sense of space is often something that is a cue to a feeling or to a perception that's they are somewhere buried and that you've got to allow to come up. The writer, for example, has to be unafraid of the emptiness of his mind, because out of that emptiness that something he doesn't yet know is going to come, so the space almost seems part of what is presented in the body and the face. There's that kind of emptiness in the background.\\n\\nIf you're looking for some of those clues that you get in conventional portraits of the social world or the social status or the interests of the sitter, those are deliberately taken away. He was looking behind the sociable gesture or the sociable person for, I think, the person who does the writing and he lets his inward vision work to create the portrait.",

In March 1945 he sang on a radio talent quest, _Australiaâ€™s Amateur Hour_, gaining a record number of votes, and within months he was accepted by the Melbourne (Melba) Conservatorium of Music. He then studied at the Juilliard School in New York, performing in a benefit concert at the New York Town Hall in early 1951. Back in Australia, he appeared as a guest artist for the ABCâ€™s three-year Jubilee Tour of Australia and later taught at the Melba Conservatorium. Increasingly focused on First Nations rights, he served on the Aboriginesâ€™ Welfare Board in Victoria in the late 1950s, and was involved in the Aborigines Advancement League, the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the Commonwealth Aboriginal Arts Board. In 1973, he won praise for his performance in _Dalgerie_, the first ever opera staged at the Sydney Opera House.",

Heleâ€™s treatment of the paint, particularly to depict Buttfieldâ€™s luxurious fur coat and poised demeanour, combined with the warm palette, captures her strength but also reveals an alluring quality. \\n\\nThe daughter of car industry pioneer Sir Edward Holden, Buttfieldâ€™s interest in politics was encouraged by her father, a state parliamentarian, and family friend Robert Menzies. In 1954, she was endorsed as the Liberal Party candidate for Adelaide, unsuccessfully contesting the seat in the federal election that year. When a senate seat fell vacant in 1955, she was elected to parliament as a Liberal senator for South Australia, serving from 1955â€“65 and again from 1968â€“74, where she lobbied on issues such as equal pay for women. She was the first female senator to visit the Soviet Union and toured China alone in 1962. After her retirement she served on many boards and made philanthropic contributions to youth and the arts.",

An August 1856 review of his Liverpool Street â€˜Portrait Galleryâ€™ stated that â€˜the portraits issuing from this studio excel anything witnessed before in this colonyâ€™. Like many successful colonists in Hobart, William Robertson senior commissioned several local artists to record his family, including this portrait of his son William Robertson (1839â€“1892). Robertson senior had emigrated to Van Diemenâ€™s Land in 1824 and in the mid-1830s invested in a scheme to expand pastoral activities to Port Phillip. He eventually moved his family to an estate near Colac, called The Hill, building it into one of Victoriaâ€™s leading cattle studs. William Robertson junior, a lawyer and politician, inherited the Colac property on his fatherâ€™s death in 1874; two years later he retired as a barrister and with his three brothers focused on the management of the family properties. He was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly in the 1870s and 1880s.",

One of Australiaâ€™s famous expatriates of the 1960s, he settled in London in 1964, writing for _The Times_, _The Spectator_, _The Observer_ and _Oz_, and publishing his book _The Art of Australia_ (1966). Appointed art critic for _Time_ magazine, he moved to New York in 1970 and lived in the USA for the rest of his life. Hughes is perhaps best known for his television series _The Shock of the New_ (1980), which introduced modern art to a mass audience.",

She met the English novelist Ford Madox Ford in 1917 and their daughter Julia was born in 1920. Bowen essentially gave up painting, with her daughter (and Fordâ€™s career as a writer) becoming the focus. After the couple separated in 1928, Bowen became dependent on her painting for an income. She travelled to the USA in 1932, completing several portrait commissions before returning to Europe and eking out a living with painting, reviewing and teaching in England and France. \\n\\nThis self-reflective work, painted when Bowen was in her 40s, projects undemonstrative confidence. Bowenâ€™s palette is soft and light, finding the earthy and muted tones she had loved when she travelled to Italy in 1923 and encountered the work of 14th-century Italian artists such as Giotto. Her ongoing fascination with Giottoâ€™s technique is evident in the thin layering of pigment. The green blouse is so briefly articulated; the overall form, collar and loose ties drawn in with the lightest dry brush over pencil lines. Bowen uses a sketchy, painterly style with fine scratches adding texture and dimension to the work.",

He trained at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, the AcadÃ©mie de la Grand ChaumiÃ¨re in Paris and George Bellâ€™s school in Melbourne before moving to Sydney in 1941. There he studied at East Sydney Technical College, where he met Margaret Olley, who became a lifelong friend. Strachan was one of the group of artists who travelled regularly to the abandoned NSW mining town of Hill End, and during the war he worked as a camouflage painter at Bankstown aerodrome with other artists such as William Dobell. His first solo exhibition, held at the Macquarie Galleries in 1944, included this poetic self portrait, which demonstrates his recurring fascination with flowers and angelic figures emerging out of darkness. In the 1960s, following a decade living in Paris and London, Strachan taught at East Sydney Tech and exhibited regularly, winning the Wynne Prize for landscape painting in 1961 and 1964.",

Head of the intermediate art department at East Sydney Technical College from 1938 to 1961, he published _Study of Australian Art_ in 1949 and _A Gallery of Australian Art_ in 1954. In this small-scale self portrait set in a domestic interior, Badham sits facing the viewer with a pipe held between his lips while he pulls on a brown leather glove. A mirror hanging on the wall behind him introduces his companion, possibly his wife Enid, who appeared in another self portrait from 1937.",

Having exhibited at the 1922 Salon in Paris while undertaking studies at the Royal Academy in London, Perry had returned to Sydney in 1925 where she opened her own art school and became a founding member of the Australian Academy of Art. Known for her modernist landscapes and prints, Perry also painted many portraits of her female friends. Here Roxburgh wears a soft cream blouse with mother of pearl buttons and delicate floral motif, which is set against the strong verticals of a striped wallpaper. Her gaze is steady, yet not quite looking at us. At the time, Roxburgh was exhibiting her work with the Contemporary Group, Society of Artists and at the Macquarie Galleries. During the Second World War she qualified as a nurse at Sydney Hospital, before spending a decade in London, studying at the Central and Hammersmith art schools. Also a conservationist and heritage campaigner, Roxburgh later served on the executive of the National Trust (NSW) and contributed to the identification and classification of colonial architectural heritage.",

The corners are raised and decorated in a foliage design. \\n\\nThe portraitâ€™s strong, striped background in cool colours contrasts with a sensitive depiction of the figure of Rachel Roxburgh. Seated on a settee, rendered in warm peaches and creams Rachelâ€™s image is cropped at the bust, filling the majority of the canvas.\\n\\nThe background is a vertical repeating design of thick taupe, teal and almost-black lines. An unseen object casts a faint shadow behind her right shoulder. Just the curve of a reddish-brown high-backed settee is partially shown behind her left shoulder. \\n\\nHer brunette hair is pulled off her face, elegantly piled on her head in a loose rolled wave, revealing her ears. She has a high forehead with lightly arched brown brows and deep hooded round, light green eyes.\\n\\nShe gazes intently outwards over our right shoulder. Her complexion is creamy, with her nose and cheeks a blushing peach. Her full lips are coated in a vivid coral lipstick. Her chin and jawline are softly rounded and also flushed pink. The arch of her eyebrows and slight upturn of the upper lip makes her appear thoughtful.  \\n  \\nRachel wears a cream pussy-bow blouse with an understated white floral design and a line of greyish buttons. Puff sleeves stop midway down her upper arm, emphasising her broad shoulders. On the garment, taupe and dusky pink shadows emphasise the loosely draping neckline and the trail of buttons down her front. \\n\\nA signature in bright red is painted in the bottom right, A. E. Perry, 39.",

In the background of this portrait of Carl Cooper (1912â€“1966), under a lowering sky, appear motifs characteristic of Boydâ€™s work: a flying creature and denuded trees. This psychologically intense painting conveys Cooperâ€™s deep mental and physical discomfort.\\n\\nCooper studied at the East Sydney Technical College and the Royal College of Art in London. He contracted poliomyelitis in his twenties and lost the use of his legs. In hospital he met the artist John Perceval, who introduced him to the Boyd family. Arthur Merric Boyd and Perceval had opened the AMB pottery near the Boyd family home in Murrumbeena, just outside Melbourne, in the mid-1940s, where Cooper began making incised earthenware pieces. Arthur Boyd recollected Cooper as a â€˜dissatisfied, fierce, crushedâ€™ figure, a sentiment he has captured in this portrait. Cooper eventually set up his own studio, but illness forced him to cease production in 1963.",

On his return to Australia after a decade he managed to impress both conservative and modernist art factions with his powerful, expressive paintings. He won the Archibald Prize three times, although his first win, for his painting of Joshua Smith, was challenged by claims that it was a caricature, not a portrait. The court eventually found in Dobellâ€™s favour.\\n\\nA friend and patron of Dobell, Sir Charles Lloyd Jones â€“ the grandson of the original David Jones, who founded the department store in Sydney in 1838 â€“ commissioned the artist to paint several family portraits, including this one of his eldest son David Lloyd Jones (1931â€“1961). Charles Lloyd Jones was chairman of David Jones Ltd from 1920 until his death in 1958. David was 17 when his father began preparing him as his successor. In 1954, aged 23, he became the youngest director of David Jones in the firmâ€™s history. Following his fatherâ€™s death he became Deputy Chairman and joint Managing Director of David Jones Ltd; in 1960, he was appointed Chairman. A year later he died, aged 30, within weeks of being diagnosed with cancer.",

In Streetâ€™s posture and firm gaze, Jerrold-Nathan has suggested her warmth as well as her resolve and resilience. \\n\\nStreetâ€™s 50-year career encompassed achievements on landmark issues such as family planning, equal pay and equal employment. In the interwar years she advocated for unemployment relief, the plight of Jewish refugees and the rights of First Nations peoples. In 1945, she was the sole Australian woman delegate to the founding of the United Nations. Her husband, Sir Kenneth Street, was Chief Justice of NSW from 1950, and for much of the 1950s she worked for the World Peace Council in London. This portrait was displayed in the Street family home in Sydney and for many years it was on loan to the Jessie Street National Womenâ€™s Library in Ultimo.",

After all, the trade union movement is supposed to represent both the men and the women in jobs. There must be amongst their membership, the same number of intelligent women as there are intelligent men. And I would very much hope to see in the future â€“ I donâ€™t suppose itâ€™ll come in my lifetime â€“ that they have the proper distribution of places of influence between men and women both in the governing bodies of unions, and also, later on, when things gets more socialistic, in the governing body of the industries themselves.\\n\\nNow I say, â€˜get more socialisticâ€™, there because many years ago I became a socialist. I read quite a lot of books about politics and so on and so forth, and it seemed to me to be the system under which the individual, whether a man or a woman, had the greatest opportunity of developing their usefulness and status. You only have to look back in history in the days of serfdom and all the rest of it. Itâ€™s as theyâ€™ve gradually overcome the limitations that were placed on them by the social system, that not only women have advanced but society itself has advanced. And of course, if you come to think of it, men and women are both components of society and if you have a horse with a lame foot or a shackled foot itâ€™s not going to gallop was well as one that hasnâ€™t got, who hasnâ€™t got any shackles on. And itâ€™s the same with the human race â€“ if youâ€™re going to shackle the women, as they have been in the past and to a certain extent still are, youâ€™re going to hold up the progress of the whole of our society.",

To render the colour and texture exactly, he cut a sample of fabric from the hem of the dress. The artist made three paintings of her; she acquired this one for herself and displayed it at her home in New York City. \\n\\nRubinstein started one of the worldâ€™s first global cosmetic companies, Helena Rubinstein, in Melbourne in 1902, after moving to Australia from Poland in 1896. Her first beauty salon specialised in a product said to contain rare herbs from eastern Europe, but which was made with lanolin from local sheep fleeces, â€˜vegetable oil, mineral oil and waxâ€™. From 1908 she opened salons in London, Paris and New York. Other stand-alone and department store salons followed. Integral to Rubinsteinâ€™s success was her awareness that she was the most effective ambassador for the brand. Her wardrobe, consequently, included gowns by the most illustrious designers. In her 1964 memoir, Rubinstein described Sutherlandâ€™s portraits as â€˜incredibly bold, domineering interpretations of what I had never imagined I looked likeâ€™, but conceded that â€˜as paintings they were indeed masterpiecesâ€™.",

Helena is seated, her head held high, a mature woman exuding glamour and style wearing a sumptuous, ruby-red gown juxtaposed against a dove grey background. \\n\\nHelena Rubensteinâ€™s body is turned slightly, her left side more prominently displayed and she gazes out of the portrait to her right, looking rather tense. Her mid-length black hair is pulled tightly back, her sleek up-do highlights her high forehead and clearly visible grey hairs just above her left ear. Her thick hair is tied at her nape, soft curls gather in a black ribbon hugging the back of her neck.\\n\\nFurrows mark the commencement of an arch to each small, well-kept eyebrow. There are creases in the soft skin around her dark eye on the left side of her face. Here, her complexion is smooth and liberally dusted with pink blusher. She has wide nostrils and a prominent nose casting a thin shadow onto her (barely visible) right cheek. \\n\\nHelenaâ€™s olive skin shows signs of age at the corners of her thin, ruby-red mouth and noticeably defined jowl. A patch of shadow accentuates the soft, vertical folds in the paper-thin skin of her neck. \\n\\nShe has large ears and creases nose to mouth-corners. She holds herself rigid, ill-at-ease, maintaining proud posture and staring beyond us. \\n\\nHer face is made up and black/brown lines outline neat eyebrows, her eyelids and eye lashes. Her nose and chin tilt upwards. Her thin lips are closed and brightly outlined in red. \\n\\nOn her left ear is a large tear-drop shaped earring encrusted with pearls and diamonds. A sumptuous 5-stringed pearl necklace caresses her neck and the lower strands rest on the material of her dress. \\n\\nTwo large oval shaped rings adorn both stiffly crossed hands resting on her lap. Her left hand holds a 5cm gold, leaf-shaped object.\\n\\nHelenaâ€™s rich, ruby-red brocade gown by designer Balenciago bears a detailed floral pattern in shades of gold, white, light blues and greens. The bodice has a high neckline, three-quarter sleeves and flairs out over the skirt at hip level. Helenaâ€™s full skirt drapes loosely around her hips and upper legs, occupying the whole lower quarter of the portrait.  \\n  \\nThe dressâ€™s floral pattern becomes less and less defined towards the bottom edge of the portrait, disseminating to smudged shades of paler reds, orange and pinks as it continues to flow from the seated woman out beyond the bottom edge of the picture frame.\\n\\nThe artist â€“ Graham Sutherland has signed his work in the bottom right corner of the canvas.",

Working with Tracey Holmes (b. 1966) and Stan Grant (b. 1963), Walker set out to create a portrait of the couple that would â€˜document their story of love and connection, culture and placeâ€™. \\n\\nStan Grant, Wiradjuri/Kamilaroi journalist, presenter, filmmaker and author, and his partner Tracey Holmes, a sports broadcaster and journalist, are depicted wrapped in fur pelts on Country. Infused with golden light, the pair are grounded on the Yarrangobilly River at a meeting place for the Ngunnawal and Wiradjuri peoples. Itâ€™s a place where Grantâ€™s heritage connects with Holmesâ€™ links to her Chinese ancestors, who settled in the district in the 19th century. As Grant revealed when the work was first displayed: â€˜Where we are is as important, if not more important, than who we are â€¦ Itâ€™s not just a love story between us, itâ€™s a love story of Country, and what Country means to so many people.â€™",

When this photograph was taken, McAllister was the Australian Balletâ€™s artistic director in Melbourne and Enoch was the director of the Sydney Festival. They maintained a policy of never going more than three weeks without seeing each other â€“ somewhere. Peter Brew-Bevan wanted his portrait of them to capture this together-but-apart aspect of their relationship, while at the same time conveying â€˜their very strong bond and love for each otherâ€™. This is suggested by their poses and body language: seated together but looking away from each other and connected only through their hands. The esky in which McAllister appears to be icing his foot symbolises his â€˜hard physical commitment and dedication to danceâ€™, while Wesleyâ€™s T-shirt is a statement of his uncompromising advocacy for First Nations culture and creativity. McAllister left the Australian Ballet in late 2020 after almost 40 years with the company, while the 2021 Sydney Festival marked the end of Enochâ€™s tenure as festival director. â€˜I have Wesley by my side,â€™ McAllister wrote at the time, â€˜and Iâ€™m looking forward to us becoming old men together.â€™",

Dad was an accountant, Mum was my mum and I have brothers and sisters that there's no artistic sort of dance background in our family at all. So, I was this sort of mutant child who, you know, used to dance around the house all the time and I used to dance in front of the TV when the TV was off so I could see myself, you know, moving around. And whenever there was a family gathering, I was always putting on a show and annoying the hell out of everyone. So, I guess it was in my DNA and I didn't really have a plan B. Iâ€™d started training when I was seven. I didn't realize that all the other boys at school wouldn't think it was quite as cool as what I did. So, that was, a life journey. But yeah, I just love to dance. And I guess ballet, because I saw some ballet on TV, which was Rudolf Nureyev doing Don Quixote with the Australian Ballet. And I went, Oh, that's the sort of dance I want to do. And then I went to a ballet school and 10 years later I was in Melbourne at the Australian Ballet School. And two years later I joined the company.\\n\\nI've got to say the first time I saw that portrait, I was just in awe really. I'd seen all of the preparatory work that Peter had done through his journals and diaries and things, and he talked a lot about it. So, I guess I knew that the dance element would be as it was, and it was incredibly beautiful. But I had no idea of what I'd look like. And it was really, really amazing. He caught a moment that sort of not, I guess what people would think necessarily is a former dancer and, a, you know, artistic director, because we tend to be on, you know, sort of like â€˜Welcome to the balletâ€™. And it was sort of more of a pensive moment. And I really liked that â€™cos, you know, I feel like it's the side of me that sometimes people don't get to see. And so it's beautiful that it's the side that he's shown.",

He caught a moment that's sort of not, I guess, what people would think necessarily as a former dancer and artistic director because we tend to be on. And it was sort of more of a pensive moment, and I really liked that 'cause I feel like it's this side of me that sometimes people don't get to see. I guess I've done a lot of portrait photographs in my life. Peter was amazing because he made it so comfortable like I didn't even really notice that he was taking the photos. We were just talking, and it almost felt like it wasn't a photo session except for the fact that I had really good make-up on, and someone had done my hair really nicely, so... And I think what was really nice is 'cause I was involved a little bit in helping them make the shapes, I mean we did lots and lots and lots of moving photographs to make the piece around me. And so I was sort of involved in that 'cause I couldn't help myself but go, \"Why don't you try this, \"and why don't you throw that leg up?\" So that was sort of fun. I was one of those weird kids that just always wanted to dance. And my family, you know, fantastic, very wonderful people. Mum and Dad, Dad was an accountant, Mum was my mum. And I have brothers and sisters that there's no artistic sort of dance background in our family at all. So I was sort of this mutant child who used to dance around the house all the time, and I used to dance in front of the TV when the TV was off, so I could see myself moving around. I didn't really have a plan B. I started training when I was seven. I saw some ballet on TV, which was Rudolf Nureyev doing Don Quixote with the Australian Ballet, and I went, \"Oh, that's the sort of dance I wanna do.\" It's not until you step off the stage that you realise how amazing it is because, you know, the curtain goes up, and even if you feel like you haven't done your best, there is this sense of great appreciation. And it really humbles you that people can react to you in that way. We have such a privilege to do what we do, and then to have the extra acknowledgement, I guess, of an audience to be so generous with their response is quite amazing. So it is something that you never forget, and it's addictive, I've gotta say. Something that your sort of miss when you stop dancing, you know? When I finish my day at the office now and get up from my desk, there's no one applauding anymore. It's like, but I feel lucky that I had that experience. I had a number of career-ending injuries, which luckily I managed to get through. When I was 26, I blew a disc in my back. And after nine months of really slow rehab and therapy and getting myself back into dancing again, I danced for another 11 years. So it was an extraordinary experience. And then the next time I had a big period like that was when I tore my cruciate ligament in my left knee. I think those injuries really taught me a lot about myself and my endurance, and I guess my passion for dancing. But it also set up the career that I now have. So when I was off, I would do things around the ballet company. I'd go to sponsorship functions, and patron functions, and be around the administration. So it sort of began my passion, I guess, for the other side of the organisation, the non-performance side. And now, as artistic director, I think I did my apprenticeship through those injuries. Kids loved to dance. You know, you go to a pre-primary class and you put music on and they all start dancing. And then somehow throughout school-age and teenagers we sort of lose that. You know, we've told to sit down and not move, and anyone that just spontaneously dances, it's sort of seen as being a bit weird. But I think anything that brings dance out of people is really fantastic, and I love that. When you go and see a performance, it's not just what the artists do on stage, it's how you interpret it, so it's interactive. And it can be very seductive, and it's very physical, but it's also very emotional, and, I think, quite visceral that you actually have this opportunity to see people without words telling complex stories.",

00:03:27.947\\ndo things around the ballet company.\\n\\n76\\n00:03:27.947 --> 00:03:30.879\\nI'd go to sponsorship functions, and patron functions,\\n\\n77\\n00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.253\\nand be around the administration.\\n\\n78\\n00:03:34.253 --> 00:03:36.930\\nSo it sort of began my passion, I guess,\\n\\n79\\n00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.834\\nfor the other side of the

--> 00:04:01.202\\nand teenagers we sort of lose that.\\n\\n88\\n00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:03.222\\nYou know, we've told to sit down and not move,\\n\\n89\\n00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:06.254\\nand anyone that just spontaneously dances,\\n\\n90\\n00:04:06.254 --> 00:04:09.459\\nit's sort of seen as being a bit weird.\\n\\n91\\n00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.322 line:15% \\nBut I think anything that brings dance\\n\\n92\\n00:04:12.322 --> 00:04:16.373 line:15% \\nout of people is really fantastic, and I love that.\\n\\n93\\n00:04:16.373 --> 00:04:17.922\\nWhen you go and see a performance,\\n\\n94\\n00:04:17.922 --> 00:04:20.202\\nit's not just what the artists do on stage,\\n\\n95\\n00:04:20.202 --> 00:04:23.143\\nit's how you interpret it, so it's interactive.\\n\\n96\\n00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:27.310\\nAnd it can be very seductive, and it's very physical,\\n\\n97\\n00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:32.704\\nbut it's also very emotional, and, I think, quite visceral\\n\\n98\\n00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:36.613\\nthat you actually have this opportunity to see\\n\\n99\\n00:04:36.613 --> 00:04:40.363\\npeople without words telling complex stories.\\n\\n",

Australiaâ€™s most successful band ever, AC/DC was signed to an international deal in 1975 but American success did not come until â€˜Highway to Hellâ€™ reached number 17 on the US charts in 1979. Scott told photographer Rennie Ellis in 1978 that he could see no end to the â€˜rollicking adventureâ€™, but two years later Scottâ€™s hard-partying lifestyle caught up with him â€“ officially he died of acute alcohol poisoning. His grave in Fremantle is the most-visited grave in Australia. In 2004, UK magazine _Classic Rock_ rated Scott as number one in a list of the 100 Greatest Frontmen. Significantly, however, and largely thanks to Angus Youngâ€™s star status, the band weathered the loss of Scott and his replacement with Brian Johnston. AC/DCâ€™s _Back in Black_, issued five months after Scottâ€™s death, is said to be the second-highest-selling album of all time worldwide.",

In this photograph, the artist appears with his first wife, Joy Hester (1920â€“1960). Like Tucker, Hester had a vigorous and deeply felt approach to making art. They were both part of the group of artists and thinkers centred around Heide, the home of arts patrons John and Sunday Reed on the outskirts of Melbourne. During her lifetime, Hesterâ€™s work was overshadowed by those of her male contemporaries, but it is now widely acknowledged, especially her drawings, which are characterised by their intense emotion and spare, simple gestures. Hesterâ€™s life was beset by sadness. Diagnosed with Hodgkinâ€™s disease at the age of 27, she left Tucker for a fellow artist, Gray Smith. Despite her prognosis, she continued to work through the 13 years until her death at the age of 40.",

I think itâ€™s answering an inner compulsion, because if I didnâ€™t find this particular form of activity â€“ to me itâ€™s one that is defining things to myself and defining myself â€“ Iâ€™m not quite sure what would happen to me if I didnâ€™t answer this kind of inner compulsion. And I suppose it relates to oneâ€™s attitude to life. I think that, despite all the negative and destructive powers that are constantly at work with us, that one is constantly striving to affirm life, to be in love with it, and these are the tokens of affection on our way, as it were.\\n\\nThe question of why I paint the particular things I do is also pretty ambiguous. I think I would say that Iâ€™m trying to exorcise my own particular devils, and I suppose some of them get into the painting. I hope they do, thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m trying to put them, and get rid of them.\\n\\nBut once out, of course, one can then feel this kind of relaxation, the affirmation flows in, and the devils in the painting can sometimes turn into angels.\\n\\nI suppose in the act of work that it is essentially a struggle to escape the enmeshment of oneâ€™s ego, and in the attempt to struggle free one seems externally, to the external world, to be a very egocentric person, because youâ€™re following a necessary compulsion without which one loses oneâ€™s own balance and direction in life; and in the act of working one is defining these shapes, ejecting them as it were, and getting rid of them; and this process of ejectment is one there which is defining and clarifying oneâ€™s own particular kind of energy which you are attempting to flow out into life.",

Both were unswerving in their lifelong commitment to advancing the rights of First Nations people. Quandamooka woman and esteemed poet Noonuccal was a leading voice in the charge for nationwide recognition of Australiaâ€™s First Nations people, including the campaign for the 1967 Referendum for constitutional change and co-founding the National Tribal Council. An early career in nursing ultimately led Yankunjatjara woman Oâ€™Donoghue into First Nations advocacy and public administration. She worked with the Australian government on Native Title, was the inaugural chair of both the National Aboriginal Conference and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and helped draft the Mabo legislation. In her powerful Australia Day Address on 24 January 2000, Oâ€™Donoghue said â€˜my dearest hope is that I may be able to contribute to positive changeâ€™. Murri photographer Mervyn Bishop took this double portrait at the National Aboriginal Conference in Canberra in April 1978, as part of his groundbreaking work for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.",

Itâ€™s easy to put a mark on a ballot paper, and I must say this definitely, that there was a small minority group of sincere Australian people but I would say 75 [per cent] of those who voted Yes did it to clear their guilty conscience.\\n\\nIncidentally, itâ€™s interesting to understand why those terrible discriminative laws were put into the books. In the first place, our civic fathers, or the white manâ€™s civic fathers of long ago, during the â€˜soothing of the dying pillowâ€™ era, the politicians, or the statesmen of that time, were writing over to Queen Victoria saying, â€˜The Aborigine is dying out.â€™ And true, he was â€“ they were poisoning him with strychnine in the waterholes and they were shooting him, and they were doing all sorts of things. And the Aborigine dropped from 300,000 strong to 80,000 in a very short period of time. So it was quite natural for them to say the Aborigine was a dying race.\\n\\nNow it was during this period of time that the Constitution was being fixed, and as they thought we were a dying race, to save themselves a lot of bother they said, â€˜Well we will not count the Aborigines and we do not have to make laws for the Aborigines, because theyâ€™re going to die out anywayâ€™. And this is the reason today why Aboriginals have not had any education, any decent housing, any facilities that the white Australian enjoys today. Itâ€™s because of that stupid business of thinking the Aboriginals were going to die out.\\n\\nMind you, the Aboriginals are a determined lot, and theyâ€™re quite ungrateful. They didnâ€™t die, they lived on and are still living on; in spite of the many attempts to commit genocide and assassinate us all, we are still here. I think weâ€™ll last the white man out, truly.",

                "transcript": "In 1965 I think it was, we were invited to go in and talk to the then prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies. There was a deputation from all over Australia of Aboriginal spokesmen and women and we did go in. Sir Robert Menzies had told the public and the politicians, the people of the House, that he would not have a referendum in his lifetime as prime minister. Heâ€™d been badly beaten on the referendum before where he had appealed to the people to outlaw Communism and when the people said â€˜No outlawing of the Communist Partyâ€™, Sir Robert Menzies refused then to have anything to do with referendums in his lifetime as prime minister.\\n\\nWe lobbied the House of Parliament and itâ€™s to their discredit, really, that when we asked them to bring out the laws concerning the Aboriginal people that there was no laws, no books on the Aboriginal people in their archives or libraries, and they had to quickly have them printed, so that the politicians could read what it was, for and against the Aborigines. There was one, however, on the national â€“ the Canberra law book saying that if Aboriginals go into Canberra, any Justice of the Peace could declare them illegal immigrants into Canberra and they could be chased out of Canberra. This still applied to us, incidentally, at this period of time. And we always made a joke of it when we went to Canberra, you know, â€˜If you get into trouble, you know the law on the book. If a JP says Get Out, make sure you get your blanket,â€™ because the law still said that before sending them out of Canberra, they must first issue them with one government blanket. So we were determined weâ€™d get our government blanket if ever they threw us out.  \\nWe told everyone this and we made it a laughingstock â€“ Canberra a laughingstock â€“ to such an extent that the first thing Sir Robert Menzies did was delete that off the Canberra constitution. So itâ€™s no longer there.",

So, Iâ€™m not sure that he knew much about [the] Stolen Generation. After I saw the portrait come out, I myself felt the portrait wasnâ€™t like me because Robert had told me very early in the piece that I wasnâ€™t to smile. He doesnâ€™t like smiling portraits. People who know me of course know that I do smile a lot.\\n\\nThe suit that I wore on the day, I think he was a bit surprised because it was really quite formal and itâ€™s a suit that I wear when I receive the many awards that Iâ€™ve received over the years. My family had no difficulty at all seeing me turn up in that same suit. And because it was a portrait, I thought, well, you know, Iâ€™m an Aboriginal woman and Iâ€™m going to wear the Aboriginal flag, and Iâ€™m going to wear everything red, black and yellow.\\n\\nIâ€™m much more proud of the fact that Iâ€™m a nurse and that I was able to use my nursing experience to actually travel to remote areas in my own, well in my own right, just doing what I could to heal people. I didnâ€™t know my people very well and so on, this is one way of getting to know them out on the APY lands. I have had a lot of senior jobs, met just so many people in high places, really.

It was taken by Mervyn Bishop. It is a gelatin silver photograph on paper and measures approximately 30 centimetres high by 30 centimetres wide.\\n\\nThe photograph shows Oodgeroo and Lowitja smiling broadly, standing side by side in front of an intricately patterned wallpaper. \\n\\nIn this black and white image the background wallpaper has a light-toned pattern of vertical stripes and floral paisley designs.\\n\\nLowitja is on the left, taller than Oodgeroo, with her face positioned almost straight towards us and her body angling slightly in towards Oodgeroo.\\n\\nLowitjaâ€™s hair is dark and shiny with a few threads of grey. It is parted at the side, with short soft waves cropped close, framing her face. Her hair stops at her chin, kicking out at the ends. She has gently curving light brows above dark eyes, looking out towards Oodgeroo beyond the right of the photograph. She has a small, rounded nose and her cheeks are bunched up from her smile. Lowitja has a big grin showing the top row of her teeth.\\n\\nShe wears a blouse with a high, ruffled collar that appears white in the image. Below her chin, centred in her collar is a small brooch. The blouse has long puffed sleeves, with the same ruffles on the cuffs as on the collar. Lowitjaâ€™s arms hang relaxed beside her, hands loosely closed. Sheâ€™s wearing a straight skirt, its fabric covered in a dense geometric pattern.\\n\\nOodgeroo stands close to Lowitja on the right. Her face is positioned towards the camera. Her body is angled towards Lowitja. She has short dark hair greying at the temples, curling up and back off her face. Her light-toned eyes look directly towards us through large, slim-framed glasses. Oodgeroo has a small nose. Her cheeks are rounded and slightly dimpled from her wide smile. Her lips are parted revealing the top row of her teeth.\\n\\nOodgeroo is wearing a loose-fitting top that looks white in the black and white photograph. It has a round collar, long sleeves, and a trim of white fringe along the lower edge. The position and gesture of Oodgerooâ€™s arms and hands mimic Lowitjaâ€™s; arms by her sides and fingers gently closed. Beneath her top she has on a straight skirt from a fabric with a slight sheen.\\n\\n**Audio description script written and voiced by Lucinda Shawcross**",

                "transcript": "The portrait is of Anmatyerre woman, Emily Kame Kngwarreye, one of Australiaâ€™s most significant contemporary artists, with her friend Lily. The painting was made by Jenny Sages in 1993, oil on canvas, and measures 2.16m tall by 1.85m wide, including its frame. The frame itself is discrete and simple, made from blond wood, and measuring about 2cm thick. \\n\\nThe portrait depicts Emily, close up, sitting cross legged, grounded on the earth, in the right foreground, and Lily, also sitting, some distance behind Emily, about half way up, and on the left edge of the picture. The focus and detail is on Emily, while Lily and the background landscape are less distinct. The warm orange-browns, yellows and whites, painted in loose, delicate brush strokes, shimmer and shine, capturing the heat of the day. \\n\\nThe background of the painting is flat and sparse, with no defined horizon, only a gentle gradient from lighter tones smudging together at the top, to darker shades in more defined strokes nearer the bottom. \\n\\nLily is shown at the very far left edge of the painting, her right side partially cropped. Her hair is a tangled mass of dark curls framing her round, dark skinned, face. Her face is angled slightly up to her left, as if she is turning towards Emily. Lilyâ€™s eyes seem to be on her friend and a smile plays over her closed lips. Lily wears a t-shirt, coloured in deep green-browns, with dashes of yellow where the light hits it. Her arms are loose with her hands resting, fingers just touching, in her lap. Lily is wearing a blue-green skirt and her bare legs are crossed.\\n\\nOn the ground between Lily and Emily is a pale grey-blue mass of lines which looks like the ashes of a small fire. \\n\\nThe portrait of Emily dominates the painting. Emily faces you directly, her head positioned straight on. Around her head, the brush strokes change from following the horizontal direction of the land in the background of the painting, to following the oval shape of her face, forming a sort of halo in whites and pale yellows. Emilyâ€™s white hair is cropped close to her skull, and her dark skin can be seen through it. Her forehead is high and elaborately furrowed â€“ the furrows having their nexus at, and are most prominent where her brows, eyes, and nose meet. Emilyâ€™s eyes are dark crevices, the irises barely visible, surrounded by wrinkled skin. Her nose is large and smooth, with wide nostrils, and her ears are long and lie flat against her head. Emilyâ€™s cheeks are bunched up and deep lines run beneath them, between her nose and mouth. Emilyâ€™s lips are closed, with the lower slightly fuller than the upper - they are difficult to read, perhaps the glimmer of a smile is passing over them, or they may be set in resignation. Beneath the lips she has a small round chin, around this, her skin is loose and falls into the shadows of her creased neck. \\n\\nWound about Emilyâ€™s neck and tied loosely at her front, is a scarf, painted in fine brush strokes of pale yellows, orange-ochres and greens. Her top too, is made from many colours, - haphazard strokes in orange and yellow are layered and criss-cross each other in rich texture over her broad, rounded, and relaxed shoulders. These warm colours give over to lilac, mint-green, and black brush strokes, weaving together, and defining the volume and contours of her chest. \\n\\nEmilyâ€™s elbows rest comfortably on the thighs of her crossed legs. Her bare forearms are covered in thick veins, her large, wrinkled hands come together at her shins, the left sitting lightly, partially over the right. Light falls on the hands, highlighting their creased skin, emphasising them. Emilyâ€™s skirt covers her crossed legs, and is white, with patches of bright orange-red and the suggestion of a floral pattern in greens and browns. Part of her left foot, in a white shoe, pokes out from under her right knee. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

His paintings often challenge the intersections of Culture, Country, leadership, wealth, power, satire and influence. Namatjira combines political critique with deeply personal histories, which unfold in scenes of vibrant colour and bold brushwork. \\n\\nIn this portrait Vincent represents himself alongside his great-grandfather Albert Namatjira (1902â€“1959) (Western Arrernte/Aranda/Arrarnta), a celebrated artist of layered, detailed and masterful watercolours of Country. Vincent attests to the skill and astute attention Albert embedded in his works, identifying the ways he â€˜was able to capture the unique light and the beauty of his Countryâ€™. _Albert and Vincent_ is a portrait that honours lineage and is a portal across time. By including his great-grandfather alongside his own self portrait, Vincent allows the two artists to converge in time and space â€“ theirs is a shared legacy of family, artistic practice and connection through Country, ever-present and continuous.",

Self-described as a â€˜dreaming of each otherâ€™, the portraits imagine a multiverse where past and present collide, where they are both adults and their younger selves.

                "transcript": "- It was so successful, we just got asked to do lots of things together and we didn't even call ourselves The Huxleys. People would say, \"Oh, the Huxleys are here. Who are these, Huxleys?\" So everything just happened. It wasn't really planned.\\n\\n- When we started making art, no art places took us seriously. We tried to show in galleries to represent us and tried to get the art community behind us and no one was interested. And we were just like, \"We love doing this enough that we're just going to put it out into the world.\" And we kept making things on our own, funding our own projects, doing it because we loved it. And eventually people catch up with you and you know, a lot of people ask us, \"Do you make your own things?\" And we're like, \"Where else would we find these?\" And I think by the fact that you're not trained, or neither of us are trained is a good thing because it allows you to dream bigger. Otherwise you might say, \"That can't be created.\"\\n\\n- You're not confined by any rules and you make things that other people will be like, \"Oh, you can't do that.\" And you just find a way, so you just do it. And I've had fashion designers look at my work and go, \"How did you do this,\" or, \"How do you get into it?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, this way and that way.\" But you just don't have any rules in your head.\\n\\n- Garrett and I decided to make a series of work called \"Postcards from the Edge.\" And these are postcards from the areas and the places that we grew up in. So Garrett is from the Gold Coast and I am from Perth. And we went on this journey where we tried to find and source postcards from the area and the places that exactly places that we were in as children.\\n\\n- Yeah, and by taking yourself back to that time as you are now, I felt the same as, you know, when I was 12 in that situation even though I wasn't you know, painted in green, glitter, and had wigs. I felt like that. And I completely felt like that so it was nice, you know, bringing those two worlds together.\\n\\n- And one thing that we did that was nice with the postcards is this two postcards called \"Small Town Boy: Perth\" and \"Small Town Boy: Gold Coast.\" Where we actually meet and we're joined by a sequin string of heart between us. And it was our idea that wouldn't it been wonderful if we had actually met from those places. And it's a way of us coming together. We did a thing together maybe five years ago, it was called \"People of Letters.\" We wrote letters from the time when we were struggling, growing up in these places to each other, like dreaming of each other. And it was so beautiful because it was just like the idea that you could have someone that would make you feel okay for who you were at that time. Like, if I had met Garrett when I was in school, I think my life would've been a lot easier. And that was something that, yeah.\\n\\n- And it's been nice since we've met each other and being together, we go back to Perth and the Gold Coast. And in a place that you used to get yelled at for being gay, being called poof, or whatever. You know, people are like, \"I like your outfit.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, this is nice.\" You know, things are changing which is really beautiful.\\n\\n- The idea of masking is fascinating to me because it creates this almost anonymous, we could be anyone or anything underneath that mask. And it gives this sense of freedom. For me I love the idea that it takes away, you know, wearing costumes that hide your identity. It takes away gender and it takes away race and class and all these things that were divided and put into binaries. And once you become this creation, it's so freeing and I couldn't get up and perform as well, obviously, it would be terrifying. But when I'm at an amazing costume and makeup and wigs, it creates this diversion that allows me to be the most fantastical escapist version of myself possible. It gives me the confidence.\\n\\n- Yeah, I think wearing the mask came from not wanting to be seen first, so hiding behind the mask. 'Cause I grew up very shy and still am quite shy and introverted. And I find it more interesting to look at as well. I find something like that more interesting. But you develop something in you, you find a power or something that isn't you. It's a freedom, you escape from all these constraints on yourself. So there is something really liberating about performing not as yourself, but as these characters that you've created in a way, but it's still you, you know.\\n\\n- In costume, generally it always interested me. Even like, people, military, or any kind of costume, you're putting on something to go out in the world and do a role and do something that you maybe not when you're at home.\\n\\n- Well, what's interesting, when we make our costumes, we don't know who's going to pop out in a way. And it's just so interesting, like you think, \"Oh my God, I can't believe I'm this frantic character inside this costume. Didn't expect this.\" And yeah, the latest ones we know something's going to happen. We put the latest costumes on and we're like, \"Oh, this is slow.\" You know, there's a slow kind of graceful people that are happening at the moment. It's really exciting.\\n\\n- We call it from page to stage. We love the drawings that we do when we come up with an idea. So basically, I mean neither us are very good drawers. I'm particularly bad, but they're like childlike drawings of either like a photographic scene or a costume. And it's amazing when you take that childlike drawing and then bring it into a reality. I love that transformation. And the costumes often end up looking like me.\\n\\n- They look like, the pictures.\\n\\n- The pictures, but like a heightened glamorous version. I love seeing the contrast between those two things and they're your dream and then the reality made. Yeah, I think that is one of the great thrills for me seeing it when it comes to life. Yeah.\\n\\n- And in between that there's a lot of frustration, tears. And, \"This isn't going to work.\"\\n\\n- Yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot of failures, trial and error, you know.",

Self-described as a â€˜dreaming of each otherâ€™, the portraits imagine a multiverse where past and present collide, where they are both adults and their younger selves.

                "transcript": "- It was so successful, we just got asked to do lots of things together and we didn't even call ourselves The Huxleys. People would say, \"Oh, the Huxleys are here. Who are these, Huxleys?\" So everything just happened. It wasn't really planned.\\n\\n- When we started making art, no art places took us seriously. We tried to show in galleries to represent us and tried to get the art community behind us and no one was interested. And we were just like, \"We love doing this enough that we're just going to put it out into the world.\" And we kept making things on our own, funding our own projects, doing it because we loved it. And eventually people catch up with you and you know, a lot of people ask us, \"Do you make your own things?\" And we're like, \"Where else would we find these?\" And I think by the fact that you're not trained, or neither of us are trained is a good thing because it allows you to dream bigger. Otherwise you might say, \"That can't be created.\"\\n\\n- You're not confined by any rules and you make things that other people will be like, \"Oh, you can't do that.\" And you just find a way, so you just do it. And I've had fashion designers look at my work and go, \"How did you do this,\" or, \"How do you get into it?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, this way and that way.\" But you just don't have any rules in your head.\\n\\n- Garrett and I decided to make a series of work called \"Postcards from the Edge.\" And these are postcards from the areas and the places that we grew up in. So Garrett is from the Gold Coast and I am from Perth. And we went on this journey where we tried to find and source postcards from the area and the places that exactly places that we were in as children.\\n\\n- Yeah, and by taking yourself back to that time as you are now, I felt the same as, you know, when I was 12 in that situation even though I wasn't you know, painted in green, glitter, and had wigs. I felt like that. And I completely felt like that so it was nice, you know, bringing those two worlds together.\\n\\n- And one thing that we did that was nice with the postcards is this two postcards called \"Small Town Boy: Perth\" and \"Small Town Boy: Gold Coast.\" Where we actually meet and we're joined by a sequin string of heart between us. And it was our idea that wouldn't it been wonderful if we had actually met from those places. And it's a way of us coming together. We did a thing together maybe five years ago, it was called \"People of Letters.\" We wrote letters from the time when we were struggling, growing up in these places to each other, like dreaming of each other. And it was so beautiful because it was just like the idea that you could have someone that would make you feel okay for who you were at that time. Like, if I had met Garrett when I was in school, I think my life would've been a lot easier. And that was something that, yeah.\\n\\n- And it's been nice since we've met each other and being together, we go back to Perth and the Gold Coast. And in a place that you used to get yelled at for being gay, being called poof, or whatever. You know, people are like, \"I like your outfit.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, this is nice.\" You know, things are changing which is really beautiful.\\n\\n- The idea of masking is fascinating to me because it creates this almost anonymous, we could be anyone or anything underneath that mask. And it gives this sense of freedom. For me I love the idea that it takes away, you know, wearing costumes that hide your identity. It takes away gender and it takes away race and class and all these things that were divided and put into binaries. And once you become this creation, it's so freeing and I couldn't get up and perform as well, obviously, it would be terrifying. But when I'm at an amazing costume and makeup and wigs, it creates this diversion that allows me to be the most fantastical escapist version of myself possible. It gives me the confidence.\\n\\n- Yeah, I think wearing the mask came from not wanting to be seen first, so hiding behind the mask. 'Cause I grew up very shy and still am quite shy and introverted. And I find it more interesting to look at as well. I find something like that more interesting. But you develop something in you, you find a power or something that isn't you. It's a freedom, you escape from all these constraints on yourself. So there is something really liberating about performing not as yourself, but as these characters that you've created in a way, but it's still you, you know.\\n\\n- In costume, generally it always interested me. Even like, people, military, or any kind of costume, you're putting on something to go out in the world and do a role and do something that you maybe not when you're at home.\\n\\n- Well, what's interesting, when we make our costumes, we don't know who's going to pop out in a way. And it's just so interesting, like you think, \"Oh my God, I can't believe I'm this frantic character inside this costume. Didn't expect this.\" And yeah, the latest ones we know something's going to happen. We put the latest costumes on and we're like, \"Oh, this is slow.\" You know, there's a slow kind of graceful people that are happening at the moment. It's really exciting.\\n\\n- We call it from page to stage. We love the drawings that we do when we come up with an idea. So basically, I mean neither us are very good drawers. I'm particularly bad, but they're like childlike drawings of either like a photographic scene or a costume. And it's amazing when you take that childlike drawing and then bring it into a reality. I love that transformation. And the costumes often end up looking like me.\\n\\n- They look like, the pictures.\\n\\n- The pictures, but like a heightened glamorous version. I love seeing the contrast between those two things and they're your dream and then the reality made. Yeah, I think that is one of the great thrills for me seeing it when it comes to life. Yeah.\\n\\n- And in between that there's a lot of frustration, tears. And, \"This isn't going to work.\"\\n\\n- Yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot of failures, trial and error, you know.",

created.\"\\n\\n24\\n00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.250\\n<v ->You're not confined by any rules and you make things</v>\\n\\n25\\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.620\\nthat other people will be like, \"Oh, you can't do that.\"\\n\\n26\\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.140\\nAnd you just find a way, so you just do it.\\n\\n27\\n00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.877\\nAnd I've had fashion designers look at my work and go,\\n\\n28\\n00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:21.020\\n\"How did you do this,\" or, \"How do you get into it?\"\\n\\n29\\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.530\\nAnd I'm like, \"Oh, this way and that way.\"\\n\\n30\\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.093\\nBut you just don't have any rules in your head.\\n\\n31\\n00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:31.870\\n(gentle upbeat music)\\n\\n32\\n00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.080\\n<v ->Garrett and I decided to make a series of work</v>\\n\\n33\\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.080\\ncalled \"Postcards from the Edge.\"\\n\\n34\\n00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.480\\nAnd these are postcards from the areas and the places\\n\\n35\\n00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.620\\nthat we grew up in.\\n\\n36\\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.910\\nSo Garrett is from the Gold Coast and I am from Perth.\\n\\n37\\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.550\\nAnd we went on this journey where we tried to find\\n\\n38\\n00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.840\\nand source postcards from the area and the places\\n\\n39\\n00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.580\\nthat exactly places that we were in as children.\\n\\n40\\n00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.790\\n<v ->Yeah, and by taking yourself back to that time</v>\\n\\n41\\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.360\\nas you are now, I felt the same as, you know,\\n\\n42\\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.490\\nwhen I was 12 in that situation even though I wasn't\\n\\n43\\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.930\\nyou know, painted in green, glitter, and had wigs.\\n\\n44\\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.247\\nI felt like that.\\n\\n45\\n00:02:06.247 --> 00:02:10.600\\nAnd I completely felt like that so it was nice, you know,\\n\\n46\\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.030\\nbringing those two worlds together.\\n\\n47\\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.880\\n<v ->And one thing that we did that was nice with the postcards</v>\\n\\n48\\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.220\\nis this two postcards called \"Small Town Boy: Perth\"\\n\\n49\\n00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.080\\nand \"Small Town Boy: Gold Coast.\"\\n\\n50\\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.630\\nWhere we actually meet and we're joined\\n\\n51\\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.750\\nby a sequin string of heart between us.\\n\\n52\\n00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.580\\nAnd it was our idea that wouldn't it been wonderful\\n\\n53\\n00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.260\\nif we had actually met from those places.\\n\\n54\\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.743\\nAnd it's a way of us coming together.\\n\\n55\\n00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.840\\nWe did a thing together maybe five years ago,\\n\\n56\\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.310\\nit was called \"People of Letters.\"\\n\\n57\\n00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.210\\nWe wrote letters from the time when we were struggling,\\n\\n58\\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.370\\ngrowing up in these places to each other,\\n\\n59\\n00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.060\\nlike dreaming of each other.\\n\\n60\\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.040\\nAnd it was so beautiful because it was just like the idea\\n\\n61\\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.047\\nthat you could have someone that would make you feel okay\\n\\n62\\n00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:02.653\\nfor who you were at that time.\\n\\n63\\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.590\\nLike, if I had met Garrett when I was in school,\\n\\n64\\n00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.290\\nI think my life would've been a lot easier.\\n\\n65\\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.900\\nAnd that was something that, yeah.\\n\\n66\\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.660\\n<v ->And it's been nice since we've met each other</v>\\n\\n67\\n00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.780\\nand being together, we go back to Perth and the Gold Coast.\\n\\n68\\n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.050\\nAnd in a place that you used to get yelled at for being gay,\\n\\n69\\n00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.200\\nbeing called poof, or whatever.\\n\\n70\\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.490\\nYou know, people are like, \"I like your outfit.\"\\n\\n71\\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.060\\nAnd I'm like, \"Okay, this is nice.\"\\n\\n72\\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.860\\nYou know, things are changing which is really beautiful.\\n\\n73\\n00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:35.310\\n(bright upbeat music)\\n\\n74\\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.700\\n<v ->The idea of masking is fascinating to me</v>\\n\\n75\\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.530\\nbecause it creates this almost anonymous,\\n\\n76\\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.240\\nwe could be anyone or anything underneath that mask.\\n\\n77\\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.210\\nAnd it gives this sense of freedom.\\n\\n78\\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.570\\nFor me I love the idea that it takes away, you know,\\n\\n79\\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.180\\nwearing costumes that hide your identity.\\n\\n80\\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.910\\nIt takes away gender and it takes away race and class\\n\\n81\\n00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.570\\nand all these things that were divided\\n\\n82\\n00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.400\\nand put into binaries.\\n\\n83\\n00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.330\\nAnd once you become this creation, it's so freeing\\n\\n84\\n00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.670\\nand I couldn't get up and perform as well, obviously,\\n\\n85\\n00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.280\\nit would be terrifying.\\n\\n86\\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.280\\nBut when I'm at an amazing costume and makeup and wigs,\\n\\n87\\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.460\\nit creates this diversion that allows me\\n\\n88\\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.230\\nto be the most fantastical escapist version\\n\\n89\\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.050\\nof myself possible.\\n\\n90\\n00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.284\\nIt gives me the confidence.\\n\\n91\\n00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:29.290\\n<v ->Yeah, I think wearing the mask came from not wanting</v>\\n\\n92\\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.160\\nto be seen first, so hiding behind the mask.\\n\\n93\\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.990\\n'Cause I grew up very shy and still am\\n\\n94\\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.440\\nquite shy and introverted.\\n\\n95\\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.460\\nAnd I find it more interesting to look at as well.\\n\\n96\\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.940\\nI find something like that more interesting.\\n\\n97\\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.530\\nBut you develop something in you, you find a power\\n\\n98\\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.300\\nor something that isn't you.\\n\\n99\\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.870\\nIt's a freedom, you escape from all these constraints\\n\\n100\\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.150\\non yourself.\\n\\n101\\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.490\\nSo there is something really liberating about performing\\n\\n102\\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.110\\nnot as yourself, but as these characters that you've created\\n\\n103\\n00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.267\\nin a way, but it's still you, you know. (laughs)\\n\\n104\\n00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:07.413\\n<v ->In costume, generally it always interested me.</v>\\n\\n105\\n00:05:07.413 --> 00:05:11.520\\nEven like, people, military, or any kind of costume,\\n\\n106\\n00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.936\\nyou're putting on something to go out in the world\\n\\n107\\n00:05:13.936 --> 00:05:18.060\\nand do a role and do something that you maybe not\\n\\n108\\n00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.470\\nwhen you're at home.\\n\\n109\\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.780\\n<v ->Well, what's interesting, when we make our costumes,</v>\\n\\n110\\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.300\\nwe don't know who's going to pop out in a way.\\n\\n111\\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.660\\nAnd it's just so interesting, like you think, \"Oh my God,\\n\\n112\\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.060\\nI can't believe I'm this frantic character inside\\n\\n113\\n00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.980\\nthis costume.\\n\\n114\\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.410\\nDidn't expect this.\"\\n\\n115\\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.810\\nAnd yeah, the latest ones we know something's\\n\\n116\\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.643\\ngoing to happen.\\n\\n117\\n00:05:35.643 --> 00:05:38.057\\nWe put the latest costumes on and we're like,\\n\\n118\\n00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:39.454\\n\"Oh, this is slow.\"\\n\\n119\\n00:05:39.454 --> 00:05:42.140\\nYou know, there's a slow kind of graceful people\\n\\n120\\n00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.718\\nthat are happening at the moment.\\n\\n121\\n00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.230\\nIt's really exciting.\\n\\n122\\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.019\\n<v ->We call it from page to stage.</v>\\n\\n123\\n00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.852\\n(Garrett laughs)\\n\\n124\\n00:05:49.852 --> 00:05:54.100\\nWe love the drawings that we do when we come up\\n\\n125\\n00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.310\\nwith an idea.\\n\\n126\\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.120\\nSo basically, I mean neither us are very good drawers.\\n\\n127\\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.380\\nI'm particularly bad, but they're like childlike drawings\\n\\n128\\n00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.290\\nof either like a photographic scene or a costume.\\n\\n129\\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.290\\nAnd it's amazing when you take that childlike drawing\\n\\n130\\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.283\\nand then bring it into a reality.\\n\\n131\\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.700\\nI love that transformation.\\n\\n132\\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.680\\nAnd the costumes often end up looking like me.\\n\\n133\\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.065\\n<v ->They look like, the pictures.</v>\\n\\n134\\n00:06:22.065 --> 00:06:24.230\\n<v ->(laughs) The pictures, but like</v>\\n\\n135\\n00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.857\\na heightened glamorous version.\\n\\n136\\n00:06:25.857 --> 00:06:28.200\\n(Garrett laughs)\\n\\n137\\n00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.460\\nI love seeing the contrast between those two things\\n\\n138\\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.473\\nand they're your dream and then the reality made.\\n\\n139\\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.529\\nYeah, I think that is one of the great thrills for me\\n\\n140\\n00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.373\\nseeing it when it comes to life.\\n\\n141\\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.663\\nYeah.\\n\\n142\\n00:06:43.663 --> 00:06:46.020\\n<v ->And in between that there's a lot of frustration, tears.</v>\\n\\n143\\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.200\\nAnd, \"This isn't going to work.\"\\n\\n144\\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.033\\n<v ->Yeah, there's a lot.</v>\\n\\n145\\n00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:51.333\\nThere's a lot of failures, trial and error, you know.\\n\\n146\\n00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:54.212\\n(both laughs)\\n\\n147\\n00:06:54.212 --> 00:06:57.379 line:15% \\n(gentle bright music)\\n\\n148\\n00:07:13.573 --> 00:07:16.323\\n(car doors thud)\\n\\n",

Croftâ€™s tintype photographs enlist a 19th-century photographic technique to reclaim ownership over representation. Often photographing extraordinary people within her network, Croft invites the subject to stare directly into the camera, and in turn meet the viewerâ€™s gaze. This eye contact is an act of empowerment and self-determination by the subject that becomes a form of encounter, pulling the viewer into the image. \\n\\nThis photograph is a tender self portrait of artist and child that bears witness to the closeness between the pair. Across generations the two care for one another with respect for the bloodlines of inherited lineage. Christopher embraces Brenda in a moment of connection. Creating a link with his arms that hold her in an infinite loop, the two are bonded as one in body and spirit. Speaking of her relationship with Christopher, Croft says: â€˜It is a gift to share Christopherâ€™s life and I learn from him every day â€“ blood/memory. Marntaj.â€™",

Burney was the first First Nations person to be admitted to New South Wales Parliament and the first First Nations woman to serve in the House of Representatives. Burney is resolute in her commitment to the prevention of domestic violence and family violence. \\n\\nBurney and Riley were close friends, and he lived with Burney in Leichardt when Binni was young. Rileyâ€™s tender portrait shows the bond between mother and child. As Burney later recalled: â€˜Looking at those pictures has taken me back to the early 80s when we were all so young, and really had no sense of the enormous lives that some of us would have â€¦ Michael had an enormous influence on both my children. He was their uncle, and a connection between Michael and my children is very strong, so itâ€™s a very, very special photograph. And I remember Michael getting us to pose for that photograph. And I had no idea that it would become such an enduring image of the beauty that he could make.â€™",

It is a black and white photograph taken in 1984 and printed in 2013. An inkjet print on paper, it measures 43.1 centimetres high and 54 centimetres wide.  \\nLinda is educator, activist and politician Linda Burney, a Wiradjuri woman, with her young son Binni. It is an intimate head and shoulders portrait of a young mother holding her baby against her body. Binni nestles into his motherâ€™s left shoulder as she faces forward. Binniâ€™s back is to us as Linda supports his neck and head with her slender left hand.\\n\\nGentle diffused light washes over the portrait from her left casting the right-hand side of Lindaâ€™s head and face into deep shadow. The contrast of light and shade emphasizes the physical connection between mother and baby.\\n\\nLinda has a downward tilt to her head. She has short, slightly wavy, thick dark hair with a right-hand part. She has fine dark eyebrows over downcast eyes with shadowed lids and long lashes. She has faint lines either side of her nose and her lips are slightly upturned with a hint of a smile.\\n\\nLindaâ€™s chin rests against Binniâ€™s left shoulder and his dimpled bent left elbow peaks beneath her chin. Lindaâ€™s right shoulder fades into the dark background.  \\nThere is a sense of stillness and calm. \\n\\n**Audio description script written and vocied by Krysia Kitch**",

You know, it was a very different place for Aboriginal people in the 80s, but it was also a time when things were really starting to happen. I think what those photographs really demonstrate to me is a radical re-look at the way that Aboriginal people were being represented.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>I also look at every individual in the series â€“ all of them that I know, some of them that I am still very much in contact with â€“ and just think there was an alignment of the stars to bring us all together.</span>\\n\\n<span>Michael had an enormous influence on both my children. He was their uncle, and a connection between Michael and my children is very strong, so it's a very, very special photograph. And I remember Michael getting us to pose for that photograph. And I had no idea that it would become such an enduring image of the beauty that he could make.</span>\\n\\n<span>Brenda Croft:</span>\\n\\n<span>The image that day that he did with me and Dad... I can still remember that Dad's shirt had a big coffee stain on it, where he'd tipped his coffee on him. It didn't take very long. He just came in, took photographs. And I just, I love that image. You know, we used to go along to all the exhibitions that were on, around the traps. And Dad was there because he was friends with Ace, and Dad's, not bragging, but he was just really proud. And he was going 'Oh, you know, you've got to come to Michael's opening tomorrow night because you'll see an image ofÂ me and Brenda in it. Then Dad sort of wanders off somewhere and Michael's [under his breath] \"Brenda, Brenda, come 'ere, come 'ere\" and I went over and said \"What, what\" and he said 'I haven't printed it. What'll I do?\" And I just said, you know, \"Well if you want to make an old man happy, you'd better print it. So we did. We spent the entire night printing it in Sandy Edwards' studio, printing it by hand. So we framed it and and â€“ lucky for him â€“ Dad bought it at the opening.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>Darrell Sibosado:</span>\\n\\n<span>I actually love that image. For me, personally, it's one of the best photos I've seen of myself. It's the image that reflects me from that time, makes me think about it, you know, who I was at that time.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>So that day, I remember it was a bit organised. I kept saying yesterday I remember how disorganised Michael seemed. But this was a bit of a plan. But anyway, it was on the first floor, and we were in there, and it was quite simple. There was just him with a camera. He was so comfortable to be around. You know, even though he was quiet and everything, you knew it was a good quiet. It wasn't a quiet where he's thinking you're an idiot or anything like that. You know he's not thinking bad thoughts. And I just trusted him to do whatever he wants. So I just sat there and he took the photo and that's what came out.</span>",

The series presents a glimpse of the Sudanese-Australian model and her family at home in Adelaide. Adut was born in South Sudan and spent the first several years of her life in the UNâ€™s Kakuma refugee camp in north-west Kenya after her family fled from civil war. They later came to Australia and settled in Adelaide in 2008. Adutâ€™s break-out modelling assignment came at the age of 16, when she walked the runway for Yves Saint Laurent at Paris Fashion Week 2016. In 2017, she became only the second woman of colour to model bridal gowns for Chanel. The following year she featured in the Pirelli calendar and made 33 appearances at Paris Fashion Week. Adut was selected by the Duchess of Sussex to feature in British _Vogueâ€™s_ â€˜Forces for Changeâ€™ edition in 2019, which profiled her activism on humanitarian issues, notably the rights of asylum seekers, and racial and gender equality.",

Trukanini was the daughter of Mangana of the Leillateah (Recherche Bay) people. Speaking the many dialects of his peoples, Wurati is remembered as a storyteller and watercraft expert. He held specialised knowledge of building vessels designed for travels across the saltwater Country surrounding the lands of Lunawanna-alonnah (Bruny Island). \\n\\nTrukanini and Wurati experienced the Black War conflicts from 1824, eventually working with invaders as a strategy for survival. They both navigated the conflicts between the colonial government and their peoples, while maintaining responsibility and pride in their culture. Wurati, for example, refused to eat foreign foods or wear colonial garments. Trukanini refuted expectations of assimilation, proudly wearing her maireener shell necklace as a marker of womenâ€™s culture, the push and pull of the saltwater tide, and as a means of connection to the ocean ecosystems. \\n\\nWurati sat for sculptor Benjamin Law in 1835 and the resulting bust, and the bust of Trukanini completed in 1836, have been identified as the earliest known sculptures of Australian subjects created by a British colonist. These works, which were produced in multiple iterations to disseminate across the world, testify to the way representations of First Nations people have been exploited and betrayed as part of the colonial project. And yet these proud leaders endure, asserting their identity and defiance.",

Approx 60 cm high, 40 cm wide and 25 cm deep, Trucaninnyâ€™s bust depicts her head and torso and ends, cropped at her upper arm. The bust is painted jet black, which has a low sheen and is mounted on a cast plaster stand, or socle, which is also black. The simple squat cylindrical stand has a curvaceous form â€“ rounded collar, narrower stem and wider base. \\n\\nHer hair is short with tight curls. Her head is tilted slightly downwards. Her solemn face is broad with strong features. She has a short forehead, strong brow and deep-set eyes. Her gaze is intense. Her prominent cheekbones, either side of her broad nose, give her cheeks a rounded appearance in contrast to the deep-set eyes. She has a full mouth, with an emphasis on the cleft running between her nose and upper lip. She holds her mouth closed, and this, together with her fixed gaze, gives Trucaninny a quiet fortitude. Her square chin is asymmetrical, with an indent slightly left-of-centre. \\n\\nAround her neck, Trucaninny wears a necklace of tiny conical maireener shells laced together. The necklace lies flat against her skin with the narrow ends of the shells pointing outwards. The long strand is wound around her neck twice, resting on her collarbone and lower in the centre of her chest. \\n\\nTrucaninnyâ€™s shoulders are rolled forwards slightly, matching the downward tilt of her head and the direction of her gaze. From her right shoulder, draped low across her chest and under her left arm she wears an animal skin. The skin, irregular in shape, is twisted around itself, gaping to reveal her right breast and nipple. The drapes and folds show both sides of the animal skin â€“ the thick furred texture in contrast with the smooth underside. A triangle of fur hangs long over her right breast and past the end of the bust.",

Trukanini was the daughter of Mangana of the Leillateah (Recherche Bay) people. Speaking the many dialects of his peoples, Wurati is remembered as a storyteller and watercraft expert. He held specialised knowledge of building vessels designed for travels across the saltwater Country surrounding the lands of Lunawanna-alonnah (Bruny Island). \\n\\nTrukanini and Wurati experienced the Black War conflicts from 1824, eventually working with invaders as a strategy for survival. They both navigated the conflicts between the colonial government and their peoples, while maintaining responsibility and pride in their culture. Wurati, for example, refused to eat foreign foods or wear colonial garments. Trukanini refuted expectations of assimilation, proudly wearing her maireener shell necklace as a marker of womenâ€™s culture, the push and pull of the saltwater tide, and as a means of connection to the ocean ecosystems. \\n\\nWurati sat for sculptor Benjamin Law in 1835 and the resulting bust, and the bust of Trukanini completed in 1836, have been identified as the earliest known sculptures of Australian subjects created by a British colonist. These works, which were produced in multiple iterations to disseminate across the world, testify to the way representations of First Nations people have been exploited and betrayed as part of the colonial project. And yet these proud leaders endure, asserting their identity and defiance.",

Known for his 'legitimate head tones and skilfully managed falsetto notes', Squires appeared in over 1300 performances during his eight year stay, the majority of which he performed in leading roles with his future wife, prima donna di forza, Lucy Escott. Born in 1825 in Bennington, Vermont, Squires trained as a professional singer under the instruction of church organist and early in his career appeared in New York with divas such as the 'Swedish Nightingale', Jenny Lind, and renowned soprano, Lucy Escott. In 1852, he went on to perform in Italy, becoming known as the 'first American singer to have achieved a career on an Italian stage' and later sang with J. H Tully's National English Opera company. Arriving in Australia in 1861, he debuted alongside Escott Lucia di Lammermoor at the Theatre Royal in Melbourne. Lyster's company proved popular with audiences, performing six nights a week with a repertoire of operas in Italian, German and English. Possessing 'handsome stage presence and a beautiful bel canto voice', Squires was an immediate favourite with Melbourne audiences and, along with Escott, was said to have rivalled Nellie Melba in making opera a form of mass entertainment in Australia. Though audiences called for Squires to 'infuse more animation into his acting', he possessed a 'beautiful mezza voce' and was considered as 'great a draw as the prima donna'. After nearly twenty years of working together, Squires and Escott married in May 1870 and retired to Paris. Squires returned to the USA following Escott's death and died in Iowa in January 1907.\\n\\nEdwin Dalton (active 1853â€“1865), artist and photographer, arrived in Victoria in the early 1850s having exhibited on occasion with the Royal Academy since 1818. In London, he had trained and worked with painter Sir William Ross, whose artistâ€“sister Magdalena Dalton married. In Melbourne, he established himself as a portrait painter, exhibiting with the Victoria Fine Arts' Society in 1853 and in the Melbourne Exhibition in 1854. He added photography to his repertoire after moving to Sydney where, in 1858, he opened his 'Royal Photographic Establishment' at 400 George Street. By 1861 he was offering 'photographic portraiture in all the modern branches â€“ crayon, ivory, glass and paper â€“ artistically coloured by E. Dalton, formerly painter and instructor to the Queen'. Daltonâ€™s cartes de visite of Henry Squires and Lucy Escott were among the many portraits of local and international personages advertised as being available from Sydney stationer J.R. Clarke in December 1862 for two shillings each (or 21 shillings per dozen). This delicately hand-coloured carte of Squires and the corresponding image of Escott were originally contained in Squires' personal carte de visite album.",

Born in Lancashire and raised in Manchester, Mort emigrated to New South Wales in 1838, believing that the colony presented â€˜a better opening for his industrious habits and his business abilities than there was in the land of his birthâ€™. Within five years he had started his own business as an auctioneer of wool and other commodities â€“ a profession for which his â€˜suavity of demeanour, and imperturbable good temper, rendered him eminently fitâ€™. By 1850, he was the premier auctioneer in Sydney and had interests in insurance, agriculture, railway and mining ventures, among others. But he is perhaps most remembered for other initiatives, such as the dairy farms he operated on the estate he acquired at Bodalla in 1860; and the dry dock he helped to establish at Balmain in 1855, which he progressed from shipbuilding to locomotive production and general engineering. He also funded experiments in freezing and refrigeration technology, forming the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company in 1875. Mort donated some of his substantial wealth to community causes, contributing to the building of Sydneyâ€™s St Andrewâ€™s Cathedral and the Universityâ€™s St Paulâ€™s College. Following his death in May 1878, the city marked its esteem for him with a statue in Macquarie Place and Balmainâ€™s Mort Bay was named in his honour.\\n\\nTheresa Shepheard Mort (nÃ©e Laidley, 1820â€“1869) was eight years old when she came to Sydney, her father, James Laidley (1786â€“1835) having been appointed to the position of deputy commissary general. The eldest of eight children, she was educated at home and received art lessons from Conrad Martens and the ex-convict portraitist, Charles Rodius. Theresa was around twenty-one when she married Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, and twenty-three when her first child, James Laidley Mort, was born. Theresa had eight more children over the next seventeen years; seven of them survived to adulthood. She spent much of her married life at Greenoaks, the Darling Point home established by Mort in 1843. Theresa has been described as a devoted wife and mother and Thomas was devastated by her death from cancer at the age of forty-nine. Mort, however, later remarried, and was to have two more sons before he died.",

Daguerreotype photograph mounted in a copper coloured frame inside a protective case, measuring 8 cm in height and 7 cm wide. \\n\\nThis photograph has a mirror-like finish, the image is a range of grey shades. At certain angles the image disappears turning into a solid silver background. On moving, the image reveals itself again. Theresa is seated on the left, with Thomas on the right, against a blank wall with a square wooden table placed between them. An upturned top hat and a book are positioned on the table. \\n\\nTheresa has a severe middle part in her hair. Coiled ringlets frame her face and brush against her shoulders. She has an oval-shaped face with a serious expression, with lowered eyebrows over almond-shaped eyes, a broad nose and full closed lips. Her left arm leans upon the table, fingers curled over to rest against her chin. She wears a lace-collared, long velvet cloak over a full-length long-sleeved dress, with a silk-like sheen, which ends in a deep ruffle. A straw bonnet decorated with velvet bands and a bow lies on her lap. \\n\\nThomas has luscious thick wavy hair, swept over in a right-side part and curling around his ears. He also has a serious expression, deep set and heavy-lidded eyes set over a large straight nose and unsmiling lips. His right forearm rests on the book placed on the table, fingers hanging off the edge, with a ring on his little finger. His left arm rests against his thigh. He wears a high-collared shirt with necktie. A dark double-breasted jacket is buttoned closed, ending mid-thigh. Light trousers cover his legs. His right leg is bent at the knee with his left stretching out in a more relaxed pose. \\n\\nThere are some marks on the surface of the photograph particularly on the bottom edge, slightly distorting the image.",

John was 17 when he first went to prison and Thomas was purported to have ridden with the infamous Ben Hall. In October 1865, Thomas escaped from gaol while awaiting trial for armed robbery; thereafter, aided by various mates, he embarked on a string of depredations around Braidwood, Araluen and further south. In April 1866, at Nerrigundah, the gang engaged in a hold-up that left a policeman dead. Thomas was outlawed in May, by which time John had joined him. Reports described them as â€˜well-mounted, and armed to the teethâ€™. In September 1866 colonial secretary Henry Parkes sent four special constables to Braidwood â€˜for the express purpose of hunting down the desperate maraudersâ€™. In January 1867, the four were murdered in an ambush at Jinden. The Clarkes were blamed immediately and the authorities offered rewards of Â£1000 each, alive or dead. Aided by an effective bush telegraph system, the brothers evaded capture until April 1867, when they were tracked to a hideout near Araluen, apprehended, and taken to Braidwood Gaol. There, an as yet unidentified photographer took portraits that were sold by a Goulburn bookseller for two shillings and sixpence each. The brothers were later tried in Sydney before Sir Alfred Stephen, who in sentencing them to death noted the more than 60 offences, excluding murders, of which they were suspected.",

Born in Hobart, Rosina and her sister Fannie (1850â€“1904) began their singing training early, their fatherâ€™s straitened circumstances and their motherâ€™s dominance and ambition determining that they would have careers on the musical stage. The sisters performed alongside their mother in the 1860s as the â€˜Carandini Family Troupeâ€™, touring widely and earning the warm approbation of audiences. One report of a performance in Bendigo in 1869 noted the â€˜power, sweetness, and purityâ€™ of Fannieâ€™s voice and stated that the sisters â€˜were very successful in a number of duetsâ€™. Their rendition of â€˜Beware! Beware! I trust her notâ€™, according to the report, â€˜proved very laughter provoking, and had to be repeated in answer to an enthusiastic encoreâ€™. Rosina also performed as a principal soloist on several occasions, winning much respect and admiration. When Prince Alfred visited Melbourne in 1868 he was so impressed with Rosina that he promised to make it possible for her to study in Europe. The opportunity, however, was one of many that she declined so as not to transgress notions of acceptable behaviour for married women. She later worked as a music teacher and on her death in 1932 was remembered as the leading Australian soprano of her era. \\n\\nPhotographer Charles Hewitt was working in Melbourne by 1860 and was one of the founding members of the Photographic Society of Victoria. Initially he was in business with Charles Nettleton, but by 1866, when examples of his work were included in the Melbourne Intercolonial Exhibition, he was working independently. He occupied a studio at 95 Swanston Street from 1867, in which year the â€˜Misses Carandiniâ€™ performed in Melbourne several times, including in the â€˜Charitable Music Festivalâ€™ at the Exhibition Building in April. Hewittâ€™s portraits of the sisters would in all likelihood have been created to coincide with one such performance. Rosina is depicted in a day dress with deepened waistline, full-length sleeves and high neckline, while Fannie wears an off-the-shoulder, bell-shaped dress, more suited to evening attire. Their full skirts are worn over a cage crinoline with a boned corset tightened over a chemise in typical mid-nineteenth century fashion. They wear their hair with a central part and swept back from the face to form a chignon. Both are adorned with braided hair chains, worn with sisterly sentiment, complimenting the lace trimmings on their frocks, decorative belts and ornamented surrounds.",

An expression of queer joy, the work is both performative and candid, and, as in so much of Yangâ€™s work, its power can be found in its directness. This is both a staged moment and a quiet everyday one.",

And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. That's been my philosophy. I never consciously came out as a gay man, I was swept out by events at the time. And that was exactly what happened to me in the 70s. I was in the closet when I was in Brisbane, I came to Sydney in 1969. People were starting to come out in the early 70s, and suddenly there was this whole connection of gay people with each other, and it was really quite exciting. I also then became a photographer in Sydney as well.\\n\\nGenerally, my style of photography is I'm just photographing what's around me in my everyday life. At the time, I was living at Martin Sharp's mansion in Bellevue Hill and Peter Allen came to visit him. Peter was in town and he'd heard that this was a place that he should visit. He'd never met Martin before. And so he just came, to visit. I'd met Peter a few times before, just around the traps. I wouldn't say I got to know him well, but well enough to get that snap of him. So I was brushing shoulders with celebrities at that time. And I met Mel Gibson at one of the parties. And he asked me if I'd take a photograph of him because he needed a card. His parents, they used to answer all his fan mail and they needed a card to say \"best wishes from Mel\" or something, and answer their question. So he got me to do it. And so that's how I took those photographs of Mel. Patrick White never wanted to be interviewed, he never wanted to be photographed. But in this particular case, with the portrait that's in the gallery, Brett Whitely wanted to paint his portrait, I think for the Archibald. And Brett asked me, if I could photograph him so he could get a set of photographs of him. There was a rumour going around that I was the only person who Patrick would allow to photograph him, which wasn't true. But anyway, I never ever quashed the rumour, 'cuz it was all to my advantage. And so I took a very good set of photographs for Brett, and they were taken at Kate Fitzpatrick's place in Kings Cross, where she had a lunch to introduce Patrick to Brett.\\n\\nProbably the 80s was my most productive time and all those photographs came out, because I was brushing shoulders with celebrities. But after that period, say at the end of the 80s, I started to do self-portraits. I suppose it's was the evolution of my own story when I kind of claim my own story. And the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields, in the place where my uncle had been shot, William Fang Yuen, had been shot and I'd located that in my research of the event and I found the place. So I stood there in the cane fields and I somehow knew that this was an important event, because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event, which happened 72 years ago. But here I was, kind of retelling the story. And that was a very important thing, moment in my life. So I did that. One of the first ones in this cluster that I've got is called \"Self Portrait #2\" it came after the one of standing in the cane fields. But when I was about six years old, I'll tell you this story because almost in every interview I've ever done I've always told this story. It's become as John McDonald, the critic said, \"It's become my incantation.\"\\n\\nWhen I was six years old, one of the kids at school called me \"Ching Chong Chinaman, born in a jar, christened in a teapot. Ha, ha, ha.\" I had no idea what he was talking about, although I knew from his expression he was being horrible to me. So I went home to my mother and I said to her, \"Mom, I'm not Chinese, am I?\" And she said, \"Yes, you are.\" Her tone was hard, and it shocked me. And I knew in that moment, that being Chinese was like a terrible curse. And I could not rely on my mother for help. Or my brother, who was four years older than me, very much more experienced in the world. He chimed in, \"And you'd better get used to it.\" I claim my heritage in the 80s, because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged. I'm very happy that that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so, I feel that I'm living my art as well as my life. And so that's very satisfying for me.\\n\\nThen I'd done performance pieces, telling the personal story and realising that many of the images had stories. I realised that the handwriting makes my work more unique - my very handwriting. And so I've chosen more recently photographs that have got a story, which I can write on. And so that's usually a bit of a preference for me when choosing a photograph.",

Ha, ha, ha.\"\\n\\n87\\n00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.880\\nI had no idea what he was talking about, although I knew\\n\\n88\\n00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.480\\nfrom his expression he was being horrible to me.\\n\\n89\\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.027\\nSo I went home to my mother and I said to her,\\n\\n90\\n00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:43.290\\n\"Mom, I'm not Chinese, am I?\"\\n\\n91\\n00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.767\\nAnd she said, \"Yes, you are.\"\\n\\n92\\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.210\\nHer tone was hard, and it shocked me.\\n\\n93\\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.910\\nAnd I knew in that moment, that being Chinese was\\n\\n94\\n00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.340\\nlike a terrible curse.\\n\\n95\\n00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.700\\nAnd I could not rely on my mother for help.\\n\\n96\\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.420\\nOr my brother, who was four years older than me,\\n\\n97\\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.630\\nvery much more experienced in the world.\\n\\n98\\n00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.167\\nhe chimed in, \"And you'd better get used to it.\"\\n\\n99\\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.230\\nI claim my heritage in the 80s, because the Chinese part\\n\\n100\\n00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.713\\nof me was always denied and unacknowledged.\\n\\n101\\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.960\\nI'm very happy that that has happened because\\n\\n102\\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.520\\nmy life and my art have kind of joined together.\\n\\n103\\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.520\\nAnd so, I feel that I'm living my art as well as my life.\\n\\n104\\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.413\\nAnd so that's very satisfying for me.\\n\\n105\\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.720\\nThen I'd done performance pieces, telling the personal story\\n\\n106\\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.653\\nand realising that many of the images had stories.\\n\\n107\\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.670\\nI realised that the handwriting makes\\n\\n108\\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.160\\nmy work more unique.\\n\\n109\\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.310\\n- my very handwriting.\\n\\n110\\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.190\\nAnd so I've chosen more recently\\n\\n111\\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.430\\nphotographs that have got a story, which I can write on.\\n\\n112\\n00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.410\\nAnd so that's usually a bit of a preference for me\\n\\n113\\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.243\\nwhen choosing a photograph.\\n\\n114\\n00:07:16.254 --> 00:07:18.837 line:15% \\n(gentle music)\\n\\n",

As the camera pans in and out, Duffy whispers the word â€˜homoâ€™ to the foliage, reclaiming the word and opening it up to interpretation. The disorienting contrast between the repetition of the derogatory term and the joyful flowers and bright colour reflects the artistâ€™s attempt to position herself in the world around her.",

Born in Brisbane, Darling studied science at the University of Queensland and undertook postgraduate study in the Medical School of Monash University. Though she worked as a scientist, her interests encompass a variety of social and cultural concerns, including art, music and health. Darling had long admired the work of photographer Anne Zahalka before she was commissioned to make this portrait. Fittingly, Zahalka photographed Darling in the Gallery, next to a bouquet of brightly coloured Australian natives in magenta, yellow and cream.",

The portrait is by Anne Zahalka created in 2010. It is a colour, photographic transparency presented in a backlit light box, with a glossy black frame, measuring 119cm tall by 82cm wide.\\n\\nAn elegant woman in her middle years in a knee-length apricot dress, heels and gold accessories. Marilyn Darling stands slightly left of centre, in the foreground, front on. The sunshine streaming in behind her creating a halo in her short, wavy, platinum blond hair.\\n\\nMarilynâ€™s face is tanned, her grey-blue eyes look straight towards us. Her vibrant coral coloured lips are upturned in a closed-mouth smile. Â¬\\n\\nShe wears gold hoop earrings, and a chunky bone and gold necklace made up of curving segments linked together, and it rests in a tight, flat ring on her collar bone. The necklace is framed by the collar of her apricot dress. Just beneath the collar, on the right, glints a small gold pin.\\n\\nMarilynâ€™s bare arms are folded across her waist. On her left hand is a gold and diamond ring, and on her wrist, a slim gold watch. Her short nails are painted the same coral as her lips. \\n\\nMarilynâ€™s dress is knee-length and her slender legs are golden. She centres her weight on her left leg, while her right leg extends out slightly to the side, both feet facing forward. She wears cream, peep-toe high-heels, and her toenails are lacquered with coral polish.\\n\\nDiagonal shadows are cast by her legs, across the foyer floor, veering to the right lower corner of the portrait. \\n\\nOn Marilyn Darlingâ€™s right, inside the gallery doors is a substantial bouquet of brightly coloured Australian native flowers, in magenta, yellow and cream amidst grey-green foliage. The flowers spring from a stainless-steel cylindrical vessel, resting on a waist high, rectangular concrete plinth. \\n\\nFurther on, there is an abundance of architectural detail, she stands just inside the doors. Triangular, pale timber at ceiling height, a line of round air conditioning vents above head height, and thin wooden vertical struts running down over glass to meet the foyer floor. The floor is pale grey stone, glistening with reflected light. \\n\\nBeyond the doors, the forecourt is flooded with bright white sunshine, and on our left is a large, bright orange sculpture. Past the sculpture is blurred greenery. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Rory Walker**",

I was always thinking about other portraits.\\n\\nAnne Zahalka, Iâ€™d really admired her work, and it was Andrew who really suggested her strongly. Iâ€™d no idea what an enormous amount of equipment she would have to bring with her from Sydney. They drove, she brought a couple of assistants, and they took an enormous amount of time setting up. And then they said, well, â€œstep in for the shotâ€. But like an hour and a half later, they were still taking photographs, so as a control freak it was fantastic because there were sheets of proofs, absolutely masses. And as always, the best ones are right at the end. And I think that's often true of photography.\\n\\nIâ€™d wanted it to be really showing the building in some way, because Iâ€™d endowed the flowers, as something Iâ€™d always wanted to do, because I think museums that have got a large floral arrangement as you walk in just look fantastic. And then there was whatâ€™s of course called the orange blob, was something else that weâ€™d given. It was just a great experience. I loved every minute of it.Â Â ",

Michael Zavrosâ€™ inclusion of the flower in his portrait of Australiaâ€™s 25th Governor-General, The Hon Dame Quentin Bryce AD CVO (b. 1942) is deeply intentional. The flower has personal significance for Bryce as it is the emblem of the Special Taskforce on Domestic and Family Violence in Queensland, which she chaired from 2014â€“15. The presence of this bloom is a poignant connection to the work Bryce was doing at that time. As she reveals, the â€˜beautiful flowers we used as a symbol for the work I was doing in domestic violence â€¦ it has a concept of justice or strength about it.â€™ These proteas could be interpreted as symbolic of the characteristics of Bryce â€“ her strong character and the experience and wisdom she has demonstrated throughout her career. Like the portraitâ€™s subject, these flowers are not to be trifled with; their appearance conveys consistency, dependability â€“ they command our attention and respect.",

There certainly were some knockbacks that I had. I mostly kept them to myself because, you know, we were brought up to be pretty stoic in a way, my generation. Little girls were to be seen and not heard, so you sort of took those knockbacks on the chin a bit. But amongst them were people whom I remember with respect and a deep affection, who were great supporters, who encouraged me and anything Iâ€™ve ever achieved in my life has been with wonderful support and encouragement.\\n\\nBut I have to say, Iâ€™m also very conscious of women who donâ€™t have the supports and the opportunities and the encouragement that they need. And very often they are women living on the edges of our society in many ways. My mantra for a long time has been â€˜You can have it all but not all at the same timeâ€™. I think thatâ€™s quite an important thing for women to remember when they are taking on all the responsibilities that they have and the hard road to fulfilling their ambitions, their hopes and their dreams.\\n\\nSo, I am very keen to do anything I can to support and encourage them quietly in the background. Thatâ€™s what I like to focus on now, is this passing on to younger women the sort of help and guidance and encouragement particularly that was given to me by older women.",

                "transcript": "This is a landscape portrait 112cm high by 152cm wide. In the immediate foreground against a stark, white background there are three elements to the composition; the surface of a wooden table, a glass vase with flowers and a life size figure of Quentin Bryce cropped to below her hip. The simple, almost forensic, style of the work gives a crisp, light focus to a portrait of a dignified, older woman.\\n\\nQuentin Bryceâ€™s slim figure stands in front of a long, narrow, antique table. Its polished brown surface stretches almost the full width of the portrait. Its legs are spiral-turned. A tall crystal cut glass vase supports three king proteas, each with foliage. The longest of the woody stems leans up and out to the left towards the edge of the table, another stem leans out in the same direction, its flowerhead turned so the bright pink tips of the outer petals circle the central pale pink dome of the flower. A third, shorter protea faces upwards, its small, closed head a soft pale pink. \\n\\nWater in the vase distorts the shapes of the proteasâ€™ stiff brown stems. To the left of the vase, a fallen leaf creates a shadow as it touches the tableâ€™s surface, like the arch of a spoon. \\n\\nQuentin Bryce stands with the vase behind her right elbow. She is turned slightly to the left, looking back at us with a penetrating gaze. Her immaculate, thick, ash blonde hair is parted just off -centre and falls around her ears, cut so it tapers at her nape. \\n\\nQuentin has a high forehead and regular features; her clear, sun-kissed complexion is highlighted by light foundation. Her skin shows signs of age, particularly the furrowed lines between her thin eyebrows; around her eyes, cheeks, chin and neck. She wears large, round, gold and pearl earrings that draw attention to her eyes and lips. Her sparkling blue eyes and bright red lipstick emphasis the directness of her smile. \\n\\nQuentin is dressed in a long-sleeved, two-piece, butter-coloured linen suit with a generous, dove shaped collar. The wide collar is secured at her nape by one of three large cloth- covered buttons. She wears a small gold bar brooch below her left lapel. Her arms are folded, her left hand cradled in the crook of her right arm and her left hand gently holds her right elbow. \\n\\nShe has freckles and veins close to the surface of the thin skin on the backs of her hands. Both hands have silver rings and on her right wrist she wears a polished silver bangle. \\n\\nThe linen jacket finishes at her hips, her matching tailored skirt has light creases indicative of sitting.\\n\\n  \\n**Audio description written by Annette Twyman and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

                "transcript": "- When I was about 16, I was pretty clear about what I wanted to do, it was a pretty bold, enormous ambition; 'to change the world'. The altruism that one has at that age, I see it in young ones that I talk to now. I'd always had in the back of my mind doing law, but you know, when I was talking about it at 16 in my last year at school, people said to me, women don't do that, you can't do that. Anyway, in my third year, I changed into arts law. So I am often asked the question about what motivated me to make the choices that I did. It was very much about the times and the opportunities, the advantages of having parents who were committed to our having careers, having independence as well as a family life. I am very conscious of the debt of gratitude I owe to my parents, really for their focus on our education. How lucky we were as a family of girls in the 40's to have a mother and father whose top priority was giving us the best education they possibly could. And I had some role models. I remember I used to have this photograph of one of the first women judges in England, Rose Heilbron. It was all sort of cut out and stuck up, sticky taped in my school Bible. I remember the first girl I knew to go to University and to do science, that was a big thing. Most women were in a very narrow range of occupations and you became conscious of that, leaving school looking at what girls were going to do.\\n\\nThe beautiful flowers were used as a symbol for the work I was doing in domestic violence. We used the protea in different ways and it has a concept of justice and strength about it. It's a great privilege to be painted by a portrait painter like Michael Zavros. A bit scary too. He's a person who I've known for a long time. I went to some of his very earliest exhibitions. We didn't talk about the portrait a lot. I really thought I should just leave that to him. We talked a lot while he was doing sketches. But not so much about how he was going to do it or what it might look like but became obvious as I was sitting and standing but not the emphasis or the interpretation that it would present. This is a \"pinch me\" moment for me talking about these things that are so close to my heart but in the context of a portrait, my portrait, hanging in the National Portrait Gallery. The magic of portraiture or portrait painting that some how fascinates us all.\\n\\nAnything I've ever achieved in my life has been with wonderful support and encouragement. I'm always conscious of the enormous debt that I owe to women who worked in solidarity to open up opportunities for me, for my generation in education in particular. Women indeed do have an enormous role in the economic life of their country and all women need independence. That's why the Women's Movement has been so powerful and so important, women supporting each other. Men have to be in that too, this is about family life. That is at the heart, the very heart, of our society. I feel very deeply about equality and opportunity in a true sense.",

To commemorate her coronation a pink rose named â€˜Queen Elizabethâ€™ was bred by the American rose grower Dr Walter Lammerts, which has since been used to cultivate 30 additional varieties. Fifty years later, on the occasion of Her Majestyâ€™s 2002 Golden Jubilee, flowers once again became an important symbol for the monarch, seen here in the bold backdrop featured in Melbourne-born Polly Borlandâ€™s iconic photographic portrait. This time, the flowers were poppies, immortalised in Finnish brand Marimekkoâ€™s iconic Unikko wallpaper design, created by Maija Isola in 1964. One of the few photographers commissioned to take a portrait for the Jubilee, Borland was allowed five minutes for the shoot, which started as soon as the Queen was in front of the camera. â€˜All of a sudden, I see this woman, whoâ€™s a lot more petite than Iâ€™d imagined, a lot more beautiful than Iâ€™d imagined, a lot richer than Iâ€™d imagined,â€™ Borland says. â€˜I couldnâ€™t talk, I couldnâ€™t remember anything.â€™",

I couldn't talk, I couldn't remember anything, you know I went into this kind of other zone, and completely overwhelmed that all of a sudden the Queen is there who is differentiated by blood. You know, more than just fame, but this woman has a bloodline that is different. And even though I'm not a royalist I was like â€˜Oh my godâ€™. Finally when I found my voice I just started babbling on but she was in a hurry. She was late. She had to go and host a lunch and I'd been told she doesn't really like being photographed. So she just wanted to get it over and done with. And sheâ€™s in front of the camera and Iâ€™m still talking. And then all of a sudden, the minder calls, â€˜two minutesâ€™. And I hadn't taken one roll of film. So he completely stitched me up. And then I just went into total panic. Took one roll. And at one point, I needed her to step to the left and I couldn't think of left. So I was down on my knee, hands and knees, trying to grab her ankles. Luckily, my husband stepped in and said, â€˜No, ma'am, Polly means step to the leftâ€™, grabbed me and got me back behind the camera. I mean, the whole thing was just a total kind of joke. And then she sees the floral background and she goes, â€˜Oh, I like thatâ€™. And also the ring flash was super bright. So by the time she left, she said, â€˜Oh, I think you've blinded meâ€™. And it's a miracle that I got two good photos, a miracle. And that really was the end of my portrait career. Interestingly, even though it was sort of like, probably the pinnacle â€“ I was commissioned by the palace, she's probably one of the most famous women in the world â€“ it kind of was almost like, well, I've done that. And I don't really need to keep doing it.",

Her hair gleams silver and is combed neatly straight up, curving either side of her forehead in soft curls to just behind her ears. She wears round white pearl earrings.\\n\\nQueen Elizabethâ€™s skin is creamy smooth, marked by fine lines across her forehead and around her eyes. Her eyebrows are full, light, and travel down, defining the outer edges of her eyes. A dusting of pale shimmering eyeshadow brightens her eyelids.\\n\\nQueen Elizabethâ€™s eyes are sapphire blue. Her nose is straight, two creases run from her nostrils beneath full cheeks to the outer corners of her mouth. Her lips are painted a bright coral pink and are slightly parted, showing the top row of her teeth.\\n\\nThree strands of matching pearls adorn her neck, resting against the silky blue fabric of her top. A star-shaped brooch, covered in brilliant white diamonds, is pinned to the left shoulder of her suit jacket. Her jacket has notched lapels and is single breasted, fastened together by 3 large round dark-blue pearlescent buttons. It has long sleeves and reaches to hip level. The colour is the same intense electric-blue with a soft sheen as her clothing beneath. However an intricate checkerboard pattern is woven into the fabric.\\n\\nQueen Elizabethâ€™s arms are pulled close to her sides. Over her left forearm hangs the black patent leather strap of her handbag and on her wrist is a watch with a gold link band and slim round face. Queen Elizabeth holds her hands in front, the right clasping the left. The skin on her hands is warmer in tone than that of her face and neck. The backs of her hands are marked by age and her unvarnished nails are cut short.\\n\\nThe portrait is cropped at the lower edge just beneath Queen Elizabethâ€™s hands with only a narrow ribbon of her skirt and handbag included. \\n\\nLucinda Shawcross September 2022",

So the story about the Queen is, I'd been told that I was only going to get five minutes, because they were giving all these younger, untried photographers a shot at taking photos of the Queen. The remit was, we only got five minutes. And I had said, right from the beginning, could I bring in my own backdrops? And they'd said yes. So I took in the gold sparkly background, which I'd seen the fabric in an Anne Summers shop window. And then a friend of mine, Martin Grant, the fashion designer, had suggested the famous Marimekko fabric. We go in, we've got a truck, we've got all this equipment. And we set up two cameras, two backdrops, one in front of the other. The minder came in and I was given this protocol. I could curtsy see when she walked in, but I didn't have to. I could bow when she walked in, but I didn't have to. And I should call her ma'am. Spam, ham was how I was to remember ma'am, because I said, \"No, surely it's 'marm'.\" \"No, it's ma'am.\" So I went, okay. And then they said, \"And you need to talk her through what you're going to do.\" I went, okay. And I said to him, \"When are you going to start counting the five minutes?\" \"When she gets in front of the camera.\" I go, okay. So she walks in. All of a sudden I see this woman, who's a lot more petite than I'd imagined, a lot more beautiful than I'd imagined, a lot richer than I'd imagined, a lot, looking very glamorous. And all of a sudden I completely, I couldn't talk, I couldn't remember anything. I went into auto, but the problem was, I'd been given so many options of what that autopilot might look like. And I hadn't picked, thought any of them through, or which one I was.. so I was lost in this sea of choices and quick thinking that, but I couldn't think. And completely overwhelmed that all of a sudden, there's this, the Queenie's there. I went and shook her hand. I then stepped back. And rather than curtsying, I did what I call the Australian squat, which was, I just bent my knees. So I looked like a total idiot at this point. I introduced everyone, I got that bit right. And then I went into this, finally when I found my voice, I'm just babbling on. But she was in a hurry, she had been, she was late. She had to go and host a lunch. She just wanted to get that. And I'd been told she doesn't really like being photographed. So she just wanted to get it over and done with. Well, I talked, and I talked, and I talked, and she's moving closer to the point of where she needs to be. And she's in front of the camera, and I'm still talking. And then all of a sudden, the minder calls, \"Two minutes!\" And I hadn't taken one roll of film. So he completely stitched me up. Rather than saying, I'm going to start counting now, because he'd said to me, but I hadn't taken any pictures. Because he'd also told me that I had to tell her what I was going to do. So I had three minutes. And then I just went into total panic. Took one roll. The camera was even off kilter, like it was a mess. And at one point I needed to step to the left, and I couldn't think of left. So I was down on my hands and knees trying to grab her ankles. Luckily my husband stepped in and said, \"No, ma'am,Â Polly means stepÂ to the left\", grabbed me, and got me back behind the camera. The whole thing was just a total joke. One roll, and I thought , I better go to the other, he called four minutes or something and I'm like, oh my God. So then we do the next set up, and then she sees the floral background. She's fine with the sparkly gold, because it was golden jubilee. And she goes, ooh, like that. And also the ring flash was super bright, so by the time she left, she said, \"Oh, I think you've blinded me.\" And she walked out the door. Apparently Prince Phillip had been in there the whole time. I didn't even see him. That's how disassociated from the experience I was. And it's a miracle that I got two good photos, miracle. And that really was the end of my portrait career. Interestingly, even though it was probably the pinnacle, it was almost like, well, I've done that, and I don't really need to keep doing that. So yeah, that's the story of the Queen. And luckily, I got two pictures out of it. So that's good, yeah.",

Created in tandem, the sculptures _Heirloom,_ _Phuang Malai_ and _Noi_ are expanded forms of portraiture that pay homage to the artistâ€™s late mother, Noi_._ Beardâ€™s silicone sculptures _Heirloom_ and the newly commissioned work _Phuang Malai_ are fragmented limbs cast from the artistâ€™s own body, entangled with his motherâ€™s possessions: a pair of cheap earrings and her wedding band. These impossible configurations recall the intangible bond between parent and child, as well as the surreal, disembodied mannequins used in visual merchandising. Through these discordant yet entwined associations they question the fluidity of value and worth attached to personal objects. Dotted with fake orchids, the national flower of Thailand, _Phuang Malai_ further embeds this oscillation between authenticity, value, memory and identity.\\n\\n_Noi_ emulates the form of the _bai sri_: Thai floral tributes constructed from organic materials including flowers and banana leaves traditionally used to invoke good luck. Composed from Beardâ€™s late motherâ€™s clothes, the laborious and intricately folded and pinned structure of _Noi_ carries a reflective, devotional quality that celebrates Noiâ€™s personal taste and style.",

Photographs of her fashionable charity balls were regularly published in the society pages, with Byrne often adorned with living blooms. In a 1936 photograph reproduced in the Australian magazine _The Home_, for example, Byrne is pictured in a silk tulle dress with a white camellia in her hair and a spray of white orchids trailing over her shoulder. In this striking portrait by then in-demand portrait painter Richard von Marientreu, commissioned by Byrne herself, she wears a black off-the-shoulder gown with swathes of blush tulle draped over both arms. Her hands delicately caress a pale pink rose symbolising love, appreciation and gratitude.",

Created in tandem, the sculptures _Heirloom,_ _Phuang Malai_ and _Noi_ are expanded forms of portraiture that pay homage to the artistâ€™s late mother, Noi_._ Beardâ€™s silicone sculptures _Heirloom_ and the newly commissioned work _Phuang Malai_ are fragmented limbs cast from the artistâ€™s own body, entangled with his motherâ€™s possessions: a pair of cheap earrings and her wedding band. These impossible configurations recall the intangible bond between parent and child, as well as the surreal, disembodied mannequins used in visual merchandising. Through these discordant yet entwined associations they question the fluidity of value and worth attached to personal objects. Dotted with fake orchids, the national flower of Thailand, _Phuang Malai_ further embeds this oscillation between authenticity, value, memory and identity.\\n\\n_Noi_ emulates the form of the _bai sri_: Thai floral tributes constructed from organic materials including flowers and banana leaves traditionally used to invoke good luck. Composed from Beardâ€™s late motherâ€™s clothes, the laborious and intricately folded and pinned structure of _Noi_ carries a reflective, devotional quality that celebrates Noiâ€™s personal taste and style.",

These portraits of Olley by Adam Knott and Lewis Morley were taken in her infamous Paddington home and studio, bursting with the flowers, fruit, artworks and artefacts in which she found endless inspiration. She was known to never throw anything out, and wilted and dried-out floral arrangements can be seen alongside fresh-cut flowers in the photographs. As Olley once said, â€˜If the house looks dirty, buy another bunch of flowers is my adviceâ€™. Her legacy is not only as a painter but as an arts patron and benefactor: since its foundation in 1990, the Margaret Olley Art Trust has donated many Australian and international artworks to public collections nationwide. Tweed River Art Gallery is home to the Margaret Olley Art Centre, which includes a recreation of Olleyâ€™s studio and living space. In Knottâ€™s portrait, Olley is photographed with her aunt, Mrs Knight.",

She was well-known on the Sydney post-war art scene and her portrait was painted by both Russell Drysdale and William Dobell. Dobellâ€™s portrait of Olley, dressed in a gown fashioned from surplus wartime parachute silk, won the 1948 Archibald Prize. Olley held her first one-person show that year. It was a sell-out, and from that beginning, she held at least one solo exhibition annually. The Art Gallery of New South Wales honoured her long career with a major retrospective show in 1996â€“1997. In 1990, she endowed the Margaret Hannah Olley Art Trust, which has funded acquisitions by many Australian institutions including the National Portrait Gallery. One of Sydneyâ€™s most recognisable arts identities, in 2011 she was again the subject of an Archibald Prize-winning portrait, this time by Ben Quilty. In March 2014, almost three years after Olleyâ€™s death at age 88, the Tweed Regional Gallery opened its Margaret Olley Centre, which includes re-creations of rooms from the late artistâ€™s legendary Sydney home.",

In this series, Valadon often used plants and flowers as iconography to portray her sitters, which can be seen in her portrait of sculptor Frances Joseph as Gaia, the Greek goddess of the earth.

For _In Bloom_, Cosgrave has repurposed her 2010 installation _Red Flower Wall Painting_ as a wallpaper named _He Putiputi Kura_ (meaning â€˜some scarlet red flowersâ€™ in Te reo MÄori). The work originated as a template that the artist projected onto the wall and then painted by hand, resulting in a constellation of flowers that warped and weaved organically through the space. This undulating floral effect has here been transformed into a wallpaper that punctuates the galleries in which the _In Bloom_ exhibition is displayed. This work also sits in dialogue with Polly Borlandâ€™s photograph of Queen Elizabeth II, which features the Finnish Marimekko-brand wallpaper Unikko.",

In the portrait he depicts himself holding a flower in each hand, one living and one dead. Art historian and curator Felicity St John Moore described the paintingâ€™s imagery as an â€˜either-or choice between creation and spiritual deathâ€™. Blackman often used flowers to explore themes such as vulnerability, innocence and alienation. Reflecting on his fascination for flowers, he said: â€˜the flowers evoked the people, in a certain kind of gentility, or substance, or reverence, or sensitivity â€¦ almost like â€¦ the flowers gave the person the identity as well as the person gave the flowers the identity.â€™",

But it was not really a sort of disciplined thing, it wasnâ€™t really a thought-out thing. It was a thing where it was chasing a substance, it was kind of style chasing a substance. Once the substance was realised in some sort of sense, then the operative thing was to make it function properly, make it function fully. Itâ€™s like, sort of, driving a little baby Austin, finally you become a mature enough driver to be able to run an E-type Jag or a very complex piece of machinery. You have the emotional equipment realised, but it is then to make it a public fact, it is then to make it kind of articulate, a real articulate message in plastic terms, that is, it must be, the feeling must be couched properly in paint, the image must be embedded properly in the paint, must be trapped, as Francis Bacon says very well, in the paint.\\n\\nWell, now I work not so haphazardly, get up very early in the morning, go to the studio, clean up all the brushes, tidy up the room, sweep the floor and start working in a very detached sort of way, and work through disinterest to interest, or work, labour, very long hours on making a painting function within itself in a fairly detached sort of way. But this only could have been done by this kind of organic growth of the personality, it couldnâ€™t have been done in the artificial sense, you canâ€™t outside impose thoughts, they have to grow.",

The 1960s saw an increasing minimalism in his paintings, in which he sought to evoke the scale of the Australian landscape through canvases of a single colour dotted with tiny flecks of paint bisected by abrupt horizons. Williams applied the same stark approach to his portraits, which were often of his friends. He met artist Clifton Pugh AO (1924â€“1990) after his return from England. The friends painted together often, and for a time Williams lived and worked at Pughâ€™s bushland retreat, Dunmoochin. Williams made this portrait following Pughâ€™s first heart attack in 1974, after which he convalesced in the Williamsâ€™ house in Hawthorn. In his monograph on Williams, Patrick McCaughey writes that the artist has captured â€˜a touching combination of premature age and residual strengthâ€™ in his friend. The work is characteristically enlivened with touches of vibrant colour on the flowers in the foreground and Pughâ€™s hair.",

But always very upset because whenever they were aware of me, theyâ€™d gallop off, and I used to feel, if I could let them know that Iâ€™m not going to harm them. But perhaps because of other human beings they were scared. And my feeling the whole time was, if I could only get the birds and animals to realise that Iâ€™m not going to harm them.\\n\\nI saw one kangaroo had been shot and I was really upset about this and I used to go back and look at this â€“ remains. Then I got a shock the following spring, that the animal had practically disintegrated, but out of that area where this animal had died, there were these most beautiful orchids. And that gave me the realisation of this continuing cycle, is that this kangaroo had to die to produce something in the soil that produced these orchids, because they werenâ€™t anywhere else, they were just in this one spot. So all the paintings from then on, right up â€˜til halfway through â€™64, were of birds and animals, and this continuing cycle, always the paintings took the form, organic form of a movement, you could almost call it like a circle, â€˜til this trip came up to the north-west, up to the Kimberleys. There I had a very, very big change of feeling. As I said before, I felt myself not belonging to the world â€“ we were some mistake. Going up there, I felt myself starting to belong for the very first time, and itâ€™s made a big change to the paintings, because now Iâ€™m painting human beings, theyâ€™re in all the paintings Iâ€™m doing, because for the first time perhaps, at the age of 40, Iâ€™m feeling myself starting to belong in the world, that is, the world in its total stage, not just human beings and animals but all being one.",

Perhaps best known for his signature series of paintings incorporating schoolgirls with flowers and _Alice in Wonderland_ figures and motifs, he exhibited prolifically throughout his career. Blackmanâ€™s _The family_ is an intimate portrait that depicts close family friends, poet and author Judith Wright, her husband journalist and playwright Jack McKinney, and their daughter Meredith. The work fondly recalls a day when Blackman, his wife, the author Barbara Blackman, and the Wright/McKinney family picnicked at Cedar Creek near the flower farms of Mount Tamborine in Queensland in the winter of 1955. Central to the composition are flowers that partially obscure Wrightâ€™s face and are repeated in Meredithâ€™s hat. Flowers were a recurring motif for Blackman, particularly white daisies, which often appear as a symbol of transience in his works.",

The frame is narrow light wood with a stepped surface. This dark shadowy portrait shows the heads and shoulders of, in a row from the left: Jack McKinney, Judith Wright, and their daughter Meredith McKinney. They are painted in a distinctive stylised manner. \\n\\nThe background is divided horizontally; the top fifth is painted pale cream and the lower part, behind the figures, is a mixture of dark browns and greys. The focus is on the figuresâ€™ faces and hats.\\n\\nJack, on the left, wears a hat with a square box-like crown in washed-out blue above a round reddish brim. His face is blue and almost rectangular. His eyes are on a slant. The eye on our left is lower and larger than the other. Below a dark brow, it is an elongated green almond with a large black iris. The eye on the right is higher on the face, set beneath the hat brim; blue with a black iris and a flash of orange highlighting the eyelid. The straight edges of Jackâ€™s nose run parallel to his cheek. His ear on the far left of the portrait is a loop of apricot and blue with a dark centre. Just below the ear, a hand rests on Jackâ€™s shoulder. The lower part of his face and neck is obscured by deep shadow, only interrupted by a sprig of blue-green foliage. \\n\\nThe central figure, Judith, appears shorter than Jack. Her hat with its much flatter rounded crown and narrow brim does not stand as tall as his. The hat is blue and white striped with dashes of red, orange, and green. Judithâ€™s eyes sit in shade under its brim. They are wide-spaced, blue, with pointed inner corners. Their black irises are positioned towards their rounded outer ends. Just beneath Judithâ€™s eyes, a bunch of flowers of different shapes, sizes, and bright colours, hides the half of her face to our left. On the right her face is painted with smudges of white and pink. A pale haze on either side of her face suggests hair. \\n\\nBetween Judith and Meredith, on our far right, is another brightly coloured bouquet. This seems to be held by one of the figures' hands at the very bottom edge of the portrait.\\n\\nMeredith, on the far right, is smaller and shorter than her parents. Her hat has a square crown with a dome fitted within it sitting on a narrow brim. The hat is patterned with blue, white, yellow, and orange flowers. Beneath the hat is a dark band of shadow concealing Meredithâ€™s eyes. Her face, with grey and white skin, tapers with straight lines to a square chin. Her nose is triangular with a narrow bridge widening out to large, rounded nostrils. Meredithâ€™s lips are small and closed, crimson, outlined with black. On either side of her face is an irregular elongated blue-grey shape, possibly representing hair. In front of her chest is a mass of yellow and blue swirls. Meredith wears a white pointed collar and a floral-patterned top with yellow highlighting her shoulder on the far right of the portrait.",

If I remember correctly, I asked for about 15 sittings. Being the first official portrait that Iâ€™d been given from the Government I was rather a bit scared, you know. Anyway, Mr Rosevear was very co-operative, and it eventually won the Archibald, so, quite good!\\n\\nNow with my own procedure as regards portrait painting, that has varied considerably over the years. At one stage, I used to make a small drawing, say about 15 inches deep, in pencil, and more in the nature of a very accurate map, and then work from that; but later I found that I prefer to draw straight onto the canvas with charcoal, just dust that off and then paint direct. And I also like to have my sitter in front of me the whole time.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™ve been asked to say something about Chips Raffertyâ€™s portrait and how I did it. Well that was painted out in the open in the lawn in his backyard. I had a good many sittings. I remember Chips saying to me, â€˜Youâ€™ve worn a track across my lawn, running backwards and forwards!â€™. I like to have my canvas right alongside my subject and get back from it to make my observations as far as possible.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™ve been asked about any particular highlights in my life. Well, I think one of the most important things that I can remember is my first sale of a drawing. And it was a little drawing of my mother, a pencil drawing of my mother playing the piano. And we had it in the Julian Ashton School sketch club. And I was sitting next to the late Julian Ashton and Julian turned to me and said, â€˜Would you take half a guinea for it?â€™. I said â€˜Sold!â€™.",

With a career spanning five decades, Crock was recognised as one of the worldâ€™s leading orthopaedic surgeons. At the time the portrait was created, Crock was working as Honorary Senior Lecturer and Consultant Spinal Surgeon at Hammersmith Hospital. Reflecting the close friendship between artist and subject, Smithâ€™s portrait focuses on Crockâ€™s personality, creating a strong sense of a contemplative, learned and caring man whose career has been dedicated to healing. The work also alludes to Crockâ€™s longstanding love of the visual arts â€“ one of the artworks depicted in the background is a woodcut by Tate Adams in Smithâ€™s own collection. A single yellow tulip adds a soft touch to the otherwise strong verticals of the composition, echoing the subject of the portrait.",

Preston drew inspiration from the bushland around her harbourside home in Mosman, and became a vigorous campaigner for her vision of a modern Australian art that recognised the unique beauty of native trees and flowers. As Preston noted, â€˜Each flower is individual, they never respond to being turned into bouquets, as roses and violets do. These flowers show form and colour in simple treatment.â€™ This portrait of Preston surrounded by olearias (daisy bush) in her Mosman garden was taken by Harold Cazneaux who, in his prolific 40-year career as a photographer, created a rich catalogue of Sydneyâ€™s mood and people, and produced many photographs that have since attained mythic status. Like many of Cazneauxâ€™s works, this one demonstrates his belief that the best portraits were achieved through photographing in the â€˜natural surroundings of your home and gardenâ€™.",

Here Georgiadis is presented in an Australian landscape overflowing with plants including Queensland bottle trees, banksias and kangaroo paws. The olive tree that peeks in from the right-hand side is a nod to his Greek heritage, while in the lower left is a Peronâ€™s tree frog from Georgiadisâ€™ own garden pond.\\n\\nâ€˜Making art is similar to creating a garden, in that it requires research, planning, creativity and lots of time and patience,â€™ Georgiadis said. â€˜Iâ€™m thrilled to be given this honour, and am humbled that the public voted for me.â€™\\n\\nThe Peopleâ€™s Portrait campaign was supported by the Sid & Fiona Myer Family Foundation.",

Many of Bartonâ€™s intricate paintings are focused on women, often surrounded by an abundance of flowers, fruit and other symbols of femininity and female power. In _Maggie_, Barton combines a statuesque likeness of cook, restaurateur, businesswoman and media personality Maggie Beer AO (b. 1945) with a spellbinding and dream-like personalised symbology of the sitter. In making the work, Barton asked Beer to provide a list of two of her favourite fruit and vegetables from each season. The eight chosen ingredients, including peas, asparagus, peaches, quince, pomegranate and tomatoes, become pictorial elements woven around the central figure. They signify Beerâ€™s passions and personality in the same way that objects were used to identify saints in the history of art. Beer holds her favourite flower â€“ a yellow rose â€“ to her heart, a consciously romantic inclusion by the artist who described her impression that her sitter â€˜fills up a room with light and energy and generosityâ€™. The yellow rose represents friendship, joy and warmth, here adding to the energy radiating from the sitter.",

                "transcript": "The most important thing when you paint a portrait is that your sitter connects to it and is moved by it and transported and identifies with it in some way at the end.\\n\\nI'm Maggie Beer. I am fortunate to be a Barossa person and what do I identify with? Everything about food and music and art and life and joy, finding joy even through the hard times.\\n\\nHi, my name is Del Catherine Barton. I'm an artist. And my practice spans a number of different mediums, but painting is my primary practice.\\n\\nAnd yes, I just feel very moved to be here in this moment with beautiful Maggie. The way that I approach portraiture, because for me it's an in road, I feel like it's a richer level of engagement for the sitter and then hopefully a richer level of engagement for audiences too is to sort of ask my sitter to identify a series of objects essentially or colours as well. And so that was part of our conversation as well and Maggie gave me a very long list. There were way too many friends to choose from.\\n\\nAnd it really is so important and there's a lot of symbolism for me in it as well. Like the pomegranate. You know, the pomegranate I've used as the symbol for my foundation because the ails in the pomegranate, the little tiny ruby eras, seeds of change. And also, you know, I'm a country girl. I grew up with my mom in the veg garden. So for me, Maggie's paradigms around connection to land and the celebration of seasonal produce and the fact that she has, you know, some very specific food loves, you know, there's just so much to celebrate there.\\n\\nAnd on top of that, one thing I didn't know about Maggie's career, which I found out in the context of sitting with her in the studio, is that her career, and I'd much prefer Maggie to speak about this with more specific. but really started with the pheasant. Yes. I mean, the luck of my life was meeting Colin. And we married 16 weeks after we met 53 years ago, so, you know, risk-takers. He has supported every single thing I have ever done. Without him, I would not have achieved nearly, nearly what I have.\\n\\nBut it was the pheasant that was the catalyst for something that was right in front of me. Because I'd left school at 14, because my parents lost their business and bankrupt, I didn't have an education, and so I was always searching for what I wanted to do, yet I'd always cooked, as my family always cooked. And so it was in me, it's instinct. And so with the pheasants, people didn't know what to do with them, because there were no cookery books with pheasants except for European ones. And I never thought of not cooking. I just cooked automatically. And so from the farm shop to the restaurant to everything else.\\n\\nBut really, Colin has made everything possible. Well, now I can see why the pheasant is... It's so important. Because the pheasant in the painting, I approached very much like the idea of an animal familiar. So it's Colin the pheasant looking adoringly at Maggie. I mean, a quality of joy is such an ineffable thing, I suppose. Because again, the challenges of a pictorial space too is that it's a distilled space. It's not a moving space. It's a realized surface, a fixed surface. But with Maggie, who has so much kinetic energy. Again, the level of detail and the very decorative areas with the dotting and, you know, the way that, yeah, even the peas with their tendrils, I really wanted all of that life force energy and that kinetic energy. Again, it was a very central composition and I, as I said before, I wanted that that regal quality, because I do, I revere this woman, but I wanted the whole picture to be pulsating with energy and possibility and beauty. Yeah, the end.\\n\\nIÂ don't like smiles in portraiture, to capture something far more innate. And Maggie does exude that. And I feel like it's very easy for people to romanticise also the life of an artist or the life of a chef. I mean, I know you wear a lot of... Oh, I'm not a chef. No, I'm a chef. No, you're a cook. A cook. So I love that. I love that. I'm a cook. I'm a cook. Yes.",

Aside from Legge and Watters in Sydney, it was the only gallery in Australia showing experimental work in the late 1960s and 1970s. Among the more than 300 artists who showed there were Rooney, Peter Booth, Dale Hickey, Rosalie Gascoigne, James Gleeson, Bill Henson, Tony Tuckson and Stelarc.

Seddon was a polymath â€“ a professor of geology, the history and philosophy of science, and environmental science â€“ who radically rethought our relationship to the environment. He wrote popular books on the Australian landscape embracing diverse points of view, as well as practical guides to gardening. It was through his work as an urban designer that artist Peter Ciemitis first encountered Seddon, whose 1972 essay _Sense of Place_ the artist described as â€˜a must-read text to planners and designers of my generationâ€™. Documenting Seddonâ€™s experience and research into the Swan Coastal Plain in Western Australia (including its flora, soils and climate), _Sense of Place_ has since become a landmark Australian environmental publication. In the portrait, Ciemitis aimed to capture a sense of his subjectâ€™s connection to the landscape: â€˜It is not only a map of George but a reference to a map of place: the environment with which George is concerned.â€™",

In 1933 she joined the management committee of the Royal Children's Hospital, of which she was president from 1954 to 1965 and enabled the establishment of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in 1986. She supported the work of the Walter & Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, the Royal Institute for Deaf & Blind Children, the Burnet Institute and the Bionic Ear Institute. The first woman to serve on the council of the National Gallery of Victoria, she endowed the Dame Elisabeth Murdoch Sculpture Foundation, the Dame Elisabeth Murdoch Arboretum and the Australian Ballet, and supported a range of programs to assist prisoners, children in care and other marginalised groups.\\n\\nDame Elisabeth was integral to the founding of the Victorian Tapestry Workshop â€“ now the Australian Tapestry Workshop â€“ in 1976, making them the obvious choice to create her portrait for the Gallery's collection. Former ATW Director Sue Walker recalls that Murdoch took great interest in the creation of her portrait, 'exhibiting her famous, exuberant excitement at the completion of the weaving'.",

It measures approximately 145 centimetres by 125 centimetres. The image was composed by painter Christopher Pyett, adapted on computer by printmaker Normana Wight and woven on the loom by Merrill Dumbrell.\\n\\nIt is displayed hanging between a white backing board and clear Perspex cover.\\n\\nElisabeth is shown from the chest up, her body angled slightly to the right and facing front on. Behind her, the lush greenery of her garden at Cruden Farm, Langwarrin. Wool and cotton woven threads create a textured surface. Different colour threads in the weft are bundled together to produce a flecked effect, enhancing the texture and blending a palette of creams, pinks and greens together across the surface of the work.\\n\\nGarden foliage fills the background in a simplified and abstracted design. At the top, deep olive-green tones give a sense of depth, transitioning downwards to a range of bright and dark greens and yellows marking abstracted leaves, branches, and shrubbery, and creams and soft pinks creating blossoms.\\n\\nElisabeth is positioned against this garden backdrop, seen from the chest up, facing forward while leaning back and towards the left.\\n\\nHer warm creamy skin has sparse amounts of purples, pinks, and yellow-green threads interwoven, introducing colours used in the background and clothing. Her white hair is pulled back from her face in a loose fashion, tied at the nape of her neck, tendrils escaping. Her forehead is gently furrowed above white framed glasses. Elisabeth gazes outwards with violet eyes lined with gentle wrinkles and hooded eyelids. Her closed blush pink lips are relaxed and have deep crevices on either side above a soft chin. Her neck emerges from a collared blouse woven in an intricate floral pattern of pinks, purples, charcoal grey, white and cream.\\n\\nHer left hand is pulled up to gently rest upon her upper chest. Elisabethâ€™s fingers are slightly splayed, swollen at the joints, showing signs of age and arthritis, revealing a wedding band and a plain faced silver wristwatch.\\n\\nAudio Description written by Alana Sivell and read by Amy Middleby",

And Dame Elisabeth Murdoch was of course the driving force behind the establishment of the workshop.\\n\\n**Christopher Pyett:** I first met Dame Elisabeth at the Tapestry Workshop. She enjoys a sense of humour. She enjoys a joke, she enjoys being teased. We get on well like that.\\n\\n**Sue Walker:** Well, when Andrew Sayers approached us with the idea of weaving a portrait of Dame Elisabeth, I thought it was enormously exciting. Chris Pyett seemed a very suitable person to be involved in this project. He spent time with her in the garden.\\n\\n**Christopher Pyett:** We took a series of photographs totalling about 55, 60. The first series were of her wearing blue. A lot of her character is expressed in her clothing, and the blue she always wears for a formal occasion. I got her to change that, because it never really did her â€¦ you know, none of them look comfortable, do they? But when we got her into a patterned dress it fitted much better.\\n\\n**Sue Walker:** Well, Dame Elisabeth is one of those exceptional people who have imagination and vision, huge human warmth, and then the capacity to follow that up, not only financially but also with their own personal encouragement.\\n\\n**Christopher Pyett:** When I look at the portrait, and look at her eyes, I can just hear her saying to herself, â€œWhat on earth do they want a portrait of me for?â€\\n\\n**Sue Walker:** Her warmth, her enthusiasm, her great joy and delight in everything we did, has just been one of the greatest things in my whole professional life.\\n\\n**Christopher Pyett:** Her contribution to the life of Australia has been absolutely immense, so I think there should be a tapestry portrait of her all over Australia!\\n\\nÂ ",

                "transcript": "For me in architecture nature has a beautiful story. You look at the strength of our flora but also look at the delicacy at the same time. So thereâ€™s a strength and a delicacy. I love the idea of the legibility of the strength. I love the delicacy of the edges. And so in my work, I like to articulate that which is structure, that which is skin, that which is edge. These are things that are in nature in this part of the world and I have endeavoured in my career to try and understand this landscape of ours and be able to integrate these elements not in a determined way but in a very relaxed way. So that there is the articulation of elements without it being such that you are forced to look at it. I donâ€™t like an architecture that is saying to me, Look at me, look at me, look at me. I want an architecture thatâ€™s quiet, that reveals itself quietly, and the more you start to see it, the more you start to understand it.\\n\\nThe roots of architecture remain relevant. If you go beyond the roots of architecture, about space, about order, about structure, about understanding nature and structure â€¦ If you go and just do something for the sake of it, for example, youâ€™ll hear students talking about, Oh I wanted to do this and I wanted to do that. Thatâ€™s delinquent. What does the brief call for? What does the site call for? What does the economics call for? What does the structure call for, what are the materials available? These are the things â€“ itâ€™s not what I want. Itâ€™s what these things are asking to be addressed.\\n\\nI am very happy at the age of over 80 now still practising like mad and still enjoying it as I did as a young architect.",

She lectured in music at the University of Sussex before returning to Australia to take up an Australia Council grant that enabled her to work full-time as a composer between 1977 and 1981. She had already written one of her best-known works, As I crossed a bridge of dreams, which is part of the standard contemporary choir repertoire, but during this period she wrote various chamber works, the oratorio The Death of Captain Cook, and the choral symphony Coal River. In 1981 she became the founding head of Hong Kong University's Department of Music, and in 1990 Professor and Head of the Department of Music at the University of Sydney. While working in Hong Kong she wrote the children's opera The Little Mermaid for the Australian Opera. Boyd gained wider fame as a public advocate of increased funding for Australian universities as the focus of the Bob Connolly/Robin Anderson documentary Facing the Music in 2001.",

                "transcript": "One of my earliest musical experiences is the memory of my aunt playing the piano and singing in the adjacent lounge room to our â€“ well what was still called then the nursery, on this country property. Also, I used to listen to the radio a lot, in fact one of my favourite games was playing with the frequencies of radios and seeing what kinds of statics and sounds I could pick up, and of course, short wave was just fantastic and I was able to often, during the evening, pick up neighbouring Asian stations and so on, and this music really excited me as a child. Whenever I heard music I was always drawn to it. I had to go and listen to it. At about the age of six, my sister sent me a recorder and a teach-yourself manual so, of course, I taught myself to play the recorder in a very short time. This again was something which was very important to me as a means of expression and I, in fact, started writing quite â€“ well, bizarre scores, really the notation of which meant nothing to anybody except myself, but I used to derive a great deal of enjoyment from playing these weird symbols that Iâ€™d managed to put down onto paper.\\n\\nPerhaps my attraction to the sound of shortwave and the static and so on that was created by the radio is a result of my trips by air, the first one of which I undertook as a small child at the age of two. The sounds of the engines of the plane even fascinated me, and the variation in the contrasting timbres and dynamics of what happened when you were actually up in the air. I think probably my fascination with sound of all kinds was a result of living in a silent or a comparatively silent environment in the country, and so therefore these sounds of the city, of machines, of planes, in my rare contacts with them, are all the more meaningful to me.",

Renowned for her exciting blend of Cantonese and Australian cuisine, Kwong is an advocate for native, organic and biodynamic ingredients, and uses food as a catalyst for positive social impact and cultural exchange. She learnt the finer points of Cantonese cooking in her mother Paulineâ€™s kitchen. At age 25, after a career in graphic design, Kwong apprenticed with Neil Perry at Rockpool, and within two years was made head chef at Perryâ€™s Wokpool. In 2000 she opened the restaurant Billy Kwong in Surry Hills with her friend, Bill Granger, taking over the restaurant a year later. It was a Sydney staple for 19 years. Kwong has collaborated with photographer Simon Griffiths on several books, including _My China: A feast for all the senses_ (2007) and _It Tastes Better_ (2010). Here she is captured by Griffiths in motion with a basket full of fresh produce and flowers, as if on the way home from the markets.",

Her Fitzroy restaurant Stephanieâ€™s was a Melbourne institution for 21 years and her Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation has educated tens of thousands of children. Alexanderâ€™s 17 books include her bestselling _The Cookâ€™s Companion_, a staple in many Australian homes. In this portrait by Tsering Hannaford, Alexander is dressed in luxe purple florals. In addition to being Alexanderâ€™s favourite colour, purple evokes the forthrightness of the suffragettes. With her sustained commitment to wellbeing through an appreciation of fresh, homegrown food, Alexander has channelled her career into one of advocacy and community engagement.",

His passion for quality, seasonal and locally sourced produce is reflected in this exuberant portrait by Murray Fredericks and Lisa Giles. A play on 16th-century Italian artist Caravaggioâ€™s _Boy with a basket of fruit_, Moran is classically posed and almost dwarfed by the abundance of fruit and blooms he carries.",

Photo by Ingvar Kenne, 2009.\\n\\nThe portrait is approx. one metre square showing a full length, standing view of Alexis in a blackened, burnt-out landscape of predominately bare trees.  \\nThe upper half of the photograph features a pale, greyish-white sky with tall, burnt tree trunks extending up and out to the sky beyond. In the upper left corner, several trees twist and bend across each other.\\n\\nIn the background and halfway down the photo, the hazy curve of a distant hill crosses through the landscape. Numerous blackened and bare trees cover the sloping ground in front.\\n\\nThe figure of Alexis occupies the centre and lower half of the scene. To the left of Alexis and slightly behind, a large black tree trunk stands tall, reaching up and out beyond the portrait. Sprouting from the trunk are several bright green patches of leafy new growth. \\n\\nAlexis stands on a sloped area of ash covered earth, left blackened and charred by fire.  \\nShe looks directly at us, eyes squinting, mouth closed, with a look of sadness or dismay. Her auburn shoulder length hair is slightly curly, and part of her fringe is swept back. A segment hangs raggedly on her forehead.\\n\\nThe left side of her body is angled slightly forward, and she wears a black round- necked top under a black zippered jacket. Her zipper open to mid-torso, the jacket lining and collar is a dark grey,. Both her hands are tucked into her practical jacket pockets. Her pale right hand is partly visible. \\n\\nAlexis wears long black pants and tan coloured moccasins.\\n\\nBurnt branches, twigs and debris are scattered around her. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Pauline McCreath and voiced by Rory Walker**",

The sculpture Phuang Malai is an expanded form of portraiture that pays homage to the artistâ€™s late mother, Noi. This newly commissioned work features fragmented limbs cast from the artistâ€™s own body, entangled with one of his motherâ€™s most precious possessions: her wedding band. This impossible configuration recalls the intangible bond between parent and child, as well as the surreal, disembodied mannequins used in visual merchandising. Through these discordant yet entwined associations, Beard questions the fluidity of value and worth attached to personal objects. Dotted with fake orchids, the national flower of Thailand, _Phuang Malai_ further embeds this oscillation between authenticity, value, memory and identity.",

This effect lends the sitter a mannequin-like pallor and recalls the numerous glossy fashion spreads she has appeared in over the years. Seubert won the Ford Models Supermodel of the World competition in 1990, aged 17. Signing with the Paris-based agency Karin, she lived in Paris and then New York for the next two decades, walking the runway for Dior, Hermes, Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Versace, and appearing in editorials for magazines such as _Vogue_, _Marie Claire_, _Harperâ€™s Bazaar_ and _Elle_. Ingvar Kenne took this photograph during one of Seubertâ€™s regular trips home. In line with Kenneâ€™s deceptively simplistic and intimate style, there was no hairdresser or makeup artist for the shoot. As Seubert recalled: â€˜Iâ€™m like, â€œOh my god.â€ Worst nightmare. But I mean, the photos were beautiful, and it was quite an interesting shoot because it was full sunlight.â€™",

                "transcript": "The previous year to the year I was in the Dolly Covergirl Competition, Kate Fischer had actually won it, and she was at the same school, at Girls Grammar. My friend said, \"Well if she can win it, \"you can win it too.\" So we took some photos and sent them in, and then I was a finalist. And my little blurb, I mean it's quite fashionable if you're into STEM, as everyone is these days, but my favourite subject was maths, and I loved skiing. Because I didn't win, I just started working on weekends and in school holidays. And I think I was in year 10 when I was in the competition, so through year 11 and 12 I gradually started working a bit more.\\n\\nMy first jobs were for a magazine called _Follow Me_. And then a couple of _Vogue_ jobs, _Harper's Bazaar_ was around then as well. When I was 17, I had an Australian _Vogue_ cover which was great, and some advertising clients, and off I went. I kind of did a preliminary trip when I was in year 12, I did the _Ford Supermodel Competition_, and I went to L.A. by myself. I won that competition and then went to New York for a couple of weeks, so I'd had a little taste of what it was going to be like, and then I went back to school.\\n\\nSo I finished year 12, and then off to Paris. And I just started going on castings. I thought I had great pictures in my portfolio, but people over in Paris looked at them and like, \"hmm,\" you know, they're kind of a little bit, \"daggy Australian,\" in a way. So I started working, got more pictures and then started doing shows. Then I got very busy traveling and... so many markets around, there's Paris, Germany, Spain, Italy. I was flying from one job to the next. Sometimes you didn't come home in between. But I was kind of just let free. I don't know if I'd do that with my kids now.\\n\\nBack in the '90s, you would either get a telephone call from your agency in the afternoon before and check what you had to do for the next day, or sometimes you got a fax. You would have to go and visit a client and show them your pictures, maybe try on some clothes, talk to them about what you'd been doing. It's more of a collaboration. The client and the photographer, usually an art director as well. They will all say, \"This is what we'd like.\" They often have reference images. They can tell you a story.\\n\\nI used to do John Galliano's fashion shows. And he would always make this huge story, and each character, which was essentially each dress or outfit, had a story and a part in the story. So when you were walking around through the scene, the set, you would be imagining that you were this lady on the rooftop who was running away from something. There was always a little story. But I think there was a difference between putting on a Galliano dress, it just made you feel amazing. So just channeling that and thinking about how fabulous you look is really the way it works, I think. 'Cause if you don't believe it, no one else will.\\n\\nWhen I was 24, I was based in Paris. I used to come home three times a year, so I was home for Christmas, home for August, and there was usually either I'd meet mum and dad somewhere, or I came home for an extra trip. And I often worked in Sydney while I was home, and the portrait that's hanging, it was funny, because I was so used to turning up at a shoot and having hair and makeup, and they would turn me into a different character. This time, they're like, \"Oh no, we just want you.\" Like, what are you talking about? Where's the hairdresser? \"Oh, we just want it to look like you did your own hair.\" Are you serious? And no makeup? \"No, no, look how beautiful you are!\" I'm like, \"Oh my god.\" Worst nightmare. My hair is hard to do for a hairdresser at the best of times, so I was a little bit in shock. But I mean, the photos were beautiful, and it was quite an interesting shoot because it was full sunlight and flash, I think. So the lighting is quite harsh. There's definitely a difference between the light in Australia and the light everywhere else. And, yeah, I've got my little bunch of flowers.",

After immigrating, he worked as a waiter while studying fashion design at East Sydney TAFE and Sydneyâ€™s National Art School. In 1993 he opened the Akira Isogawa boutique in Woollahra, and swiftly established a reputation for his bold and intelligent clothes. At Sydneyâ€™s Australian Fashion Week in 1996, he sent all his models out wearing red socks from Gowings because he couldnâ€™t afford shoes for them; but he has shown at every Fashion Week since, and since 1998 he has shown twice annually in Paris. He has exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art, and Sydneyâ€™s Object Galleryâ€™s exhibition of his construction techniques is said to have been its most successful ever show. The National Gallery of Victoriaâ€™s _Akira Isogawa: Printemps EtÃ©_ in 2004-2005 was the first solo exhibition of an Australian designerâ€™s work to be shown at one of its major art institutions and later toured to Singapore, Manila and Bangkok. In 2005 Isogawa was depicted on the â€˜Australian Legendsâ€™ series of postage stamps and in 2007 he was named the countryâ€™s first Fashion Laureate. He has designed costumes for four Sydney Dance Company productions and for the Australian Balletâ€™s production of Graeme Murphyâ€™s _Romeo and Juliet_ in 2010. Sydneyâ€™s Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences showed the retrospective _Akira Isogawa_ at 2018-2019. Since the Woollahra boutique closed in 2017, Australiaâ€™s only two Akira boutiques are in the Strand Arcade, Sydney, and Fortitude Valley, Brisbane.",

Well now actually I create fashion. But back then, actually, I was consuming fashion and that's how much I loved [it].  \\nJapanese culture is so different from Western ones. My grandparents had a house next door. They were all wearing actually traditional clothes â€“ kimono. What I noticed about kimono is actually they're made out rectangular shaped cloth. And they have no shapes. Whereas actually, Western clothes has a particular shape that enhance, particularly actually for female, the femininity of female body, but whereas actually kimono is totally unisex. I mean, I've never actually designed kimono myself. But being a kimono designer, I imagine actually, they work on texture, colour, print, and so on, because it's a highly textile driven fashion, and then to me, that's what Japanese fashion is all about. You know, when I design my own collection, I never really force myself to express my Japanese entity, but I feel that it just comes up naturally. And I think what's interesting is that not just, you know, designing something so traditionally Japanese, but then I kind of actually manage to fuse with Australian ease I guess actually. Australia has got this particular attitude â€“ friendly to start with â€“ but it's quite actually casual about things, you know. I feel actually my design is a result of actually, you know, some Japanese heritage with Australian attitude, which is actually friendly and easy.",

Rooneyâ€™s subjects included surrealist painter Peter Booth (b. 1940), who gained widespread recognition through the inclusion of his large architectural â€˜blockâ€™ paintings in the National Gallery of Victoriaâ€™s exhibition _The Field_ in 1968. Rooney captured Booth outside his studio with a cigarette; the bouquet of roses next to him innocuous against the concrete and corrugated iron of the inner-city landscape. Of the series Rooney wrote: â€˜These portraits were to be as perfect as I could make them. There were certain rules â€“ to use available light, no matter how dim (long exposures and a hand-held camera), and no cropping.â€™",

This portrait depicts the matriarch at ease on a floral-patterned sofa, wearing an elegant, yet relaxed, floor-length black kaftan. To her left is a simple vase filled with overblown pale pink peonies, which signify love, romance, affection and happiness. Following her husband Sidney Myerâ€™s death in 1934, Myer established the Sidney Myer Charitable Trust (later Fund), was a Board member of the Royal Melbourne Hospital for four decades, and was a patron of many organisations. Pinned to Myerâ€™s dress in this portrait is her Badge of the Damehood of the Order of the British Empire, which she was awarded in 1960 for her service to the Red Cross and her tireless philanthropy for cancer and heart disease research.",

See is a Chinese-Australian artist who questions, honours and investigates her cultural inheritance and family experience through her artistic practice. Her work connects the traditions of European silhouette portraiture and Chinese papercutting from Guangdong Province, where her motherâ€™s family originates. In the series of 16 intricate paper cuts from which these works derive, See represents members of the Chinese-Australian community who made major but often unrecognised contributions to society in the 19th century. See says of her motivation for making the portraits: â€˜these personal histories became invisible. So it wasnâ€™t just that they were excluded from parts of community life, they just were never recorded. They didnâ€™t exist, more or less.â€™ Each work incorporates a silhouette based on a photograph, an object representing their achievement, and a floral symbol of an introduced, invasive or endemic species including red silk cotton tree flower (symbolic of Guangdong Province), jasmine flower, common heath and hibiscus.",

In this photograph, he captures the tenderness between the spouses as they lie quite literally on a bed of roses. Lizotte, who is also Jimmy and Janeâ€™s nephew, recalls asking them for references for the portrait: â€˜Jane had come to me with a French love poem, alongside a series of paintings by Chagall ... I wanted to create a floating illusion, and to incorporate the roses that Jimmy picks from their garden and arranges for Jane every day.â€™ Not just a romantic backdrop, the couple often give each other rose bushes for their garden as gifts for special occasions. The metaphor of the rose is not lost on them. Considering the flower in relation to their relationship, the couple observed: â€˜Itâ€™s not always a bed of roses. Itâ€™s not always easy, thereâ€™s thorns ... but itâ€™s about living through that and sharing those experiences.â€™",

                "transcript": "- I wanted to do their love story justice too, you know. How, how do you capture that and sum it up in a picture? But I wanted to, to pic Jimmy in a way that, you know we're not often used to seeing him. I wouldn't say submissive is the word, but he's, looks, at peace and very calm and,\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- and gentle, you know, his eyes are closed. He's being embraced. Well, he's embracing Jane. They're almost like a, a ying and yang. And I feel like that's what my auntie is to, to my uncle's.\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- You know, she balances his energy out.\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- Because we're used to seeing pictures of him and he is a tough guy and he does scream on stage.\\n\\n- But that's not, who I know.\\n\\n- That's what I do. That's what I do there.\\n\\n- But, you know, I'm not, not like that at home. I'm, you know,\\n\\n- No.\\n\\n- I'm different at home. Because we're close, we, you know, but we'd spoke about the actual doing the photograph and what we wanted to achieve with it as well, didn't we?\\n\\n- [Jesse] Yeah.\\n\\n- It was sort of, you know, Jane had a lot of, a lot of input.\\n\\n- Oh, well, the idea was Elizabeth's poem. We had a beautiful French friend who wrote a, a love story. Yeah.\\n\\n- Of, of us, how she saw our love and she put together this little book of Marc Chagall, Marc Chagall and Bella. It really sort of spoke something about our relationship.\\n\\n- [Jesse] Yeah.\\n\\n- But then, you came up with the idea of Uncle Jimmy's Roses.\\n\\n- We have a beautiful garden at home. And the rose patch particularly, that's the only one I can look, sort of look after, because I'm not not that great a gardener. But friends would give us, give me roses, instead of,\\n\\n- Yeah, for your 60.\\n\\n- we don't want gifts.\\n\\n- What happened was, everybody brought rose.\\n\\n- Yeah. For me, for as, as a-\\n\\n- So we created this,\\n\\n- Rose garden,\\n\\n- amazing rose garden.\\n\\n- They grow so well. I, I don't do that much, but I would go down and and pick roses for, for Jane all through lockdown. And every day I'd, I'd pick a new bunch and say, look at this. Isn't this great?\\n\\n- You know, and this smell beautiful, like these, like these are from the garden. And the whole metaphor of the roses and you know, things, you know, love's not always, you know, easy,\\n\\n- a bed of roses.\\n\\n- It's not always a bed of roses. It's not always easy,\\n\\n- Sort of thorns.\\n\\n- And it takes work.\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- And there's thorns. It's not always gonna, it's not always gonna be great. But the, but it's about living through that and, and sharing those experiences.\\n\\n- [Jane] There's many layers too.\\n\\n- [Jesse] Mm.\\n\\n- [Jimmy] Yeah. And all the symbols in that. Just in the roses, coming from our garden.\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- And you know, Jesse being involved, like you said, just the family capturing, and he knows us, you know and he's known us all his life and through, he knows our warts and all, you know and we're individuals there too. And that's just, all these messages are important.\\n\\n- Mm hmm.\\n\\n- You know, the bed of roses, the, the you've got to fight those thorns. All of that.\\n\\n- Mm.\\n\\n- [Jesse] For me, it started quite young, photography. I was like eight or nine years old. A family friend of ours, Wendy McDougall, she put a camera in my hand and, and I just thought it was magic. You know, as a kid, eight or nine years old, we'd go out and I'd take pictures and then she'd develop them in the dark room. And I just thought it was the coolest thing ever, you know to be able to freeze moments in time. And, and, and so she had a huge influence on me for sure. You know, but, also just my father and, and my uncle. Their work ethic, you know, and just their prolific output you know, that has been a huge impact on me. And, and seeing, seeing their dedication to their craft and just how relentless they are with that, I think.\\n\\n- I think music and, and photography and music and art, and and the, the all sort of expressions of the soul. And, and, and it even down to the fact of, you know like working together and make album covers and think some the best album covers are made working together within the family. Writing songs with, with, with Jesse's dad.\\n\\n- It's a blessing, isn't it?\\n\\n- It's really,\\n\\n- That you have that. it's really incredible.\\n\\n- Mm.\\n\\n- And when you get to work\\n\\n- Be able to work.\\n\\n- with people that\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- you're that close to, they, you know, there's there's just this understanding and, and, and, and ease. And you know, that you and I think they're just all expressions of love and the soul, you know, and they bring people together.\\n\\n- Well, they're nearly everyone in the family's a musician or an artist. So I felt like I sort of rebelled by not,\\n\\n- You're an artist. pursuing music. Well in the end, I, I,\\n\\n- Oh yeah.\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- I suppose, you know, I, yeah, like chose a creative path. But I remember going to the Portrait Gallery on school excursions and, and seeing the works hung on the walls and just thought it was so monumental, almost, you know, somewhat unattainable. I thought, wow, it'd be nice to see my pictures hung here but I could never see that happening, you know? And so I was very, I was very blessed to, you know, get the opportunity to shoot Jane and Jimmy, who were, you know, who very dear to me. And I'm very grateful for that.\\n\\n- I find, like in this photo there's something that's sort of the message that I tell young singers and stuff, that, the best singing or the best creating you'll ever do comes with ease. And it's relaxed and it's, it's in a moment that's not forced or stressed or, and I think this, this image sort of has that you know, it's, it's real.\\n\\n- Real.\\n\\n- But, you know, and, and if you if you find that peace when you, like, whether you're on stage or in a recording studio or in, in a photo.

The multi-panel photograph _The Shortest Day_ depicts a large-scale flower-wall, or floral constellation, within which the artist appears partially obscured by flora. Powerfully connecting the artist to nature and history, the work enacts a dynamic dialogue about identity alongside ideas of visibility and invisibility â€“ of being seen and unseen. Through his declarative self portraiture, Thompson takes control of how First Nations people are represented, dismantling the legacies of ethnographic photography. \\n\\nThis is the first work that Thompson made following the failed Voice referendum of October 2023. Rather than his usual vibrant living blooms, it is an abundance of dried botanical specimens that envelop the artist. The photograph is sombre and reflective, its stillness interrupted only by the billowing ribbons. Referencing the hot desert air that Thompson fondly remembers from his childhood, the ribbons here symbolise hope in moving forward.",

In _Hibiscus rosa sinensis_ the artist appears surrounded by lush foliage in close up, a bright red hibiscus protruding from her mouth. In traditional SÄmoan culture the hibiscus, when placed behind the ear, can signify relationship status and sexual availability. Behind the right means youâ€™re looking; behind the left means youâ€™re taken. In this video work, however, Tiatia creates a counternarrative. Challenging the stereotype of the sexually alluring â€˜dusky maidenâ€™, Tiatia stares steadily at the viewer and literally eats the myth. Tiatiaâ€™s consumption of this symbolically loaded bloom is an exercise in taking power back â€“ she situates herself as protagonist and rejects the colonial gaze.",

The multilingual singer/songwriter (she speaks English, Italian, French and Spanish) has released 21 albums and won six ARIA awards â€“ including being the first woman in ARIA history to win Album of the Year for _Donâ€™t Ask_ in 1995 â€“ a BRIT Award and two World Music Awards. Arena has also been recognised with a Member of the Order of Australia, a knighthood of the French National Order of Merit and induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame.\\n\\nGeorges Antoni is known for his dynamic yet sensitive compositions and his attentiveness to movement, shape and subtle tonal shifts. Presented as a diptych, Antoniâ€™s portrait of Arena honours her Italian heritage and evokes mid-20th-century European cinema. The work captures the grit and determination required to sustain her prolific and successful career in the global music industry. Offering a rare personal glimpse into the life of this much-loved Australian performer, the work expresses both vulnerability and strength, tenderness and fortitude.",

At 14 he was the youngest male dancer to be accepted into The Australian Ballet School; he went on to dance with The Australian Ballet, Englandâ€™s Royal Ballet and Les Ballets FÃ©lix Blaska in France. Over the years he has created productions for companies including Opera Australia, Shanghai Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. \\n\\nLewis Morley took this photograph during Murphyâ€™s first year as artistic director of The Dance Company (as the SDC was then known). Over four decades with the company, Murphy created a repertoire of more than 50 works. He explained his creative process during a 2020 conversation with David McAllister: â€˜It comes out of the deepest recesses of my subconscious, my movement, and if it doesnâ€™t relate, then I donâ€™t have a continuity within.â€™",

When interviewed in 2016 for _The Australian Ballet: The Ballet Men Issue_, Heathcote described the physicality of dance. â€˜One of the things I always loved was that pursuit of athleticism, pushing hard physicallyâ€™ he said. â€˜I really enjoyed roles like Romeo, because itâ€™s highly physical â€“ the partnering, but then also the sword-fighting and all that boy stuff. I used to love that.â€™",

                "transcript": "- If I had my choice when it comes to taking portraiture, I'd rather have 45 minutes of conversation, and then jam in 15 minutes of image making because that conversation or getting to know someone lowers the temperature in the room, trust becomes a thing, then I start to conjure up ideas, and particularly if I'm in a panic 'cause I generally am in a state of panic of how I'm gonna make an interesting image. Originally, I was going to be an illustrator. So that was something that I always, always planned to do. I was never gonna do anything different, I was obsessed with illustration. So I went all through my high school years, went to art school, lasted one year in a fine art degree, and then the dark room was a side project as part of my degree, and then I got stuck into the dark room. And was just the magic of the dark room and all of a sudden, that laboriousness of illustration versus the instant gratification of photography, and it filled a big hole, filled an artistic hole, and I just went this is what I'm gonna do. And then just fortuitously there was a little tiny little ad in the newspaper before phones and it said cadetship, dark room assistant at the Herald Newspaper, and I went well, I'm just gonna make a folly out of work and I'm just gonna turn up and I'm just gonna apply for this job, and I got this job as a cadetship which is now known as an internship. And then yeah, just sort of grew from that. Yeah, so that's how the photography, like that part started. I'm such a curious person about people, and stories, and mannerisms. So before I even pick up a camera, I think I like having a conversation. That's really strange. I like hearing them talk and I watch them, and without realising, I think I'm observing those little, quiet nuances in between the big gestures, and that's the stuff that I tend to hone in on. I don't know why. I know it sounds a bit weird but it's sort of like this little trance-y moment where I go from the person walks in the room, does that, sits down, introduces themself, and then starts to relax, and then do things, and then I latch onto that, and then I hone that. It's like a dance but I try and lead the dance, I give and take. And then once they're really comfortable with me, then I start to talk about what we might do as an image, but I never go in with preconceived ideas, I know that. I'm bad if I come up with an idea and walk in 'cause it's not gonna work. I rely on what they do in front of me, and that is a cue for me. I describe my work as quiet, and I think that I look for those little, quiet gestures in between the bigger gestures like if someone's quite verbose and quite a loud talker because either that's who they are or they're insecure, I wait for that to calm down, and then I start to infiltrate my little bit, and then I hone in on that part of their personality. I try to yeah, I'll throw all that stuff aside and just put everything into that little moment, that little, tiny nuance, the quiet, little moment, which is what I love. Yeah, so that's what I'm hunting for and it is chance. It always ends up being chance. I shoot with my digital camera and the first thing that people say to me is don't you need to check the back of your screen? And I go no, 'cause it'll just throw me off my game. 'Cause if I see too much, I start to doubt myself. I think I just like living in that dream scape of I don't know what I'm gonna get, and that was the great thing about film, was you wind it on, I don't know, I think it was good? Pull the dark slide, it looked good. So I think I had that innate trust because I was lucky enough to have been trained in film and trust what was gonna come out at the other end, that you were gonna get something from those 36 frames at some point, you only need one really great shot. Whereas digital, 2000, 3000, I can't ever ... I shoot digital like I shoot film. I think people think I'm lazy and I shoot and I'm taking pictures of people digitally and I go all right, we're done, they go is that it? And I go well, was that disappointing? And I go I'm sorry if I disappointed you but I'm happy! So I still shoot digital like I'm shooting film, like it's the war and I've gotta ration it. But for me, that's where I love photography, that's where I love it. That's like watching the print come up.",

Interviewed for _RealTime_ in 2017, Pippa described the role of dance in her work: â€˜dance allows me to capture things that are outside of myself and itâ€™s purely visual. Dance provided me a visual language for all those complex, inner emotional states of being human. It enabled me to express things that words canâ€™t and allows a level of empathy thatâ€™s otherwise difficult to find.â€™",

You know, it was a very different place for Aboriginal people in the 80s, but it was also a time when things were really starting to happen. I think what those photographs really demonstrate to me is a radical re-look at the way that Aboriginal people were being represented.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>I also look at every individual in the series â€“ all of them that I know, some of them that I am still very much in contact with â€“ and just think there was an alignment of the stars to bring us all together.</span>\\n\\n<span>Michael had an enormous influence on both my children. He was their uncle, and a connection between Michael and my children is very strong, so it's a very, very special photograph. And I remember Michael getting us to pose for that photograph. And I had no idea that it would become such an enduring image of the beauty that he could make.</span>\\n\\n<span>Brenda Croft:</span>\\n\\n<span>The image that day that he did with me and Dad... I can still remember that Dad's shirt had a big coffee stain on it, where he'd tipped his coffee on him. It didn't take very long. He just came in, took photographs. And I just, I love that image. You know, we used to go along to all the exhibitions that were on, around the traps. And Dad was there because he was friends with Ace, and Dad's, not bragging, but he was just really proud. And he was going 'Oh, you know, you've got to come to Michael's opening tomorrow night because you'll see an image ofÂ me and Brenda in it. Then Dad sort of wanders off somewhere and Michael's [under his breath] \"Brenda, Brenda, come 'ere, come 'ere\" and I went over and said \"What, what\" and he said 'I haven't printed it. What'll I do?\" And I just said, you know, \"Well if you want to make an old man happy, you'd better print it. So we did. We spent the entire night printing it in Sandy Edwards' studio, printing it by hand. So we framed it and and â€“ lucky for him â€“ Dad bought it at the opening.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>Darrell Sibosado:</span>\\n\\n<span>I actually love that image. For me, personally, it's one of the best photos I've seen of myself. It's the image that reflects me from that time, makes me think about it, you know, who I was at that time.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>So that day, I remember it was a bit organised. I kept saying yesterday I remember how disorganised Michael seemed. But this was a bit of a plan. But anyway, it was on the first floor, and we were in there, and it was quite simple. There was just him with a camera. He was so comfortable to be around. You know, even though he was quiet and everything, you knew it was a good quiet. It wasn't a quiet where he's thinking you're an idiot or anything like that. You know he's not thinking bad thoughts. And I just trusted him to do whatever he wants. So I just sat there and he took the photo and that's what came out.</span>",

In a 2015 interview with Kang Yena on _The INNERview_,Vernon said of working with dancers: â€˜Itâ€™s beautiful when you get a breakthrough. They own the movement really because no one else has done this. Itâ€™s just them and their body. I think once they can accept that, and start to feel more comfortable, itâ€™s a wonderful feeling as a dancer when you suddenly find a new way of moving, a new freedom, a new voice.â€™",

She first visited Australia on tour with the Ballets Russes in 1936, returning to Sydney two years later. In 1941 she established Kirsova Ballet, the first professional ballet company in Australia. In a 1940 _Sydney Morning Herald_ article about the opening of the school she said, â€˜there is plenty of talent here. There is also a great deal of appreciation for the ballet, and I think that appreciation can be intensified by greater knowledge of the tradition and meaning of balletâ€™. Kirsova created original ballets and was an important patron of Australian composers, set designers, artists and photographers. A similar photograph of Kirsova featuring the shadows of a rope pulley backstage, also by Dupain, as published in _The Home_ magazine in 1938.",

In an article by Steven Dow for _The Guardian_ in 2021, Rings said of Lawford-Wolf, â€˜She was so proud of her country; she loved her country â€¦ She was naturally gifted.

And I wanted to write a theatre that was different, had all different forms of acting in it whether it be music, dance, singing, a monologue. And I wanted to stay in the traditional way of storytelling but make it real, make it different. And the only way, and the only way I can do stories like that was to fall back on myself and my plays, like â€˜You know, youâ€™ve got a story yourself, youâ€™ve been to Alaska when you were 16, you know, you lived here, you lived there, youâ€™ve come from Christmas Creek station, youâ€™ve come up from nowhere and make a name for yourself in the acting world and that is an achievement for someone my age. And I never really thought about it because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m anything special. I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m still quite naive in that aspect.\\n\\nI wanted to make it honest too, â€˜cos you look at a lot of Aboriginal people that are working out there, thereâ€™s a lot of Aboriginal women that are working but not really strong Aboriginal womenâ€™s stories. And I wanted to make my point of view as a woman and as a proud Aboriginal woman, proud of where I come from, whether than be the backblocks of Woop Woop but yet that place still has a very big significance for me. I wanted to make Australia realise that they do have an Indigenous culture in Australia. They have it here. No, no, and Australia doesnâ€™t need to go anywhere else and adopt someone elseâ€™s Indigenous culture which a lot of people tend to do. But, you know, they have it here. And nobody hasnâ€™t discovered it, itâ€™s so funny going to Europe, for me, and more European people know more about Aboriginal Australia than Australians do so which is quite sad, which is really really quite sad. It goes to show how ignorant white Australia is.",

During that tour she was elated when ballet critic Arnold Haskell, writing for Melbourneâ€™s _Table Talk_, described her performance as â€˜brilliantâ€™, noting her â€˜aristocratically energetic movementâ€™. Tchinarova remained in Sydney after a second tour with Covent Garden Russian Ballet in 1938.

As Kitcher reflected in his 2001 book _From Gaolbird to Lyrebird_: â€˜An infusion of excitement, apprehension and nerves spread through the new company as we awaited the arrival of Robert Helpmann â€¦ His formidable authority and flamboyant personality were legendary.â€™  \\n\\n\\nThis photographic montage resulted from David Mooreâ€™s short sitting with Helpmann in his Sydney hotel room in 1969.

Markova then decided to leave and start her own company with Anton Dolin. And I thought, â€˜Well this is the end of the balletâ€™, when Ninette de Valois said, â€˜Iâ€™ve found a girl that youâ€™re going to dance withâ€™, and took me into the classroom and I said, â€˜Which one?â€™ She said, â€˜That one over there with the two long plaitsâ€™, and I thought, â€˜That funny-looking little girl?â€™ and I said, â€˜Whatâ€™s her name?â€™ and she said, â€˜Peggy Hookhamâ€™, and I said, â€˜Well, thatâ€™s not going to look very good on the notice board is it, Peggy Hookham?â€™ And I said, â€˜She looks Chineseâ€™. And she said, â€˜Well as a matter of fact, she was born in Shanghai but she is English. No, she was born in Reigate and she went to Shanghai as a little girl â€“ I want you to work with herâ€™. And the minute, of course, I saw her dance, I realised that she was absolutely wonderful, and Ninette said, â€˜Sheâ€™s going to change her name, sheâ€™s going to call herself Margot Fonteynâ€™. And so from that moment on, I danced with Fonteyn for 27 years and I suppose we became, at that time, the most famous pair dancing in Europe.\\n\\nIâ€™m always asked what was the most memorable performance or production, and itâ€™s impossible really for me to say, because so many things have been memorable to me. My first appearances with Markova, my first appearances with Fonteyn, my first appearances with Vivienne Leigh, the first time I played _Hamlet_, all of them. I have never felt for one minute in my life, â€˜Iâ€™m a successâ€™. I feel Iâ€™ve accomplished something and that is done and therefore there is something more to do. The success or failure of what has passed has passed and I must go on to something else. And whatever else I may have achieved in life, I hope that people will remember that my whole life has been dedicated to producing something of beauty in the theatre.",

The first Australian label to be included in one of New Yorkâ€™s Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute exhibitions, Romance Was Born have dressed high-profile people including BjÃ¶rk, Miley Cyrus, Caroline Kennedy and Cate Blanchett.\\n\\nThis portrait defies the limits of a singular photographic moment. Artist Samuel Hodge, a long-time collaborator of the pair, mined his personal archive to create this dual portrait that celebrates the 20-year anniversary of the brand. Deftly combining hundreds of photographs of the designers and their collections â€“ from candid moments to backstage preparation and official campaigns â€“ Hodgeâ€™s portrait is both intimate and expansive. Paying tribute to the dynamism, playfulness, vitality and chaos of creative practice, each photograph amassed in this work offers us a glimpse into the world of Romance Was Born but also Plunkett and Sales as people. From afar, these image fragments appear like luminous gemstones â€“ a nod to the splendid, riotous colour that defines Romance Was Bornâ€™s designs.",

Working primarily in photography, video and textiles, Atem explores migrant narratives and postcolonial practices in the African diaspora, the relationship between public and private spaces, and the exploration of home and identity through portraiture.\\n\\nAtemâ€™s family emigrated to NSWâ€™s Central Coast from South Sudan in 1997 when she was six years old. Living in Melbourne since 2014, Atemâ€™s work speaks to her sense of belonging and connection to her community in Australia and beyond.\\n\\nIn her portraits, in which she often depicts herself, Atem pushes against the impact of ethnographic photography and the images that defined representation from the 19th century onwards. Instead, Atong looks to the studio portraiture of mid-20th-century African photographers such as Malick SidibÃ© and Seydou KeÃ¯ta, for whom the medium provided a powerful means of resistance.\\n\\nReferencing these photographersâ€™ dynamic and vibrant compositions, as well as South Sudanese Dinka culture, Atem extends a lineage of photographic work that celebrated their subjects and returned agency to them. As she has said, â€˜Iâ€™m interested in the moment in history when black people took the camera and chose to photograph ourselves for ourselvesâ€™.",

                "transcript": "Yeah, I think I've got a really strong interest in, I suppose, non-Western ways of keeping history and recording history because that's what I've grown up with. So as a South Sudanese person, a Dinka person, we have a tradition of writing songs to tell stories. And beyond that, also a lot of our names are sort of ways to record history as well. My name Atong means like war, or it references war, because I was born during a time of war. And other people's names reference whatever kind of period that they were born in. So, there's this interesting thing where for me, culturally, history has always been embodied and has always been a participatory thing rather than, I don't know, something that happens after the fact. It's not about, say, if you get to write it, you get to sort of change it or whatever. It's more along the lines of just by existing, by having a name, by participating in a family, you are part of history, and your participation in that history will always be recorded.\\n\\nSo my interest is, like you know, how do I continue that history through my own photographic practice and arts practice. There's sort of for me an interest in figuring out how to combine the visual language of photography with the oral language of record-keeping in a Dinka tradition.\\n\\nI think for me as someone who uses primarily digital photography, it can often feel like the photographic object is separate to the practice of making photographic works because they can just sort of exist in the digital realm. But there is also for me such an importance to the printed photograph and that as a sculpture in its own right.\\n\\nI'm trying to think of ways to engage with that object outside of printing, framing, hanging. Because my relationship to photography or my relationship to photos, I should say, is photo albums. These objects that require participation and these objects that kind of have an emotional weight as well as a physical weight. And, you know, are designed to sort of exist as objects, and I find that really important and fascinating.",

Cave formed his first band, eventually named The Boys Next Door, when he was a student. After leaving school the band became embedded in Melbourneâ€™s post-punk and alternative music scenes, renaming themselves The Birthday Party when they relocated to London. Based on photos, posters and clippings, this portrait was made in Arkleyâ€™s Melbourne studio in 1999, when Cave was the frontman for Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. The result is a portrait that evokes the material culture of the underground music scene, as well as the emotional intensity of Caveâ€™s writing and music. Its pulsating colour coveys the noise and lurid stage lighting of the venues where Cave made his start. It is an unmistakeable example of Arkleyâ€™s work and a distillation of the many stylistic and technical threads that run through it â€“ from the abstract compositions of his early career to the airbrush paintings of suburban homes and interiors for which he is best known.",

Acrylic paint on stretched canvas, unframed, measuring 175cm high and 135cm wide.\\n\\nThe image undulates with flowing lines that define the contours of his face, creating organic shapes. It is painted in clashing colours that pulse alongside one another, creating a fluid yet graphic quality. The edges of these shapes are hazy having been outlined with an airbrush. The background is revealed in the lower left corner and is painted a matt teal.\\n\\nHis face fills the canvas and is cropped at the neck. His head is turned towards us with his left ear visible, the right ear remaining out of view. \\n\\nHis hair, cut off by the edge of the painting is disheveled and wavy. The tendrils of hair are reminiscent of seaweed and painted in thick locks of different shades of blue and purple, outlined in deep indigo. It tumbles down surrounding his long face, tucked behind his left ear and curling at the ends to rest around his neck. \\n\\nThe shape of his face is described in five solid colours that are painted in a combination of competing cool and warm tones. His forehead and cheekbone are the highest points, painted white, with the lower planes of his face shaded in purple and a deep fuchsia with peach and neon yellow in between. His left ear is painted in the same manner, highlighted in pops of the same colours. \\n\\nDeep-set eyes are shadowed in purple and fuchsia, exaggerating and defining the eye sockets. A crescent stroke of deep blue is painted beneath both eyes. The exception to the indistinct airbrushed lines is a source of light reflected in the iris of both eyes, detailed by sharp edged white marks. These hard edges draw attention, enhancing the intensity of his aloof gaze that conflicts with the brightness of the painting.\\n\\nHis nose sweeps down from his right eye in curling lines and shapes of peach, white and pink. A shadow beneath his nose connects to his top lip. His mouth is closed in a resting position with pouty pink lips. \\n\\nHis curved jawline casts a shadow onto his creamy white neck. The contrast of his stark neck against his vivid face give the impression he is wearing a mask, adding a sense of theatre and glamour to the work.",

In her portrait of violinist, conductor and composer Richard Tognetti AO (b. 1965), her subject appears to float in an abstract field of colour. As Hearman noted of the portrait: â€˜How do you condense a brilliant frenetic being, who unfolds in time, into a single image that exists in the present? Richard is a field of energy and I have tried to nail down particles that look like they belong to him.â€™ Tognetti trained with famed violinists William Primrose and Alice Waten in Australia before undertaking further studies with Igor Ozim at the Bern Conservatory in Switzerland, where he was awarded the Tschumi Prize for outstanding graduate soloist. He returned home in 1989 to lead the Australian Chamber Orchestra and was appointed the Artistic Director and Lead Violin later that year. As director or soloist, Tognetti has appeared with many of the worldâ€™s leading orchestras, and has co-composed scores for feature films, notably Peter Weirâ€™s 2003 _Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World_ (for which he also coached Russell Crowe for his onscreen violin playing).",

With a background in advertising and journalism, and a reputation as an uncompromising food critic (he established the Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide in 1984) he was the director of the Melbourne Festival from 1994 to 1996 and the Sydney Festival from 1997 to 2001. In the latter role, he was credited with making the annual showcase for music, dance, theatre, art and outdoor events more diverse, accessible and financially viable. From 1996 to 2000 he was the inaugural chairman of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra; in 2001 he directed the Olympic Arts Festival; and in 2002-2003 he directed the Sydney New Yearâ€™s Eve celebrations. A prominent commentator on museums and heritage issues, he painstakingly restored Sydneyâ€™s historic Bronte House during his tenancy there, and later revivified a historic house in Kempton, Tasmania. \\n\\nBrent Harris is a Melbourne-based painter and printmaker. In some of Harrisâ€™s abstract work, inaugural National Portrait Gallery Director Andrew Sayers noticed circular forms that were faintly suggestive of portraiture. Having been persuaded to undertake the commission, which came as a considerable surprise, Harris finished two different paintings of Schofield, and invited the Gallery to choose between them. In one, Schofield was pictured under a flowering wisteria. In the other â€“ this one â€“ the oval frame around Schofieldâ€™s sparely rendered, yet unmistakable face seemed to reflect his interest in colonial art.",

His work as an advertising copywriter influenced his early poetry, lucidly evoking the culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s. British poet Stephen Spender described Porter's mind as 'immensely fertile, lively, informed, honest and penetrating'. Porter's first collection of poems, _Once Bitten, Twice Bitten_, was published in Britain in 1961. The death of his wife in 1974 gave rise to the poetry collection _The Cost of Seriousness_ (1978). Porter's straddling of Australian and English culture remained central to his work, evoking urban and natural worlds. In 1990 Porter was awarded the Gold Medal of Australian Literature, and in 2002, the Queenâ€™s Gold Medal for Poetry.\\n\\nBest known for his landscapes, Tony Clark's work features conceptual, punk and pop qualities, as evidenced by the reduced palette of blue and pink in this portrait of Porter. The blue of Porter's floating head references Clark's preoccupation with the classicism of Josiah Wedgwood's Jasperware.",

However, the thing which is most interesting to me about the process of writing is what particularly moves you to write on a, say, a theme or a particular purpose. Well, with me itâ€™s rather like something sticking into me, something will get into my mind, and since I observe this much of a method that I have a set of notebooks which I work in, Iâ€™m usually working in, say, four notebooks at once and approaching from one end and from the other end, moving towards the middle, so that I have sort of places where I am working, like a workshop, like a sculptor might have his workshop where he has still got a piece, say, unfinished which he is working on. I have poems which are in unfinished states, which I keep going back to, and every time I get an idea for a poem I just put it in a margin and return to it. The one thing I do believe in is often choosing deliberately a particular external form before you actually choose your poem, though over the years Iâ€™ve tended to write more free verse poems, but I still like returning to poems in set forms and recently Iâ€™ve been writing a whole batch of sonnets.\\n\\nI also try to use different forms and to attempt things which I havenâ€™t done before, but mostly itâ€™s ideas, I suppose. Iâ€™m probably an impure poet, I believe in impure poetry, Iâ€™m not interested in lyrical qualities for themselves. What interests me in poetry is the confrontation of certain sorts of language, and therefore I like to be able to use many different styles, many different ways of doing things. I neither like to be particularly modern nor particularly traditional. In my view, the best poets are those who, starting from a traditional basis, widen the language by their own imagination.",

The figure of Alice was inspired by his wife, poet, writer and philanthropist Barbara Blackman AO (1928â€“2024). Just 15 when the ABC Weekly published one of her poems, Barbara became a member of Brisbaneâ€™s literary circle, joining the Barjai writersâ€™ collective where she met the poet Judith Wright (1915â€“2000), who she is depicted with here. Wright had been experiencing hearing loss since her midtwenties, while Barbara had begun to lose her sight and was declared blind by the age of 22. Barbara later wrote: â€˜She of the faraway voice and I of the faraway face did not find our lacks obstructive to the deepening roots of friendship.â€™ This double portrait dates from a period in Charles Blackmanâ€™s career when he had to economise on materials, and is executed in thin layers of oil paint, leaving the paper bare on the faces and skin. Barbara, in profile at the right-hand side of the composition, recalled that the hat she is shown wearing belonged to Wright. Her hand is spread protectively over her friendâ€™s ear.",

                "transcript": "It was in many ways a very unlikely marriage, for a person near-blind or going blind to marry someone whose whole world was a visual world and who was so creative in that visual world. But somehow what his creations came out of â€“ a sort of a living or understanding of poetry â€“ was something that always bound us and still binds us together. But at that time when I recognised Charles as potentially a very great painter and a great creator, I relinquished my strong intentions of being a writer and although I went on writing diaries and sometimes poems and more and more I became a very prolific letter-writer as I gathered more and more interesting people as friends and we became more and more separated by distance, my writing changed course, as in fact my life had changed course to become devoted to Charlesâ€™ optimal putting forward of himself as a painter.\\n\\nYou know, when we married I said, â€˜Well if youâ€™re going to be a painter, youâ€™re going to paint, youâ€™re not going to go out and get a job doing something or another,â€™ so he stayed home and painted. And by this time my eyesight had failed almost altogether and I was on a blind pension, so we had that as a basis to live on. And the only thing I could really do was to work as an artistâ€™s model, as a nude model, which in fact I quite enjoyed because I was picking up a lot of information about painting. Itâ€™s quite an elegant job in its way, being a model, because one can decide oneâ€™s own poses and itâ€™s a very private occupation. One can have oneâ€™s own thoughts and one has the satisfaction of knowing oneâ€™s doing a job well.",

                "transcript": "The portrait shows Judith Wright; poet, literary critic, editor, and fiction writer, with her friend Barbara Blackman; poet, writer, and philanthropist. The portrait is oriented horizontally, and measures approximately 115cm tall by 150cm wide including its unusual 10 cm frame. This is a complex work of bright colours, unusual shapes and bold textures\\n\\nThe wooden frame is like a series of concentric frames within frames, of varying widths and colours, painted to resemble different metals. On the outermost edge of the frame antique gold-leaf that has darkened and rubbed off in patches. Inside this, a wide band, painted green like the patina on weathered copper. The next band is narrower, the distressed, gold-leaf pattern is repeated. The band of frame closest to the painting is very thin and gleams pink like polished copper.\\n\\nThe background of the portrait is sky-blue. Judith and Barbaraâ€™s heads and torsos fill most of the space. The womenâ€™s faces are in profile, Judith on the left, Barbara on the right. The friends are connected by their gaze as they look at each other, their arms which reach across, and their upper bodies that seem to merge towards the bottom of the portrait. \\n\\nThe figures are not â€˜life likeâ€™. Judith and Barbaraâ€™s silhouetted profiles are simplified and exaggerated in an almost cartoon like way. This simplicity, the defined line between their forms, together with the blue background gives the women the quality of collage paper cut-outs.\\n\\nA limited colour palette of blue, red, yellow, white, and black has been chosen, and is blended in places to create green, purple, lighter and darker shades., Paint has been applied unevenly, with some thick streaks of colour, some areas washed with diluted colour, and other patches of the brown paper left bare.\\n\\nJudith is slightly shorter. Her face turns towards her friend. Judithâ€™s silhouette is simplified and geometric. A tall rectangle with triangular nose jutting out. She has a cropped red fringe, her eye, which slants down at the outer edge and seems to look up towards her friend, is a red outline and smudges of blue on the eyelids and iris. Judithâ€™s cheek is a pink blur and the rest of her skin is the warm beige of the paper. Her cheek has been accentuated by a patch of translucent white. Judithâ€™s lips have a purple-grey hue, and turn down, following the same angle as her eye. The rest of her hair - in blue, green, and red - falls straight down, ending in a blunt line level with her chin. Her hair is irregular vertical dashes, except at the ends, which are round dabs. Barbaraâ€™s large hand protectively cups the back of Judithâ€™s head with her splayed fingers.\\n\\nJudithâ€™s torso faces forward. She is wearing a V-neck, sleeveless garment in blue-grey, on it, thick brush strokes roughly repeat itâ€™s shape getting smaller and smaller. Judithâ€™s left hand is emerging to clasp Barbaraâ€™s left shoulder. \\n\\nBetween the two figures the women seem to merge; at Judithâ€™s forehead and Barbaraâ€™s hat brim; where Barbaraâ€™s arm extends out and across to her friend, and at the bottom where their bodies blend together, shoulder to breast. Blue space between them is emphasised by darker shading around the womenâ€™s profiles.\\n\\nBarbara Blackman wears a hat with a low crown and wide brim, it casts a shadow over her brow. Barbaraâ€™s hair falls straight then flicks out slightly where it ends in line with her bottom lip. The shape of her hair is outlined in feathery black- blue brush strokes and filled in with soft, vertical smudges of deep-blue, rust-red, pale-blue and yellow. \\n\\nThe women are both in profile, Barbaraâ€™s head is wider at her forehead than her chin. Her broad nose extends down in a vertical line from her hat brim, her chin receding. Her eye, which meets Judithâ€™s, has its upper eyelid delineated in black; a dark black and blue iris, a thick blue smudge for the lower lid. Her skin is a faint white, over the raw paper and there is a tinge of pink on her cheek. Her lips are two lines of rich red that turn up gently at the edge.\\n\\nBarbara wears a light grey, round-necked, long sleeved garment. Her body turns towards Judith as the friends embrace.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

After ten injury-plagued seasons he retired from playing to become an assistant coach. He was appointed senior coach of the Melbourne Demons in 1998, guiding the club to the Grand Final against Essendon in 2000. He retired from coaching in 2007. Diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) in 2013, Daniher co-founded the organisation FightMND 'to take the fight right up to it'. He has since become the face of The Big Freeze, a fundraising event held annually when Melbourne play Collingwood at the MCG. Daniher was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2021 for his work with FightMND, which to date has raised over $50 million for research into treatments for the disease.\\n\\nMichael Peck formed his idea for this portrait after reading Daniher's memoir, in which he calls MND 'The Beast': 'an ugly piece of gear, hairy and dark, like a huge hybrid of a blowfly and a moth'. Peck depicted Daniher wearing a FightMND beanie, and Daniher wanted the portrait to show his arms, as they are where his condition is most evident. 'It was not comfortable for Neale to sit like this,' Peck says, 'but he was determined to capture the right image. This alone is testament to his strength and determination.'",

                "transcript": "- Neale's a Melbourne icon. I guess his career in football was legendary. And then, I guess the things he's done for the research and raising funds to fight motor neurone disease has been incredible. I think he took his profile and used that as a way to be able to do something really, really outstanding. Normally, if I'm painting a portrait, normally I meet and have a conversation and sort of think about that conversation and try and research the person a little bit before I try to really settle with what the concept's gonna be. When I first met Neale, I was able to go to his house and meet with his wife, Jan, and himself. He refers to motor neurone disease as the beast. You know, he refers to it as this ugly, terrible thing. You know, I think he, the way he explains it, it's halfway between a blowfly and a moth, and he said that that's the ugliest thing that he can possibly think of. I thought the idea of actually trying to portray that through trying to create visually what that looked like would be an important part of the painting. At the start, I said, \"Do you want your arms to be in the painting?\" And he said they have to be in the painting because they show the disease. In the image, he's sitting with his arms crossed in front of him, and for him to have his arms like that, Jan would put them up onto the plinth that we had in front of him. Yeah, he really wanted that because this painting had to be about his fight with motor neurone disease. And, although his arms are like that, he wanted them there, but he wanted to really be able to sit upright, look directly at the camera. And there's a really, something about his focus in the painting in those initial photographs was just dead on. It was sort of like, I'm gonna take this on. And yeah, I thought that was quite powerful. I've always made art. My mum always had art materials around the house. She'd go off and do art classes and bring home these, you know, the life drawings and the still lifes, and things that she was working on, and because the materials were there, and I'd always look at it and go, oh, I love that paper. I love that, you know, the chalk or the charcoal that she's working with, and I'd sort of just pick them up and start drawing. But no one ever sort of said, oh, you should do this. It was just something that I did. And I would sit there and I'd draw for hours and just love it. And that love of art has just always continued from an early age, you know, to now. It's gonna be there for the rest of my life, I think. I always wanna make sure that the sitter, it's gonna be an accurate depiction of who they are, and that I'm not saying something that's not true. And then, normally, I would work out, like, we'd do a photo shoot. I'd work from a series of images and actually create kind of like an aggregate of those images. I work from that, and then once I'm happy with that image, when it starts to feel right, that's when I start painting, and I go from that image. And I normally, I stick pretty closely to what that image is. And then, as I'm going, I might fine tune in the paint, you know, the contrast between light and dark or whether something needs to have less detail or more detail, you know. A lot of that comes out in the paints. I mean, my paintings end up looking a lot like photographs, but they need to be a heightened version of that. They can't just be a photograph. And also that's to do with my relationship with the painting. I need to be making decisions as I go so that I can love that process of paint. I've been interested in realism for forever. I mean, I wouldn't know to call it that when I was a kid, but, you know, the idea of taking something and trying to focus on the detail and pull things out, which make it, you know, which start to make the painting really, or the drawing, really stand out has always been something that I've loved. You know, when I was a kid, I used to draw the mountains and draw things from postcards or find things in the \"National Geographic\" and draw them. And then, as I started to realise that, you know, the images in the artworks can start to convey meaning, and you can tell the story and the narrative, I guess I started to really think about what I was putting into the images, how I would juxtapose one thing against another and it could start to tell a story. And also, that viewers could interpret those images in different ways, whether it was a way that I wanted them to read it, or whether it was a way that they could interpret it. So I always thought if someone can interpret an image differently than the way that I intend it to be, I always think that's a really nice thing to happen.",

--> 00:02:14.190\\nI've always made art.\\n\\n48\\n00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.950\\nMy mum always had art materials around the house.\\n\\n49\\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.480\\nShe'd go off and do art classes\\n\\n50\\n00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.090\\nand bring home these, you know, the life drawings\\n\\n51\\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.599\\nand the still lifes, and things that she was working on,\\n\\n52\\n00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.250\\nand because the materials were there,\\n\\n53\\n00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.500\\nand I'd always look at it and go, oh, I love that paper.\\n\\n54\\n00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.510\\nI love that, you know, the chalk\\n\\n55\\n00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.480\\nor the charcoal that she's working with,\\n\\n56\\n00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.870\\nand I'd sort of just pick them up and start drawing.\\n\\n57\\n00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.150\\nBut no one ever sort of said, oh, you should do this.\\n\\n58\\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.380\\nIt was just something that I did.\\n\\n59\\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.430\\nAnd I would sit there\\n\\n60\\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.470\\nand I'd draw for hours and just love it.\\n\\n61\\n00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.990\\nAnd that love of art has just always continued\\n\\n62\\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.140\\nfrom an early age, you know, to now.\\n\\n63\\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.790\\nIt's gonna be there for the rest of my life, I think.\\n\\n64\\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.400\\nI always wanna make sure that the sitter,\\n\\n65\\n00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.790\\nit's gonna be an accurate depiction of who they are,\\n\\n66\\n00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.570\\nand that I'm not saying something that's not true.\\n\\n67\\n00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.120\\nAnd then, normally, I would work out,\\n\\n68\\n00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.980\\nlike, we'd do a photo shoot.\\n\\n69\\n00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.370\\nI'd work from a series of images\\n\\n70\\n00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.720\\nand actually create kind of like\\n\\n71\\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.510\\nan aggregate of those images.\\n\\n72\\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.240\\nI work from that, and then once I'm happy with that image,\\n\\n73\\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.530\\nwhen it starts to feel right, that's when I start painting,\\n\\n74\\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.700\\nand I go from that image.\\n\\n75\\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.650\\nAnd I normally, I stick pretty closely\\n\\n76\\n00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.390\\nto what that image is.\\n\\n77\\n00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.410\\nAnd then, as I'm going, I might fine tune in the paint,\\n\\n78\\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.287\\nyou know, the contrast between light and dark\\n\\n79\\n00:03:33.287 --> 00:03:36.780\\nor whether something needs to have less detail\\n\\n80\\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.160\\nor more detail, you know.\\n\\n81\\n00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.060\\nA lot of that comes out in the paints.\\n\\n82\\n00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.950\\nI mean, my paintings end up looking\\n\\n83\\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.440\\na lot like photographs,\\n\\n84\\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.530\\nbut they need to be a heightened version of that.\\n\\n85\\n00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.810\\nThey can't just be a photograph.\\n\\n86\\n00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.640\\nAnd also that's to do with my relationship\\n\\n87\\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.810\\nwith the painting.\\n\\n88\\n00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.710\\nI need to be making decisions as I go\\n\\n89\\n00:03:58.095 --> 00:04:00.145\\nso that I can love that process of paint.\\n\\n90\\n00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.520\\nI've been interested in realism for forever.\\n\\n91\\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.610\\nI mean, I wouldn't know to call it that when I was a kid,\\n\\n92\\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.650\\nbut, you know, the idea of taking something\\n\\n93\\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.620\\nand trying to focus on the detail and pull things out,\\n\\n94\\n00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.750\\nwhich make it, you know,\\n\\n95\\n00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.780\\nwhich start to make the painting really,\\n\\n96\\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.800\\nor the drawing, really stand\\n\\n97\\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.170\\nout has always been something that I've loved.\\n\\n98\\n00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.003\\nYou know, when I was a kid,\\n\\n99\\n00:04:26.003 --> 00:04:28.800\\nI used to draw the mountains and draw things from postcards\\n\\n100\\n00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.680\\nor find things in the \"National Geographic\" and draw them.\\n\\n101\\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.850\\nAnd then, as I started to realise that, you know,\\n\\n102\\n00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.400\\nthe images in the artworks can start to convey meaning,\\n\\n103\\n00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.310\\nand you can tell the story and the narrative,\\n\\n104\\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.380\\nI guess I started to really think\\n\\n105\\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.120\\nabout what I was putting into the images,\\n\\n106\\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.370\\nhow I would juxtapose one thing against another\\n\\n107\\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.100\\nand it could start to tell a story.\\n\\n108\\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.320\\nAnd also, that viewers could interpret\\n\\n109\\n00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.970\\nthose images in different ways,\\n\\n110\\n00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.760\\nwhether it was a way that I wanted them to read it,\\n\\n111\\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.430\\nor whether it was a way that they could interpret it.\\n\\n112\\n00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.020\\nSo I always thought if someone can interpret\\n\\n113\\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.070\\nan image differently than the way that I intend it to be,\\n\\n114\\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.063\\nI always think that's a really nice thing to happen.\\n\\n",

Having achieved great success in this field â€“ he won a Cannes Gold Lion in 1967 â€“ he gave it up to paint full-time in 1980, working from a 'cabin' below his home on Sydney Harbour. Soon, his stylised, colourful representations of Sydney's beaches, harbour, animals and flowers found their way onto placemats, t-shirts, swimwear, bedlinen, mugs and vases; in the 1990s, the walls, ceiling and some furniture in the Garden Restaurant at the Powerhouse Museum were covered with murals by the artist. His crucial role in promoting Sydney as a tourist destination, particularly in Japan, is now widely acknowledged. Until this self portrait was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery, no major Australian art museum held an example of his work. His memoir _Ken Done: A life coloured in_ was published in 2016 and his _Ken Done: Paintings you probably haven't seen_ in 2017.",

                "transcript": "A self portrait of the artist Ken Done created in 1992. Oil and synthetic polymer paint on canvas measures 102 centimetres high and 76 centimetres wide.\\n\\nThe frame is painted a matte black with a floral and leaf design loosely scratched into the surface. The inner border of the frame is a darkened gold.\\n\\nThe background and figure are a patchwork of clashing colours and patterns. The surface is heavily textured, with brush marks evident and some short hairs from the paint brush caught in the paint. Ken Doneâ€™s face fills the frame; the top of his head, edges of his ears and base of neck, reach the outer edges of the canvas.\\n\\nA line of thick black paint arcs across the top of his head. His face is divided into shapes, with his forehead painted red with yellow dots on the left side and cobalt blue on the right side, with a stylised white outline of the Sydney Harbour Bridge floating on top. The rest of his face is painted in zones of pink, forest green and blues. A patch of black with yellow stripes features under the left eye. A simplified outline of the Sydney Opera House is painted in white, filled in with blue on the right cheek.\\n\\nHe has painted himself with three non-matching eyes; the left eye, pink and blue with a yellow pupil, the right eye, yellow with a black pupil and a central eye, blue with a yellow pupil outlined in yellow. He has merged a profile face with a full-face representation, reminiscent of a cubist style of painting. Thick yellow paint outlines the yellow eye, eyebrow and side profile of a nose and mouth with a flash of white teeth. This profile sits on top of the right side of the full-face view. The frontal representation is more dominant with the eyes rimmed in black, a black moustache and exaggerated red banana-shaped smile. His neck brings together strong brush strokes of purple, orange, red, black and blue. \\n\\nThe top half of the background is painted a cobalt blue with the word â€˜meâ€™ painted in yellow block letters in the top left corner. The lower section of the canvas is coloured orange on the left side of his neck and has sections of mottled tones of turquoise, burgundy and green and a patch of yellow with irregular red dots on the right.  \\nThe artist initials, â€˜KDâ€™ are roughly painted in red in the lower right-hand corner. \\n\\nAudio description written by Alana Sivell and voiced by Molly Desmond.",

I'm not complaining, but I've had to overcome a lot of early success in the sense that the early things that people saw were very commercial things. I was 40 when I had my first exhibition. It's quite old, really. But, that's just the way it was for me.\\n\\nIf you like visual things, you know, that's what you like, you like all kinds of things and the only criteria should be, was it any good? You know, do you like it? I am very Sydney. I live beside Sydney Harbour which is a fantastic place to be. I kayak on the harbour, I feed the fish, I don't like to catch them anymore. I feed them, in fact, if anybody comes down here and they say, is there any fish around? I say, oh, no, there's no fish around here. No fish around here. But of course there are, top of the tide, there's eight big bream, I almost know them by name, come around each morning. There's parts of the harbour close by here, where we live, that hasn't changed forever. No houses, look exactly the same as when aboriginal people lived here or even later when Captain Cook came through. That's one of the great things about Sydney, I think, is that they've still preserved that natural landscape in some parts. Such a beautiful place. Almost inevitably you'll make pictures that try to be beautiful. You can't be as beautiful as itself, you can never be as beautiful as nature, you can not. But all you can do is to use that environment to lead you to make a painting that somehow might have the feeling of it.\\n\\nIt's a complicated picture and it clearly set out to show that there's a kind of public face that I have. That's most of the time smiling and most of the time optimistic. But there's another face, maybe another even two faces within there that I hope shows a sadder side or a different kind of sensitivity. Glenn designed a house for us. We've known him a long time, he's a lovely man. And I did make a small drawing, but I wanted to make the painting as simple and as elegant as one of his buildings. I love the fact that in the portrait gallery, you've sometimes shown them both together and it just shows his elegant simplicity against the kind of complication of my self portrait which, you know, I would say straight to the psychiatrist, looking at that painting.",

optimistic.\\n\\n49\\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.841\\nBut there's another face,\\n\\n50\\n00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:31.074\\nmaybe another even two faces within there\\n\\n51\\n00:02:31.074 -->

Her first novel, the semi-autobiographical _Monkey Grip_ (1977), won a National Book Council Award and was made into a film released in 1982. _Honour and Other People's Children_ (1980), _Postcards from Surfers_ (1985), _The Children's Bach_ (1984), _Cosmo Cosmolin_o (1992), _True Stories_ (1997) and _The Feel of Steel_ (2001) followed. Since the 1990s Garner has pursued a variety of ethical questions in journal articles and non-fiction books. In 1993 she won a Walkley Award for her _Time_ magazine article about Daniel Valerio, a two-year-old who died of abuse inflicted by his mother's boyfriend. Two years later her book _The First Stone_, exploring claims of sexual harassment at Melbourne University, caused a sensation. Her rumination on the murder of a Canberra student, _Joe Cinque's Consolation_, was published in 2004 and made into a film in 2016. \\n\\nFor this portrait, artist Jenny Sages created a series of oil sketches before laying down the fundamental elements in wax and red pigment. 'Then, with my heart in my mouth, I dipped my fingers into the wax medium and then into the pigment. Using my fingers as a brush, I just hoped for the best â€¦' The work glows with the light of the studio and reflects the warm relationship between the women.",

Iâ€™ve lost people who were acquaintances, or people who â€¦ And people who â€¦ real friends whoâ€™ve seen themselves in my books have taken it on the chin, you know, in a very remarkable way.\\n\\nI mean there is a characterâ€¦ there is a person on whom the character of Javo is based. You could imagine that perhaps such a personâ€™s life might have been altered in some way by the publication â€“ well not the publication of the book but by the bookâ€™s success and by the amount of publicity that itâ€™s had. He seems to me to be such a trouper about it. We very rarely see each other, but â€¦ heâ€™s in America but he came to see me a few weeks ago, the day before he left for America, I hadnâ€™t seen him for a long time, I hadnâ€™t seen him since before the film was made, and he hadnâ€™t seen the film. But he came for a visit and we just sat around, talked, had a cup of coffee, talked of what work he was doing, and this and that. And then one of us mentioned the name Monkey Grip and we both just burst out laughing. It was very encouraging and heartening because I realised that he didnâ€™t hold anything against me, and, rather the opposite, I think he rather liked the book. And he co-operated with the director of the film, he gave a lot of help to Ken Cameron in the making of the film, which I really loved him for and admired him for.\\n\\nAnd I think that this question of the autobiographical element or the biographical element in fiction, where people see themselves represented, or misrepresented in their view, by a fiction writer, itâ€™s a very difficult matter, particularly in womenâ€™s writing I think. Because women do tend, at least at this point in history, to write from very close to themselves. So itâ€™s always going to be a problem and I think itâ€™ll continue to be a problem for me. And I donâ€™t regret anything Iâ€™ve written.",

                "transcript": "Becoming a painter takes a... I mean it's a hell of a journey. I started off by drawing people, so in my early teens I was drawing my classmates and then thought well, I might try to actually use some paint. And mum and dad had lots of art books and reproductions of very well known painters around the house: Turner, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Vlaminck. There was something about the way they really optimised the quality of painterly matter. They drew with it. So that was the thing that really pulled me in.\\n\\nIt wasn't until I got to my early 30s I really started to focus and realised this is the main game, this is what I want to do. So it's really been one painting leading to another. But every one of them â€“ whether it's a failure or a mediocre success or an outstanding success â€“ each one leads you to the next. And pretty much that's how it continues.\\n\\nThere's a motivation initially to paint a portrait that comes from observing someone, and they're unaware of that observation. And as soon as you ask them to sit for you they become aware of the observation so they become a little bit self-conscious. So you have to really work through that and somehow find that unguarded moment that will hopefully appear.\\n\\nI knew Hugo initially, as we all do, through his work. And then his daughter and our son were in the same year at school. When we initially met I said 'oh one day would you be interested' and he went 'oh, maybe' â€“ because he actually doesn't like making himself the centre of attention.\\n\\nThis was at home, in his house. It was the private, quiet Hugo. I didn't want to paint the famous persona, because that wasn't the Hugo I'd come to know. I'd come to know a more reflective person.\\n\\nThis was the second sitting we did, and I was drawing at the house. And there was a moment where he was at ease on the couch, and while we were talking, to collect his thoughts â€“ or maybe because he was bored with sitting, because it can be extremely boring â€“ his eye would just wander out through the courtyard door windows, to the courtyard. There's a beautiful 150-year-old jacaranda out there, and a garden â€“ and space, sky. So you know you could see his thoughts traveling. And that just seemed a quiet, reflective moment that created the unguarded moment that I was seeking.",

Born in Bundaberg, Queensland, Broadhurst toured Asia with musical theatre troupes in the early 1920s, and established a Performing Arts Academy in Shanghai. In London, she became a fashion designer, adopting the name â€˜Madame Pellierâ€™. Returning to Australia in 1949, she took up landscape painting and a decade later established Australian (Hand Printed) Wallpapers Pty Ltd. Disliking the conservative, muted tones that Australians favoured for interiors, she began producing vibrant and ornate prints that were unique for their experimentation with printing techniques, finishes and textures. In 1969 the company became known as Florence Broadhurst Wallpapers Pty Ltd and moved to premises in Paddington, where this photograph was taken by Lewis Morley in 1975. The Broadhurst Design Collection had grown to about 800 patterns when Broadhurst was murdered two years later (the case has never been solved). More than 500 examples have been revived by Sydney design and print company Signature Prints, and the designs have been archived by the Powerhouse Museum.",

She has performed with many Australian and international companies, making her name with her interpretations of roles by Handel and Mozart. \\n\\nHere Kenny is photographed by Polly Borland in her dressing room at the London Coliseum an hour before a dress rehearsal for _Der Rosenkavalier_, in which she played the lead role of a woman caught in a loveless marriage. â€˜It is one of my best roles and Polly wanted to photograph me in costume,â€™ Kenny said. â€˜It was a strange feeling really. A dressing room is a very private place and you feel very vulnerable and exposed, because youâ€™re creating your character with make-up and wigs ... I think she would have preferred to have seen me without my wig and with my hair in pins. But I didnâ€™t want to do that.â€™",

The first of her many cookbooks, _The Margaret Fulton Cookbook_, was published in 1968. Selling more than a million copies, it remains a staple in many kitchens around the country and is considered revolutionary for enabling Australian cooks to add international dishes and ideas to their everyday repertoires. â€˜I think Australians responded to this enormous excitement that I was feeling about food and they were feeling it too,â€™ she observed. Fulton was also the food editor for _Womanâ€™s Day_ magazine, making her one of the first in the industry to be both a cook and a food writer simultaneously. Fultonâ€™s promotion of an array of culinary delights are reflected in the ample spread she is photographed with in this portrait by Lewis Morley OAM. Morley established himself as one of the key British photographers of the 1960s and is known for his iconic image of a nude Christine Keeler straddling an Arne Jacobsen chair, taken in the midst of the Profumo affair during the Cold War. Morley moved to Australia in 1971 and produced photographs for various lifestyle, design and food publications, including his portrait of Florence Broadhurst which is also currently hanging in this gallery.",

It measures: 36.1 cm by 28.5.\\n\\nMargaret stands at a table covered by beautifully presented food. She smiles directly at the camera from the corner of a warmly lit dining room. Behind her are floor to ceiling curtains, drawn closed, bearing a repeat print motif of a small blue flower on a beige background. \\n\\nAt a right angle to the curtain is a recessed pine cabinet with glass doors. Margaret stands in front of the cabinets four shelves displaying blue and white china plates and bowls. On our right, a speckled brown marble fireplace and perched on the mantle is an arrangement of apricot and white roses in a silver bowl. Above the mantelpiece and against the beige wall is a framed, bold, black and white abstract, geometric art-work. \\n\\nMargaret is a full-figured, short-haired, smiling middle-aged woman and she stands behind a table laden with delicious-looking food and snacks. \\n\\nShe has an oval shaped face with a warm, light complexion and laugh-lines around her eyes. Her thick, red hair parts across her forehead. Subtle makeup highlights her brown eyes and eyebrows and soft red lipstick rims her open-mouthed smile. \\n\\nShe wears a brown beaded necklace with a fan shaped black and gold statement pendant, it stands out against her plain, beige, short-sleeved top and tightly pleated, flared skirt. At waist level, and as if about to lift and offer it to us, she holds the rim of a large silver platter of fruit on the table in front of her. \\n\\nThe pale-wood table is laden with tiered, edible arrangements; devilled eggs, roast meat, vegetables, salad, cheeses, brandy snaps, pastries, cake and strawberries.\\n\\nAmongst the bounty of food there are flowers, a blue and white china tureen with its lid on, crystal wine glasses and a silver candelabra with three tall white unlit candles.",

Both Cave and Mackevicius attended Caulfield Grammar School in Melbourne, where Cave formed his first band, The Boys Next Door. In 1980, when Cave had spent two years at art school, the band changed its name to The Birthday Party and moved to London, going on to be one of the most original, visceral and influential post-punk bands of the early 1980s. With several talented recruits, members of The Birthday Party formed The Bad Seeds, releasing their first album in 1984. Since then, Cave has participated in many fruitful musical collaborations and composed scores for films including _The Assassination of Jesse James_ and _The Road_, often in collaboration with Bad Seeds bandmate Warren Ellis. Since 2018 he has run The Red Hands Files, a website described by Cave as â€˜a strange exercise in communal vulnerability and transparencyâ€™ where he answers questions written by fans, with no topic off limits.",

Kelly sings with a marked Australian accent and his songs refer to specific Australian places and people; the album _Stolen Apples_ (2007), for example, includes a song about Gija artist Queenie McKenzie and Wangkajunga and Kukatja artist Rover Thomas. Though he has written most of his long and poetic song list alone, he also cultivates collaborations, particularly with First Nations performers including Archie Roach, Yothu Yindi and Kev Carmody, with whom he co-wrote the protest song â€˜From Little Things, Big Things Growâ€™, relating the story of the Gurindji peopleâ€™s fight for Land Rights in the 1960s and 70s. Portrait and fashion photographer Peter Brew-Bevanâ€™s black and white portrait features an introspective Kelly with downcast eyes, reflecting the intimate, personal and contemplative mood of many of his songs.",

At 15 he formed the Allen Brothers with singer Chris Bell, and by 1964 was part of a trio chosen to support Judy Garland on her world tour. He married Garlandâ€™s daughter Liza Minnelli in 1967 but they separated two years later. In the 1970s he became a successful cabaret performer and recording artist with songs such as â€˜I Go to Rioâ€™ and â€˜I Still Call Australia Homeâ€™. He also achieved success composing for other performers, co-writing Olivia Newton-Johnâ€™s Grammy-winning â€˜I Honestly Love Youâ€™ and Christopher Crossâ€™ â€˜Arthurâ€™s Theme (Best That you Can Do)â€™, which won best song at the 1981 Academy Awards. \\n\\nIn 1980, when this photograph was taken by William Yang, Allen had returned to Australia with his one-man stage extravaganza, Up in One: More than a Concert, and performed for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in the Royal Charity Concert at the Sydney Opera House on 27 May. Yang took the tender portrait of Allen lounging on a chaise at Wirian, artist Martin Sharpâ€™s Bellevue Hill home. Wirian was a hub for creatives in Sydney, including Yang, who documented its legendary cultural scene in the 1970s and 80s. Both artist and sitter are recognised as icons by the LGBTQIA+ community.",

                "transcript": "I had to come to terms with being Chinese, being gay, and just feeling comfortable as a human being. There are lots of people who aren't comfortable about that, still. And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. That's been my philosophy. I never consciously came out as a gay man, I was swept out by events at the time. And that was exactly what happened to me in the 70s. I was in the closet when I was in Brisbane, I came to Sydney in 1969. People were starting to come out in the early 70s, and suddenly there was this whole connection of gay people with each other, and it was really quite exciting. I also then became a photographer in Sydney as well.\\n\\nGenerally, my style of photography is I'm just photographing what's around me in my everyday life. At the time, I was living at Martin Sharp's mansion in Bellevue Hill and Peter Allen came to visit him. Peter was in town and he'd heard that this was a place that he should visit. He'd never met Martin before. And so he just came, to visit. I'd met Peter a few times before, just around the traps. I wouldn't say I got to know him well, but well enough to get that snap of him. So I was brushing shoulders with celebrities at that time. And I met Mel Gibson at one of the parties. And he asked me if I'd take a photograph of him because he needed a card. His parents, they used to answer all his fan mail and they needed a card to say \"best wishes from Mel\" or something, and answer their question. So he got me to do it. And so that's how I took those photographs of Mel. Patrick White never wanted to be interviewed, he never wanted to be photographed. But in this particular case, with the portrait that's in the gallery, Brett Whitely wanted to paint his portrait, I think for the Archibald. And Brett asked me, if I could photograph him so he could get a set of photographs of him. There was a rumour going around that I was the only person who Patrick would allow to photograph him, which wasn't true. But anyway, I never ever quashed the rumour, 'cuz it was all to my advantage. And so I took a very good set of photographs for Brett, and they were taken at Kate Fitzpatrick's place in Kings Cross, where she had a lunch to introduce Patrick to Brett.\\n\\nProbably the 80s was my most productive time and all those photographs came out, because I was brushing shoulders with celebrities. But after that period, say at the end of the 80s, I started to do self-portraits. I suppose it's was the evolution of my own story when I kind of claim my own story. And the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields, in the place where my uncle had been shot, William Fang Yuen, had been shot and I'd located that in my research of the event and I found the place. So I stood there in the cane fields and I somehow knew that this was an important event, because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event, which happened 72 years ago. But here I was, kind of retelling the story. And that was a very important thing, moment in my life. So I did that. One of the first ones in this cluster that I've got is called \"Self Portrait #2\" it came after the one of standing in the cane fields. But when I was about six years old, I'll tell you this story because almost in every interview I've ever done I've always told this story. It's become as John McDonald, the critic said, \"It's become my incantation.\"\\n\\nWhen I was six years old, one of the kids at school called me \"Ching Chong Chinaman, born in a jar, christened in a teapot. Ha, ha, ha.\" I had no idea what he was talking about, although I knew from his expression he was being horrible to me. So I went home to my mother and I said to her, \"Mom, I'm not Chinese, am I?\" And she said, \"Yes, you are.\" Her tone was hard, and it shocked me. And I knew in that moment, that being Chinese was like a terrible curse. And I could not rely on my mother for help. Or my brother, who was four years older than me, very much more experienced in the world. He chimed in, \"And you'd better get used to it.\" I claim my heritage in the 80s, because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged. I'm very happy that that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so, I feel that I'm living my art as well as my life. And so that's very satisfying for me.\\n\\nThen I'd done performance pieces, telling the personal story and realising that many of the images had stories. I realised that the handwriting makes my work more unique - my very handwriting. And so I've chosen more recently photographs that have got a story, which I can write on. And so that's usually a bit of a preference for me when choosing a photograph.",

After arriving in Australia in 1980 she worked as a translator of Chinese language films and with ABC radio in Darwin and Newcastle before joining SBS as a newsreader in 1988. There she gained devoted viewers through her exacting and formidable delivery and superbly cut tops and jackets. As host of the networkâ€™s _Fashionista_ program she built a reputation as a style authority. Known also as a comedian and a voice for social change, she has a huge social media following although she posts little, if anything, herself, retaining an intriguing air of mystery. \\n\\nGeorge Fetting took this photograph in a patch of natural light in a corner near the SBS cafeteria, the stationâ€™s employees passing by without raising an eyebrow. Chin states that she likes the portrait â€˜because itâ€™s so unashamedly attention-grabbing â€“ which isnâ€™t me at allâ€™.",

Type C photograph on paper measuring 120 centimetres high by 95 centimetres wide.  \\nLee-Lin Chin is photographed from the waist up, facing front on and standing against a white wall. Her face is made-up in the traditional Japanese â€˜geishaâ€™ style of makeup in contrast to her Chinese-Malay heritage.\\n\\nHer salt and peppered hair is cropped short and stands upright to frame her face, the light grey and white hairs at the front transitioning to black towards the back. Her face and neck are painted a chalky white. Her eyebrows are arched over almond-shaped eyes softly outlined in black pencil liner. Her eyes are opened wide in a dramatic fashion highlighting the whites of her eyes framing brown irises. Below her cheekbones, pale pink blush has been sparingly applied. Her plump lips have been covered in white makeup to disguise their natural shape. A vibrant crimson-red lipstick transforms her mouth to create an illusion of a small flower bud. \\n\\nThe white paint on her neck tapers out to a hazy edge, smudged around her collarbone and revealing her bare- skinned shoulders. Her arms are concealed in the bandeau of black silk folded under the fabric. The bandeau stops at waist height revealing the bare skin of her lower torso.",

Producers saw the image and invited her to appear on the _Mike Walsh Show_. Her guest spot quickly turned into a regular role, where she appeared in her own outrageous designs and showed her flair for comedy. She won a Gold Logie just two years after her first appearance and was soon the highest paid woman on Australian television. In 1985 she joined _Midday with Ray Martin_ and was later a regular panellist on _Beauty and the Beast_. She also had a successful career in musical theatre and toured for years with her one-woman show _Marlene: A tribute to Dietrich_. Little died in 2020 after a decade-long battle with Alzheimerâ€™s disease.\\n\\nRobin Sellick photographed Little in her Paddington home in 1994 for _Who Weekly_ magazine.

A specialist leg-spin bowler, he also made remarkable contributions as a slips fielder, lower order batsman and leader, securing him as one of the nationâ€™s sporting greats. Outside of cricket, Warne was a significant contributor to causes including Christchurch Earthquake Relief and fundraising for communities impacted by the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires. He was named an Officer of the Order of Australia three months after his sudden death at the age of 52.\\n\\nBroken Hill-based photographer Robin Sellick photographed Warne against the backdrop of the greenery surrounding the tennis court at the cricketerâ€™s Melbourne home.

Accolades followed for Ledgerâ€™s heartrending performance in _Brokeback Mountain_ (2005), for which he was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award, and won a New York Film Criticsâ€™ Circle Award and an Australian Film Institute Award. The last film he featured in was _The Dark Knight_ (2008). For his terrifying portrayal of the sociopathic Joker he won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA. The awards, however, were posthumous; a chronic insomniac, Ledger died in New York from a toxic combination of prescription drugs at the age of 28.\\n\\nThis intensely charged portrait was taken by American photographer and film director Bruce Weber in the Czech Republic while Ledger was filming _A Knightâ€™s Tale_, and appeared on the cover of _Vanity Fair_ in August 2000.

He is well known for his photographs of Nick Cave and Dave Graney and has taken publicity images and album covers for bands including U2, The Triffids and The Go Betweens. Over the past fifteen years Butcher's photographs have appeared in Melody Maker, Vox, Mojo, Rolling Stone and Vogue and he has edited and designed the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds fan magazine. He lives in London, where he is currently writing a biography of The Triffids's David McComb.",

We started the _Dave Graney Show_, and _Dave Graney and the mistLY_, and that's what we've been doing ever since.\\n\\n[Clare] It was at a time when music was incredibly popular, it was the only thing kind of going apart from TV, what, you know, four channels of TV, so everyone went out and watched bands, so it was really a great time.\\n\\n[Dave] We hated classic Australian pub rock, which was, is what's seen as the, you know, defining thing of that era. When you knew The Saints and Radio Birdman and The Sex Pistols, Public Image, the pop group Pere ubu. Why would you want to listen to pub rock?\\n\\nBleddyn has so many photos of us and they're probably the least representative. You should have seen the other photos. If you saw the magazine, it's Black and White magazine. It's nude rock star issue. It's quite hilarious for 90's pompousness. It's kind of a throw back to tits and ass magazines of the 50's, I think, but with 90's advertising gloss.\\n\\n[Clare] Lots of people took it quite seriously, unlike us, and Bleddyn, we didn't take it that seriously.\\n\\n[Clare] We weren't nude obviously,\\n\\n[Dave] We were, we put clothes on and dressed up.\\n\\n[Clare] The sausage one,\\n\\n[Dave] The sausage one.\\n\\n[Clare] Made it, though. What's the idea behind it?\\n\\n[Dave] Just a bandolero of meat. Just looks silly. It's funny, something being out of context. It's embarrassing. I would never present myself like that.\\n\\n[Clare] It was kind of odd to go to the opening of that and stare at these photos on the wall. They were blown up, just like, oh God. That's not what we had in mind when we had the picture taken. But it's fine...",

Recognised for his distinctive visual language, mark-making that references Kamilaroi designs and bold use of colour, Rennieâ€™s practice is often situated in the urban environment and engages with ideas of First Nations sovereignty. His early career was informed by American graffiti culture of the 1970s and 80s, and sculptures and installations that adapt and represent Kamilaroi motifs in the language of street art remain a significant aspect of his practice. This sensibility is reflected in Rennieâ€™s portrait by Sydney-based artist Jasper Knight. Known for his bright, brash colours and distinctive graphic approach, using materials such as spray paint, masonite and salvaged signage, Knight is also influenced by graffiti, pop art and mixed media practices. This can be seen here in the artistâ€™s incorporation of pegboard and street signs.",

The film is also a portrait of award-winning Yorta Yorta musician, rapper, comedy writer, actor and activist Adam Briggs (b. 1986). In the work, Briggs appears as the sensei of a jiu-jitsu group including Rennie and his daughter along with other First Nations friends, colleagues and actors, assembled in a hall emblazoned with the Aboriginal flag. Working to Briggsâ€™ command, they begin a drill sequence which is both a display of solidarity, skill and discipline, and also a symbolic defence against colonisation. Their collective call and response echoes the messages in Briggsâ€™ own lyrics which often forcefully call out racial discrimination, the Stolen Generations and deaths in custody. The workâ€™s soundtrack and visual sensibility reflect Rennieâ€™s interest in American â€˜Blaxploitationâ€™ and martial arts films which are key influences, along with references to the 1970s Black Panther movement. The high-volume score was written by A.B. Original, which stands for â€˜Always Black, Originalâ€™, and is an ongoing collaboration between Briggs and Ngarrindjeri record producer Daniel Rankine (aka â€˜Trialsâ€™).",

This portrait is from the still-photo component of the larger project, made together with Vernon Ah Kee and Behrouz Boochani. Participants were invited to have their portraits taken, using a means of their own choosing to conceal their identities while making a personal statement. Some of them chose flowers or bubbles.

The denial of the Maali/Black Swan serves as a greater metaphor for the failure of Europeans to acknowledge the beauty and sovereignty of First Nations peoples and their connection to this land, and the denial of queer people throughout history. This portrait is a tribute to WA, where Will grew up, and honours Garrettâ€™s First Nations heritage, two queer swans floating in the romantic haze of a disco-enthused lake.â€™\\n\\nWill Huxley and Garrett Huxley are Naarm/Melbourne-based collaborative performance and visual artists.

Alfonso has been painting with Ngaruwanajirri, which supports artists with lived experience of disability and fosters community and collaboration, since 1997. The art centreâ€™s name means â€œhelping one anotherâ€. The bicycle, featured in both his art and this portrait, serves as a personal inspiration to him. In 2024, one of his bicycle paintings was selected as a finalist in the NATSIAA (National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards). Captured with a large-format camera using Polaroid Type 665 film, this portrait highlights Alfonsoâ€™s quiet strength and enduring spirit.â€™\\n\\nNaarm/Melbourne-based Tobias Titz is a photographer and educator who has worked with First Nations communities in the Pilbara, Kimberley, Western Desert, Arnhem Land, Tiwi Islands and Central Australia for over 15 years.",

Across photography, film, installation and performance, toaishara contends with the effects of colonialism on Africa and its diaspora and how, in turn, it has shaped an image history. In his work, Black life is celebrated and joy and community are centred. Often drawing on the pictorial codes of studio portraiture, staged tableaux and the family album, toaishara is conscious of the way performance can be revolutionary and how collective energy is built through care and embodied action. \\n\\n_a most beautiful experiment_ responds to Congolese photographer Jean Depara's documentation of Kinshasa's nightlife in the 1960s. Full of life and music, Depara's photographs animate a moment in history after the Democratic Republic of Congo gained independence from Belgium's brutal colonial occupation in 1960. toaishara's film is a non-narrative tapestry that foregrounds the role of dance as an agent of self-possession; the urban environment a stage for a transformative and intentional act of freedom-making. In its use of dance as a mode of poetic activism, this film sits in gentle dialogue with works in the adjacent exhibition.",

At the age of 16, overcoming an initial rebellion against the discipline of dance, he joined his brother Stephen at the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association (NAISDA) dance school in Sydney and emerged as a breathtakingly original and compelling performer. With their brother David, Stephen and Russell formed Bangarra Dance Theatre, with Stephen as artistic director, David as resident  \\ncomposer and Russell as the company's principal dancer.\\n\\nIn Tracey Moffatt's _Some lads_, Russell, along with fellow dancers Gary Lang, Matthew Doyle and Graham Blanco, animate Moffatt's makeshift studio at the Aboriginal and Islander Dance Theatre in Sydney. In front of a painter's drop sheet, they turn the space of the image into a zone of dynamic possibility. An important early work in Moffatt's oeuvre, the series is equally significant as a tribute to the vision and influence of an important community of First Nations performers who themselves effected a profound shift in the cultural landscape of Australia.",

Unlike the staged ethnographic photographs taken of First Nations people by colonial photographers in the 19th century, the history of which Moffatt has routinely referenced in her work, the men in _Some lads_ are not passive or artificially posed. Rather they proudly and playfully engage with the camera. These are scenes of eruptive energy, where joy assumes a subversive power. This photograph features Graham Blanco.",

Alongside his design work, Nash produced photographs that document the action behind the scenes. While his photographs appear candid, they carry weight, capturing his subjects in the slip between the stage and the outside world. The dancers are photographed in the paint-up room, a sacred space where ochre is applied to the body in intentional designs. Through this process, the dancers become storytellers and are intimately connected to culture. Invited into this space, Nash captures this transformative practice with respect and reverence.  \\n\\n\\nThis portrait of Beau Dean Riley Smith was taken backstage at Barangaroo, on Gadigal Land, while the dancer was waiting to go on stage for Bangarra's performance of _Spirit_ for the Sydney Festival 2021. Nash described the photograph as: 'A moment between two worlds. I have photographed Beau all over the country and world in moments where he is transforming from one spirit to another. I had never seen him in a hoodie pre-show before.'",

Off screen, she was involved in community work in Fitzroy Crossing, advocating on issues relating to education and employment and becoming a director of the Indigenous-owned Kimberley Agricultural and Pastoral Company. In 2019, Lawford-Wolf tragically died while on tour with the Sydney Theatre Company's adaptation of Kate Grenville's _The Secret River_, a production she helped create. A cultural consultant and artistic collaborator with Bangarra Dance Theatre, her legacy was honoured in their 2021 production _SandSong_.\\n\\nPhotographer Stuart Spence took this portrait of Lawford-Wolf for a series in which he asked his subjects to interpret the theme of water. Presented with a selection of props for the shoot, as Spence recalls, Lawford-Wolf 'instantly gravitated to the fish, draping it delicately around her neck'. Her gaze, confident and at ease, pierces through the image.",

And I wanted to write a theatre that was different, had all different forms of acting in it whether it be music, dance, singing, a monologue. And I wanted to stay in the traditional way of storytelling but make it real, make it different. And the only way, and the only way I can do stories like that was to fall back on myself and my plays, like â€˜You know, youâ€™ve got a story yourself, youâ€™ve been to Alaska when you were 16, you know, you lived here, you lived there, youâ€™ve come from Christmas Creek station, youâ€™ve come up from nowhere and make a name for yourself in the acting world and that is an achievement for someone my age. And I never really thought about it because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m anything special. I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m still quite naive in that aspect.\\n\\nI wanted to make it honest too, â€˜cos you look at a lot of Aboriginal people that are working out there, thereâ€™s a lot of Aboriginal women that are working but not really strong Aboriginal womenâ€™s stories. And I wanted to make my point of view as a woman and as a proud Aboriginal woman, proud of where I come from, whether than be the backblocks of Woop Woop but yet that place still has a very big significance for me. I wanted to make Australia realise that they do have an Indigenous culture in Australia. They have it here. No, no, and Australia doesnâ€™t need to go anywhere else and adopt someone elseâ€™s Indigenous culture which a lot of people tend to do. But, you know, they have it here.

You know, it was a very different place for Aboriginal people in the 80s, but it was also a time when things were really starting to happen. I think what those photographs really demonstrate to me is a radical re-look at the way that Aboriginal people were being represented.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>I also look at every individual in the series â€“ all of them that I know, some of them that I am still very much in contact with â€“ and just think there was an alignment of the stars to bring us all together.</span>\\n\\n<span>Michael had an enormous influence on both my children. He was their uncle, and a connection between Michael and my children is very strong, so it's a very, very special photograph. And I remember Michael getting us to pose for that photograph. And I had no idea that it would become such an enduring image of the beauty that he could make.</span>\\n\\n<span>Brenda Croft:</span>\\n\\n<span>The image that day that he did with me and Dad... I can still remember that Dad's shirt had a big coffee stain on it, where he'd tipped his coffee on him. It didn't take very long. He just came in, took photographs. And I just, I love that image. You know, we used to go along to all the exhibitions that were on, around the traps. And Dad was there because he was friends with Ace, and Dad's, not bragging, but he was just really proud. And he was going 'Oh, you know, you've got to come to Michael's opening tomorrow night because you'll see an image ofÂ me and Brenda in it. Then Dad sort of wanders off somewhere and Michael's [under his breath] \"Brenda, Brenda, come 'ere, come 'ere\" and I went over and said \"What, what\" and he said 'I haven't printed it. What'll I do?\" And I just said, you know, \"Well if you want to make an old man happy, you'd better print it. So we did. We spent the entire night printing it in Sandy Edwards' studio, printing it by hand. So we framed it and and â€“ lucky for him â€“ Dad bought it at the opening.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>Darrell Sibosado:</span>\\n\\n<span>I actually love that image. For me, personally, it's one of the best photos I've seen of myself. It's the image that reflects me from that time, makes me think about it, you know, who I was at that time.Â </span>\\n\\n<span>So that day, I remember it was a bit organised. I kept saying yesterday I remember how disorganised Michael seemed. But this was a bit of a plan. But anyway, it was on the first floor, and we were in there, and it was quite simple. There was just him with a camera. He was so comfortable to be around. You know, even though he was quiet and everything, you knew it was a good quiet. It wasn't a quiet where he's thinking you're an idiot or anything like that. You know he's not thinking bad thoughts. And I just trusted him to do whatever he wants. So I just sat there and he took the photo and that's what came out.</span>",

Deftly working between imaging techniques, from tintypes to photomontage, Croft returns agency and authority to her sitters, as is extant in this triptych portrait of Russell Page from the Nunukul (Noonuccal) people and the Munaldjali clan of the Yugambeh people of south-east Queensland. Page was a renowned choreographer, dancer, actor and, with his brothers, co-founder of Bangarra Dance Theatre. These photographs were taken when Croft and Page were in Venice for the 47th Venice Biennale, for which Croft had co-curated the Australian pavilion exhibition _fluent: Emily Kame Kngwarreye, Yvonne Koolmatrie and Judy Watson_. For the first two weeks of the Biennale, Page performed his interpretation of a painting in the exhibition, with artist Judy Watson painting the designs on his body. In each of these photographs, the agile Page appears to leap at the camera from within the embrace of a tree, bringing First Nations culture into the heart of the European art world.",

As soon as I saw this, I ordered the boats to lay upon their oars in order to speak to them. But this was to little purpose for neither us nor Tupia could understand one word they said. When then through them some nails, beads, etc. ashore which they took up and seemed not ill-pleased in so much that I thought they beckoned us to come ashore. But in this we were mistaken, for as soon as we put the boat in again, they again came to oppose us, upon which I fired a musket between the two, which had no other effect that to make them retire back where bundles of their darts lay. And one of them took up a stone and threw at us, which caused my firing a second musket load with small shot. And although some of the shot struck the man, yet it had no other effect than to make him lay hold of a shield or target to defend himself.  \\nImmediately after this, we landed, which we had no sooner done than they throwed two darts at us. This obliged me to fire a third shot, soon after which they both made off, but not in such haste but what we might have taken one. But Mr Banks being of opinion that the darts were poisoned made me cautious how I advanced into the woods. We found here a few small huts made of the bark of trees, in one of which were four or five small children, with whom we left some strings of beads etc. A quantity of darts lay about the huts, these we took away with us.",

We walked until we completely tired ourselves, seeing by the way only one Indian who ran from us as soon as he saw us.\\n\\nThe soil wherever we saw it consisted of either swamps or light sandy soil on which grew very few species of trees, one which was large, yielding a gum â€¦ but every place was covered with vast quantities of grass. We saw many Indian houses and places where they had slept upon the grass without the least shelter; in these we left beads, ribbons etc. We saw one quadruped about the size of a rabbit. My greyhound just got sight of him and instantly lamd [sic] himself against a stump which lay concealed in the long grass. We also saw the dung of a large animal that had fed on grass which much resembled that of a stag; also the footsteps of an animal clawed like a dog or wolf and as large as the latter.\\n\\nMay the second. The morn was rainy and we who had got already so many plants were well contented to find an excuse for staying on board to examine them. In the afternoon however, we returned to our old occupation of collecting, in which we had our usual good success. Tupia, who strayed from us in pursuit of parrots, of which he shot several, told us on his return that he had seen nine Indians who ran from him as soon as they perceived him.\\n\\nMay 3. Our collection of plants was now grown so immensely large that it was necessary that some extraordinary care should be taken of them. I carried all the drying paper, nearly 200 quires of which the larger part was full, ashore and spreading them upon a sail in the sun kept them in this manner exposed the whole day, often turning them. By this means they came on board at night in very good condition.",

                "transcript": "Your Lordship has been informed that some of the convicts have been killed and wounded by natives, but that has I believe, never happened but when the convicts have been the aggressors. I have always found the natives friendly, and still retain the opinion I first formed of those people, that they do not betray a confidence placed in them.\\n\\nIn December 1788, one of the natives was seized for the purpose of learning the language and reconciling them to us, as mentioned in my former letter to your lordship, none of the natives having for some months come near the settlement. The man who was taken for that purpose appeared to be about 24 years of age and in three months was so reconciled that he was freed from all restraint and lived with me perfectly satisfied with his situation.\\n\\nIn the beginning of the following April, numbers of the natives were found dead with the smallpox in different parts of the harbour. It is not possible to determine the number of natives who were carried off by this fatal disorder; it must be great. And judging from the information of the native now living with us, and who had recovered from the disorder before he was taken, one half of those who inhabit this part of the country died. And as the natives always retired from where the disorder appeared and which some must have carried with them, it must have been spread to a considerable distance, as well as inland as along the coast. We have seen traces of it wherever we have been.\\n\\nThat they have some idea of a future state appears from their belief in spirits and from saying that the bones of the dead are in the chase, but the body in the clouds. And the question has been asked, do the white men go thither?",

As soon as I saw this, I ordered the boats to lay upon their oars in order to speak to them. But this was to little purpose for neither us nor Tupia could understand one word they said. When then through them some nails, beads, etc. ashore which they took up and seemed not ill-pleased in so much that I thought they beckoned us to come ashore. But in this we were mistaken, for as soon as we put the boat in again, they again came to oppose us, upon which I fired a musket between the two, which had no other effect that to make them retire back where bundles of their darts lay. And one of them took up a stone and threw at us, which caused my firing a second musket load with small shot. And although some of the shot struck the man, yet it had no other effect than to make him lay hold of a shield or target to defend himself.  \\nImmediately after this, we landed, which we had no sooner done than they throwed two darts at us. This obliged me to fire a third shot, soon after which they both made off, but not in such haste but what we might have taken one. But Mr Banks being of opinion that the darts were poisoned made me cautious how I advanced into the woods. We found here a few small huts made of the bark of trees, in one of which were four or five small children, with whom we left some strings of beads etc. A quantity of darts lay about the huts, these we took away with us.",

It is a general and benumbing course of misery that I undergo in this imprisonment, but by dwelling on thy most charming letters, every little of thy tender anxiety and distress, is afresh called up in vivid colouring to my maddened imagination. I am, as it were, shut up in a cask that has been rolled with violence from the top of hope down in the vale of misfortune; I am bruised and well-nigh stunned out of my senses; but cannot thou imagine the addition it would be to this misery for the cask to have been drawn full of spike nails; - such is the increase of misery to my feelings on thinking intensely of thee.\\n\\nI have many friends, but yet before thee they disappear as stars before the rays of a morning sun. I cannot connect the idea of happiness with anything but thee. Without thee, the world would be a blank. I might indeed receive some gratification from distinction and applause of society; but where could be the faithful friend who would enjoy and share this with me â€“ into whose bosom my full heart could unburthen [sic] itself of excess of joy. Where would be that sweet intercourse of soul, that fine seasoning of happiness, without which a degree of insipidity attends all our enjoyments? From thee, my beloved, and thee only it is that I look to receive this zest for life, this height of luxury.\\n\\nI love thee most tenderly.

In this work, beams of fluorescent light shoot across the vast landscape of Gundungurra and Dharug Country in the Blue Mountains, depicted in von GuÃ©rardâ€™s oil painting _Weatherboard Creek Falls_ 1863. In von GuÃ©rardâ€™s lithograph of the same scene, he replaced the First Nations figure in his original work with four European figures admiring the spectacular vista. Ross has repurposed the lithograph but returned First Nations people to the scene, where they are circled around a campfire. The title re-locates the setting from NSW to Van Diemenâ€™s Land (lutruwita/Tasmania), a further disorientation.",

Itâ€™s easy to put a mark on a ballot paper, and I must say this definitely, that there was a small minority group of sincere Australian people but I would say 75 [per cent] of those who voted Yes did it to clear their guilty conscience.\\n\\nIncidentally, itâ€™s interesting to understand why those terrible discriminative laws were put into the books. In the first place, our civic fathers, or the white manâ€™s civic fathers of long ago, during the â€˜soothing of the dying pillowâ€™ era, the politicians, or the statesmen of that time, were writing over to Queen Victoria saying, â€˜The Aborigine is dying out.â€™ And true, he was â€“ they were poisoning him with strychnine in the waterholes and they were shooting him, and they were doing all sorts of things. And the Aborigine dropped from 300,000 strong to 80,000 in a very short period of time. So it was quite natural for them to say the Aborigine was a dying race.\\n\\nNow it was during this period of time that the Constitution was being fixed, and as they thought we were a dying race, to save themselves a lot of bother they said, â€˜Well we will not count the Aborigines and we do not have to make laws for the Aborigines, because theyâ€™re going to die out anywayâ€™. And this is the reason today why Aboriginals have not had any education, any decent housing, any facilities that the white Australian enjoys today. Itâ€™s because of that stupid business of thinking the Aboriginals were going to die out.\\n\\nMind you, the Aboriginals are a determined lot, and theyâ€™re quite ungrateful. They didnâ€™t die, they lived on and are still living on; in spite of the many attempts to commit genocide and assassinate us all, we are still here. I think weâ€™ll last the white man out, truly.",

                "transcript": "In 1965 I think it was, we were invited to go in and talk to the then prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies. There was a deputation from all over Australia of Aboriginal spokesmen and women and we did go in. Sir Robert Menzies had told the public and the politicians, the people of the House, that he would not have a referendum in his lifetime as prime minister. Heâ€™d been badly beaten on the referendum before where he had appealed to the people to outlaw Communism and when the people said â€˜No outlawing of the Communist Partyâ€™, Sir Robert Menzies refused then to have anything to do with referendums in his lifetime as prime minister.\\n\\nWe lobbied the House of Parliament and itâ€™s to their discredit, really, that when we asked them to bring out the laws concerning the Aboriginal people that there was no laws, no books on the Aboriginal people in their archives or libraries, and they had to quickly have them printed, so that the politicians could read what it was, for and against the Aborigines. There was one, however, on the national â€“ the Canberra law book saying that if Aboriginals go into Canberra, any Justice of the Peace could declare them illegal immigrants into Canberra and they could be chased out of Canberra. This still applied to us, incidentally, at this period of time. And we always made a joke of it when we went to Canberra, you know, â€˜If you get into trouble, you know the law on the book. If a JP says Get Out, make sure you get your blanket,â€™ because the law still said that before sending them out of Canberra, they must first issue them with one government blanket. So we were determined weâ€™d get our government blanket if ever they threw us out.  \\nWe told everyone this and we made it a laughingstock â€“ Canberra a laughingstock â€“ to such an extent that the first thing Sir Robert Menzies did was delete that off the Canberra constitution. So itâ€™s no longer there.",

Oodgerooo was an activist, poet, writer and educator.\\n\\nThe portrait is a framed oil painting on board, measuring 104 cm high and 83.7 cm wide with the frame having a depth of 5.1 cm.\\n\\nOodgeroo is a slim middle-aged woman, seated angled to the left against a dramatic and moody background. Behind her, dark greens merge into black. Highlights of emerald green flicker across the sky and a brighter lime green surrounds her head. Flecks of white suggest distant stars beyond this green-tinted atmosphere.  \\nTwo sharp craggy hills in deep shadow appear in the lower third, to the left of the subject. In front of them a spindly leafless tree reaches its fine black branches into the sky. \\n\\nIn the foreground, Oodgeroo sits in a straight-backed chair upholstered in soft turquoise cloth. Her face is framed by black curly hair cut just below her ears. Her skin is a deep rich brown. Soft light filters down from the upper left, creating a gentle sheen of lighter brown across her brow, cheeks, the tip of her nose and chin.\\n\\nHer large dark eyes, framed by strong black brows, gaze out to her upper left. The play of light also emphasises her prominent cheek bones, straight nose and full closed lips.\\n\\nHer neck is long and slim, with the muscles on either side of her jaw standing out, stretching down to her exposed clavicle.\\n\\nOodgeroo wears a simple round-necked white blouse underneath an elegant formal cerulean blue jacket with white edging on collar and sleeves, with a matching tailored straight skirt. The portrait ends just above her knees.  \\nHer hands lie on an open book in her lap, right hand over left. The pages, sepia flecked with white, are empty.\\n\\nHer relaxed pose and distant gaze give a sense of thoughtful introspection.\\n\\nAudio description written by Krysia Kitch and voiced by Amy Midddleby",

That year he was appointed as a naturalist on Cookâ€™s second voyage on the HMS _Resolution_, accompanied by his son, George. Johann is depicted with a sprig of _Forstera sedifolia_ tucked in his hatband, holding a bellbird; specimens of a wattlebird, a saddleback and a honeyeater lie lifeless on the ground.",

In von GuÃ©rardâ€™s lithograph of the same scene, he replaced the First Nations figure in his original work with four European figures admiring the spectacular vista. Ross has repurposed the lithograph but returned First Nations people to the scene, where they are circled around a campfire.

It is a heartbreaking image of two women out in their nawi (bark canoe) fishing, the fire on their nawi ready to cook the fish and take it back to feed their families. But there is a big ship in the distance pulling a net full of fish that falls out of the frame toward the title, THE BEGINNING OF GREED. People who know the story of Barangaroo the celebrated fisherwoman and other Cammeraygal women who belong to Sydney Harbour and its surrounding waters understand this image deeper than the bulging net. The centring of these women in Joanâ€™s work is subtle but their presence vibrates through history.â€™ Coby Edgar",

Joanâ€™s work is a lie made from lies - but itâ€™s closer to a truth that many First Nations people would recognise as real.

In 1787, he was appointed to command HMS _Bounty_ on a voyage to Tahiti, a journey that infamously ended in mutiny. Appointed Governor of New South Wales through the recommendation of Joseph Banks, Blighâ€™s brief was to curb the trade in rum and the influence of powerful, wealthy colonists. His abrasive manner and rigid adherence to orders created conflict over land, town planning and convict labour. Such issues led to him being deposed in Australiaâ€™s first and only military coup, the â€˜Rum Rebellionâ€™.",

Just before sunrise, Mr Christian and the master at arms and several officers came into my cabin while I was fast asleep, and seizing me, tied my hands with a cord and threatened instant death if I made the least noise. I called sufficiently loud to alarm the officers, who found themselves equally secured by sentinels at their doors. There were now three men at my cabin door and four inside. Mr Christian had a cutlass and the others were armed with muskets and bayonets.\\n\\nI was carried on deck in my shirt, in torture with a severe bandage around my wrists, where I found no man to rescue me. I asked the reason for such a violent act, but I was threatened to be put to death if I said a word. The boatswain was ordered to hoist the small cutter out, with a threat if he did not do it instantly to take care of himself. But on a representation that this boat was very leaky, he was directed to hoist the launch out. Mr Hayward and Hallet, midshipmen, and Mr Samuels, clerk, were now ordered into the boat. I assumed my authority and demanded the cause of such an order, endeavouring to bring someone to a sense of his duty, but it was to no effect. â€˜Hold your tongue sir, or you are dead this instantâ€™, was constantly repeated to me.\\n\\nI continued to endeavour to change the tide of affairs, when Christian changed the cutlass he had in his hand for a bayonet and holding me with a strong grip by the cord that tied my hands, he continued to threaten me with instant death if I did not be quiet. The villains around me had their pieces cocked and bayonets fixed and particular people were now called on to go into the boat and were hurried over the side. With those people, I concluded of course, that I was to be set adrift. I therefore in making another effort to bring about a change, expressed myself loudly in such a manner as to be saluted with â€˜blow his brains outâ€™.",

Quite an extraordinary achievement. And then the insurrection that he faced as fourth governor of New South Wales, the so called â€œRum Rebellionâ€ of 1808. In both cases Bligh was vindicated by their Lordships of the Admiralty, and in due course promoted. But the experiences clearly affected him.\\n\\nSince 1808, each and every phase of our history has brought forth an aspect of William Bligh that seems apposite to the day. The martinet, the tyrant, versus the gentleman, an officer of the Royal Navy. This William Bligh is none of those at all. This is Bligh at the age of 25. A very ambitious young man, highly skilled in cartography and navigation, who was hand-picked by James Cook to go aboard The Resolution together with the artist John Webber.\\n\\nSo it is that we find Bligh, Cook, and the artist John Webber all together on the same ship, and thatâ€™s given rise to the attribution of this painting to John Webber.",

John Webber joined Cookâ€™s third voyage in July 1776, making around 200 drawings and watercolours of topographical, natural history and ethnographic subjects. This portrait was completed in London three years after Cookâ€™s death in Hawaii in February 1779. In the context of this exhibition, and alongside Rossâ€™ own depiction of Cook, the painting demonstrates how portraiture was used to promote and perpetuate the colonial project.",

As soon as I saw this, I ordered the boats to lay upon their oars in order to speak to them. But this was to little purpose for neither us nor Tupia could understand one word they said. When then through them some nails, beads, etc. ashore which they took up and seemed not ill-pleased in so much that I thought they beckoned us to come ashore. But in this we were mistaken, for as soon as we put the boat in again, they again came to oppose us, upon which I fired a musket between the two, which had no other effect that to make them retire back where bundles of their darts lay. And one of them took up a stone and threw at us, which caused my firing a second musket load with small shot. And although some of the shot struck the man, yet it had no other effect than to make him lay hold of a shield or target to defend himself.  \\nImmediately after this, we landed, which we had no sooner done than they throwed two darts at us. This obliged me to fire a third shot, soon after which they both made off, but not in such haste but what we might have taken one. But Mr Banks being of opinion that the darts were poisoned made me cautious how I advanced into the woods. We found here a few small huts made of the bark of trees, in one of which were four or five small children, with whom we left some strings of beads etc. A quantity of darts lay about the huts, these we took away with us.",

He did three paintings from life on that trip, before Cook's fatal end. Cook wanted one of them to go to his wife. So when Webber returned in late, I think it was about November of 1780, he has these two portraits. But Mrs Cook looks at them and says \"No, I can't see my kind and considerate husband there\" and so poor Webber, very disappointed, but he takes his two portraits, the rejected ones, and from those two, he paints this portrait, for Mrs Cook. And she loved it. It made him look tall, it made him look elegant. It made him a gentleman.\\n\\nBecause he was in his studio in London he could get back properly, he could paint. And he could try and inject into that portrait all that he knew. He'd spent nearly two years in very close contact with this man, so he knew him well. He wanted to bring those two portraits together, in this one. And it's the last 18th-century portrait of Cook, in existence.",

For the past 100 years this has meant that our view of the world and its events has been through the viewfinder of photojournalism.\\n\\nLong before photography, in the 1700s when Captain James Cook was chartering the open seas, the images of record were the responsibility of such artists as John Webber who, whilst a member of Cookâ€™s crew over many voyages, created paintings and drawings of the situations and people the explorers encountered.\\n\\nThese were encounters with places and people which were, up to that time, unheard of and unknown, places such as Australia, and the Pacific, and Hawaiian islands beyond it.\\n\\nIt was through the art of men like John Webber and John Cleveley, who was also a member of Captain Cookâ€™s crew, that the world was first able to see the tragedy of Cookâ€™s murder by Hawaiian islanders, a sensational event that has been interpreted by many artists. Some, painting long after the incident, have brought increasing layers of imagination to the facts.\\n\\nBut these are the images that have formed our belief in how things really were, just as todayâ€™s photojournalism encourages us to believe that we are seeing the truth.",

This composite of untruths is furthered by Rossâ€™ repurposing of an 18th-century engraving of a kangaroo to recreate a stone statue, carved by convicts, that still stands atop Manlyâ€™s Kangaroo Hill. Enjoying the view alongside her collared companion, a woman stands in a verdant landscape partly taken from Lycettâ€™s _The Sugar Loaf Mountain, near New Castle, New South Wales_ 1824. These fictional scenes echo the compilation of â€˜viewsâ€™ that formed the basis of histories written and repeated by those in positions of power.",

John Macarthurâ€™s exile lasted eight years, during which James completed his schooling. After returning home he became involved in the familyâ€™s various agricultural ventures, and with his brother William he gradually progressed into the role of business and estate manager as his fatherâ€™s health deteriorated. \\n\\nThe reverse of this silhouette is inscribed â€˜J Macarthur Esq. of Camdenâ€™ â€“ Camden Park, near Menangle, New South Wales, being the familyâ€™s flagship property. This indicates it was made between John Macarthurâ€™s death in 1834, when James and his surviving brothers inherited the bulk of their fatherâ€™s estate, and the early 1840s, when photography started making silhouette artists redundant. It may have been made during Jamesâ€™ visit to England from 1836 to 1838, when he became engaged and was married.",

In the course of it, Stokes charted much of what is now the coast of the Northern Territory; gave Darwin its name (after his former shipmate, Charles Darwin); and surveyed the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Arafura Sea, the Torres Strait, the Western Australian coast, and Bass Strait. He and Fanny married in Sydney in January 1841. Later the same year, Stoke succeeded to the command of the Beagle. Their daughter was born in 1842. Fanny returned with Stokes to England in 1843 and died while en route to Sydney again in 1848. Back in England from 1851, Stokes was eventually promoted to admiral. He died at his home, Scotchwell, in Pembrokeshire, in June 1885, survived by his second wife, Louisa, whom heâ€™d married in 1856, and by his daughter from his marriage to Fanny.",

                "transcript": "A portrait of free-settler Fanny Jane Marlay by an unknown artist in 1841. Watercolour on ivory positioned in a mountboard cut into a stretched octagon shape and coloured a deep mustard yellow. Encased in a velvet-lined burgundy case with a clasp on the right side it measures 7.5 cm in height and 6.3 cm wide. \\n\\nFanny Jane fills the frame. Her pearly white skin contrasts with the blue of her garment and the dark brown background which enhances the creaminess of her complexion. The brush marks of the artist are evident with hatching and stippling of colours being used to create gradations in colour. \\n\\nShe wears a sapphire blue broad brim hat which creates a halo around her face. The hat is elaborately decorated in white feathers that spill over the hat, drooping down towards her face and left shoulder.\\n\\nHer hair is styled in loose finger waves covering her forehead and ears and pulled back. Elegant gold earrings with peach-coloured stones dangle from beneath her hair. Her eyebrows are slightly arched over almond-shaped and heavy-lidded eyes which are the same blue as her hat. Her nose is strong and straight, her cheeks coloured with a peachy blush and her narrow lips curve up in a subtle smile. Her long neck is adorned with a thick coiled gold necklace decorated with a peach-coloured stone in the centre to match her earrings. \\n\\nShe wears a blue dress that complements her hat with a broad neckline that is edged in delicate translucent lace. The lace stands up, reaching towards her face, shorter at the front and becoming taller at the back with a triangular trimmed edge. This triangular edging is mirrored in the blue fabric of her dress, where the neckline is also trimmed in a row of blue triangles.",

London-born, Lewis had worked as a surveyor and draftsman for almost fifteen years before being appointed to a position in the office of the Surveyor-General of New South Wales, Thomas Mitchell. Lewis assisted Mitchell in surveying areas of the Great Dividing Range and, at Mitchellâ€™s instigation, was appointed New South Wales Government Architect in 1835. During his fifteen year tenure in this role, Lewis oversaw the implementation of an ambitious program of public works, designing churches, schools, police stations, courthouses and prisons, as well as residences. Examples of his buildings include the courthouses and gaols at Darlinghurst and Berrima; the Customs House at Circular Quay; the Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum (now known as Gladesville Hospital); the Kingâ€™s School, Parramatta; and Richmond Villa, constructed beside the Domain as Lewisâ€™s private residence in 1849, but relocated to Millers Point in the 1970s. Lewis also supervised the construction of Sydneyâ€™s Government House, designed in London by Edward Blore and comlpeted in 1845. Lewis resigned as Government Architect in 1849 pending an official enquiry that was to find that he had misappropriated materials intended for the first Australian Museum. Of his and Elizabethâ€™s five children, three â€“ sons Oswald, Mortimer junior and Frederick â€“ became architects. Lewis went into private practice with Oswald for a time. He died in Sydney in March 1879.\\n\\nDuring the 1830s, Mortimer Lewis acquired seventeen acres of coastal land in what is now the Sydney suburb of Bronte. Lewis commenced building a villa on the property â€“ Bronte House â€“ but managed to complete only the dining and drawing rooms before being forced to sell in 1843. The house was completed for the new owners, politician Robert Lowe and his wife, Georgiana, in 1845.\\n\\nOpinions vary on whether these portraits of Mortimer and Elizabeth Lewis were painted in England before they left for Australia, or are the work of a colonial artist. They remained in the collection of the Lewis family until being purchased by Leo Schofield, then the occupant of Bronte House, in 1998. They hung in Bronte House until gifted by Schofield to the National Portrait Gallery in 2002.",

He also acquired land in the Hunter Valley and at his Tomago estate engaged in winegrowing along with the cultivation of crops including wheat and sugar cane. Elected to the first New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843, he advocated free trade and worked to open British markets to colonial wheat. He was also interested in education, social welfare and law reform and became a member of the Aborigines Protection Society after appearing in trials arising from the Myall Creek atrocity of 1838. An â€˜able, enlightened, honest and uncompromising public manâ€™, Richard Windeyer died from a combination of illness, overwork and financial worries at the age of forty-one.",

In 1856 the family moved to Yarra Cottage at Carrington on the north-west shore of Port Stephens, where she made this portrait of her six children. For many women of Mariaâ€™s class, painting and sketching were both a useful form of personal recordkeeping and a signifier of leisure and propriety. â€˜Ladies might do much to assist their husbands in the arduous task of establishing themselves securely and agreeably in a new country,â€™ stated a 1849 guide for Australian Agricultural Company employees. â€˜The good conduct of home matters must depend on them just as much there as anywhere else.â€™ Accordingly, Maria Brownriggâ€™s only known work documents a dignified Victorian drawing room, and in its meticulous, time-consuming execution it speaks volumes about notions of femininity. For this reason, and despite their supposedly â€˜amateurâ€™ status, works like this are highly prized by curators and historians for their richness of detail about costume, interiors and decorative arts; and for what they reveal about the colonistsâ€™ aspirations to gentility.",

The daughter of James Mangles â€“ an East India Company director and Member of Parliament â€“ Ellen was thirteen when she snared the attention of naval officer James Stirling (1791â€“1865), a family acquaintance. Described as â€˜adventurous, not yet introduced to the simpering ways of high society, wellâ€“educated, amusing and attractiveâ€™, Ellen is held by family lore to have been appealing to Stirling for her energy and lack of affectation. They were married on her sixteenth birthday in September 1823 and their first child was born the following year. In 1827, Stirling was given command of a voyage commissioned with identifying a new site for a British garrison on the west Australian coast. On his return to London, he presented the Colonial Office with a case for the establishment of a settlement on the Swan River. He was appointed lieutenant-governor of the new colony and in early 1829 Ellen sailed with him to the place that became Perth. Ellenâ€™s unpretentious manner served her well in a colony that, for the early part of Stirlingâ€™s tenure, was a dishevelled assortment of tents and timber houses. Stirlingâ€™s surveyor-general, John Septimus Roe, considered her â€˜affable and unaffectedâ€™ and her friend Georgiana Molloy wrote of Ellen as â€˜exceedingly amiable and pleasingly naturalâ€™.\\n\\nEllen maintained a gentrified style of living and as the colonyâ€™s pre-eminent lady presided at race meetings, hunts and other â€˜entertainmentsâ€™. Her charm and youth are said to have reflected well on her husband, softening some of the criticism of his governorship. Ellen had seven children during her ten years in Western Australia and another three following her return to Britain. Sir Thomas Phillips (1770â€“1845) was one of Regency Londonâ€™s most prolific and fashionable portraitists. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1792 and by 1796 was primarily occupied with portraiture. Among his subjects were botanist Sir Joseph Banks; explorer Sir John Franklin; poets William Blake and Lord Byron; and scientist Michael Faraday. Records held by the National Portrait Gallery in London show that Ellen Stirling sat for Phillips just before she left for Australia, at which time she was several months pregnant with her second child. Her portrait was displayed in the Mangles family home in Surrey and remained in the possession of Ellenâ€™s descendants until acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in 2008.",

The second box I also hope to ship but Mr Drummond who offered to fill it has been so dilatory that it has not yet made its appearance.\\n\\nIf my letter has reached you, you will know that Number One has been filled by Captain Meares. They all appear healthy plants. I sincerely hope the contents of both the boxes may arrive safely in England and that they may meet with your approbation. I should wish you to mention which of the two cases arrive in the best order and also which of the two contains the most valuable collection. Captain Meares will be much gratified to hear that his exertions have been successful, as he has been very kind in obtaining flowering shrubs. You will also receive by the _Hero_ the specimens collected and arranged by Miss Vittoria Meares and I think they are so well done that they will be valuable to you or at least to some of your friends.\\n\\nAny curious fruit trees would be an acceptable offering to Captain Meares in return for what he has done. But as he is not overburdened with riches and the large cases are rather expensive, you had better send his portion with mine or in case of our having left the colony, make some arrangement about the payment. He is very clever with everything connected with gardening. When you write to him do not allude to what I have said about expenses.\\n\\nThe box which Drummond undertook to fill has not yet arrived. It is not my fault if it is left behind for I have done all in my power to hurry the old man but he is rather obstinate and likes to have his own way. All the fruit trees that came out in the last box are dead but those that arrived in the _Shepherd_ are very flourishing. I am going to ride to Woodmanâ€™s Point in quest of shells. I walked there and back the other day, a distance of twelve miles without picking up one, but I hope I shall be more successful this morning.",

In the painting Martha is attired in a silk satin evening dress, with dark ringlets cascading down her neck. Her familyâ€™s stature probably afforded her an education at the prestigious Ellinthorp Hall, where Mundy was a teacher. Married while still in her teens and subsequently the mother to several children, Martha died of tuberculosis at the age of 31.",

Itâ€™s an uncomfortable collection of works because it evidences the trials of finding common ground.

Born in Glastonbury, Somerset, he received tuition from French silhouette artist Augustin Edouart, before going to America and working for the next ten years in New York, Philadelphia and Boston. His return to England in the mid-1840s coincided with the downturn in demand for profile portraits occasioned by photography which, by the 1860s, had rendered art forms such as the silhouette passÃ©. This silhouette depicts the family of Francis MacKenzie (1806â€“1851, seated far right) at Adlington Hall in Standish, Lancashire. Following Francis MacKenzieâ€™s death, his widow, Maria (1810â€“1874, third from left) emigrated to Australia with her five children. Mariaâ€™s eldest son, John (1833â€“1917, seated, left, at the table), was Examiner of Coalfields in the Illawarra from 1863 and 1865, later becoming Examiner of Coalfields for NSW. Her sons Walter (1835â€“1886, seated, right, at the table) and Kenneth (d. 1903) are thought to have become clergymen. Her youngest daughter, Maria (1842â€“ 1917, second from left), married a doctor, Alexander Morson, in 1875. Another daughter, Caroline (1837â€“1922, fourth from left), remained unmarried and died at the family property near Dapto in 1922. Other sitters shown in the silhouette are Mariaâ€™s mother, Mrs Thomas Edwards (far left); and her youngest child, William, who died, aged six, in 1851. Maria MacKenzie died at Wallerawang in New South Wales in 1874. The silhouette was bequeathed to the Gallery by her great-grandaughter in 2007.",

                "transcript": "The MacKenzie Family silhouette by Samuel Metford was created in 1846. It is a brush and ink, pen and ink, stencil cut-out with watercolour highlights on paper. It measures 43 cm high by 64 cm wide. \\n\\nThis artwork depicts the family of Francis MacKenzie, whose family, after he died in 1856, settled in Australia. \\n\\nThe picture is a landscape format. The background is a large high-ceilinged room, depicted on a sepia-toned paper with delicate lines and minimal monochromatic watery grey highlights. Dominating the back wall are two large identical Georgian style windows. A thick curtain rod runs the breadth of both, finished with decorative round ends. Long drapes hang on either side of each window, cinched near their base and pooling on the floor. Through the windows there is a faint view of distant land and hills, two buildings and an empty sky. At the height of the window ledge a horizontal moulding runs the full distance of the room. The floor is covered in a pattern of repeating wide bands of circle motifs. \\n\\nThe family of nine are depicted in this scene in silhouette, cut from black paper with small additions of white and gold paint. Everyone is arranged in five groups spread evenly across the room.\\n\\nOn the far left in the foreground is an older woman and a young girl, facing each other. The older woman is seated in a high-backed rocking chair facing the right. She is diminutive, wearing a bonnet and a high-necked full-length dress with long sleeves. The young girl stands up straight with hair swept back in a low bun, wearing a dress with a scooped neck line with a bell-shaped skirt ending at her knees. In her right hand she is holding an open book in front of her chest.\\n\\nTo the right in the mid ground is a woman sitting straight in a low-backed dining chair, facing a girl to her right. The woman is wearing a bonnet and a full-length dress with a softly layered collar. The girl before her stands up straight, her head bent down slightly, her hair swept back in a low bun. She is dressed like the younger girl with the addition of long pantaloons. In her right hand she is holding up a single flower stem towards the woman. \\n\\nTo the right of this group, in the centre of the scene and positioned between the two large windows, are two boys sitting at a small round table. The first boy has short hair and is wearing a long sleeved short-waisted jacket with a white folded stiff collar and long pants, his right arm bent upward, his index finger pointing. Facing him is a similarly dressed smaller boy, also sitting straight on a dining chair, looking down, his right arm raised. A lamp illuminates the board game between them.\\n\\nTo the right in the foreground is a young child standing on their own facing the left. The child has short hair and is wearing a dress like the young girls. The childâ€™s right hand is holding a long string attached to a small horse toy being pulled behind. \\n\\nOn the far right in the mid ground is a boy standing in front of a seated man. The boy is standing straight facing the right, dressed like the other boys. In his left hand he is balancing a model ship on his fingertips, holding it out towards the man. The man is sitting straight in a dining chair, wearing a long-sleeved jacket, with a crisp upturned white collar. His hands rest in his lap close to his body. His legs are crossed, right over left.",

                    "content": "Sir Joseph Banks KGB (1743â€“1820) was the powerful President of Londonâ€™s Royal Society for more than forty years, from 1778 to 1820. Banks grew up on his fatherâ€™s Lincolnshire estate and sharpened his interest in botany at Eton and Oxford. At the age of twenty-five, he suggested to the council of the Royal Society that they recommend him for inclusion on the voyage of the Endeavour, commanded by James Cook. On the three-year trip, he and Daniel Solander collected hundreds of specimens of plants and animals of the South Seas. For the rest of his life Banks was one of the sparkling stars of Enlightenment London. It was he who endorsed New South Wales as a site for a penal settlement; he was a patron of Matthew Flinders and others; and he corresponded zestfully with all the early governors of New South Wales. From 1788 to about 1810, though Banks held no official post (there was no â€˜master planâ€™ for the settlement of the Colony, nor Department to administer it) he was a continuous advocate for the colony and his role as effective head of Australian affairs was widely acknowledged. Late in life, Banksâ€™s chief interests were the development of superior sheep varieties and the drainage of the Lincolnshire fens to create pasture. It is largely down to Banksâ€™s personal enthusiasm for merino sheep that specimens of the breed were established in Australia within a couple of decades of English settlement. John Macarthur was able to purchase seven rams and three ewes at the first public auction of merinos, supervised by Banks, near the Pagoda at Kew Gardens on 15 August 1804. Six of the beasts survived to land at Sydney on 7 July 1805. As a result, in years to come, Englandâ€™s irksome dependence on European wool would be eased.\\n\\nThomas Phillips (1770â€“1845) painted Banks several times, and duplicated more than one of his own portraits of the great man. In this one, Banks sits with fen drainage plans to hand, wearing the uniform of the Lincolnshire Supplemental Militia, set off with the insignia of the Red Ribbon of the Order of the Bath which was awarded to him by his friend and fellow sheep enthusiast, King George III (â€˜Farmer Georgeâ€™) in 1795.",

In a navy, gold and red navel jacket, an 8-pointed silver star at his breast, he holds a paper map, his powdered hair and fleshy face in a closed, thoughtful expression.\\n\\nHis skin stands out against the portraitâ€™s mud-brown background. On the right, repurposed wooden planks are lined up vertically, perhaps a door or a window. \\n\\nBankâ€™s short, coarse, grey hair is flecked with brown and tufts upward, in an even,  \\nwoollen-soft, textured frame around his face. A distinct hair line arcs across his forehead, slightly up and around the right side of his pale face, ending at the lobe of his large, right ear. Underneath thick eyebrows; textured like his hair, his blue eyes stare. \\n\\nBanksâ€™ nose is long and straight. His upper lip purses inside a fuller, lower lip. His slightly dimpled, full chin and the folds of his neck are cradled by two, layered, open high collars, each with two, gold buttons. They reveal a snug-fitting white, collared undershirt. \\n\\nThe rest of his white shirt is covered by a long, cream waistcoat. The high collar of his Naval jacket is red, thick and felted, a horizontal band of embroidered gold tapering to the collarâ€™s upturned, front edge. \\n\\nDown Banksâ€™s front, two of the 10 buttons of his jacket hold the fabric together at his chest, it splits wide at his front, allowing for the spread of his middle. \\n\\nEach large, circular, jacket button marks the end of a embroidered, gold, horizontal band of embellishment. These descend uniformly from the red collar down the length of the navy , red and gold jacket, a contrast to the cream, white and earthy tones of his waistcoat, shirt and surrounds. A large, decorative, 8-pointed silver star rests on the left breast of his jacket. This star and a strip of pale, red sash peeking out near his collar, signify Banks membership within the prestigious Order of Bath. \\n\\nHis leans his elbow on a wooden desk, three matching gold bands precede a red and gold cuff. Under his elbow other papers curl off, and to the right of the image. \\n\\nIn his left hand he holds a sheet of paper with pale blue markings, like that of a map. The surface of the paper reveals a play of light; bright from the top and fading to a dull, soft shadow at the lower edge of the frame. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Meredith Hughes and voiced by Rory Walker**",

Consequently, he also became a target for satirists who mocked his botanical interests and social eminence. James Gillray portrayed Banks as a â€˜Bath Butterflyâ€™ in 1795, the year he was made Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. In Gillrayâ€™s cartoon Banks is characterised as a crawler, inferring that he had been transformed from a caterpillar to a butterfly through continued, undeserved royal favouritism. Like Gillray, Ross joins a lineage of artists who have lampooned people in positions of power. The new video animation Ross created for this exhibition, displayed in this room, references these caricatures by James Gillray and Matthias Darly.",

I have been well acquainted with him for many years and he proposed to me to go with him at his expense. I thought that such an offer and such an opportunity should not be turned down. We therefore made an application together to the King of England to obtain a passage on the ship, which was so well received by the government that the captain was ordered to give us the best cabins and to receive as well three draughtsmen and six hands who all belong to Herr Banks. The ship was called _Endeavour_, the captainâ€™s name is James Cook.\\n\\nOur intention is to sail around the southern point of the Magellanic land that is called Cape Horn and from there make our course through the South Seas to a big island that was discovered three years ago. It is inhabited by a very kind-hearted, civilized and well-shaped people. There we plan to perform our astronomic observations and maybe stay four to six months. If afterwards our ship and crew are in a good state, I believe we will try to see if there are no unknown countries left for us to discover. Our shipâ€™s name alludes to that Endeavour meaning Attempt. We will probably not return home before 1771. And if Mr Banks then is in the same spirit as now to follow up his studies of natural history we will probably directly undertake together a journey to Sweden.\\n\\nI hope when we return to Europe our ship will surely be the richest in Natural Curiosities, for Mr Banks spares himself no expense.",

Arriving in London from Sweden in 1760, Solander became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1764 and began cataloguing plants at the British Museum. Not long after, he became known to Joseph Banks, and in 1768 he and Banks together applied to the King to obtain berths on James Cookâ€™s Endeavour. Having barely survived the dysentery that killed many of the Endeavourâ€™s crew, Solander returned to England to be fÃªted along with Banks for his scientific achievements. When Banks withdrew from Cookâ€™s second voyage, Solander followed suit; the pair went to Iceland and the Western Isles before Solander settled into the role of Banksâ€™s librarian and curator in London. Though he produced some significant treatises â€“ including the first scientific account of the kangaroo â€“ he gained a reputation for partying at the expense of cataloguing specimens. He grew corpulent and became a target for satire, and his scientific achievements went largely unrecognised in his lifetime. The first bookâ€“length biography of Solander was published in 1998.",

I have been well acquainted with him for many years and he proposed to me to go with him at his expense. I thought that such an offer and such an opportunity should not be turned down. We therefore made an application together to the King of England to obtain a passage on the ship, which was so well received by the government that the captain was ordered to give us the best cabins and to receive as well three draughtsmen and six hands who all belong to Herr Banks.

We walked until we completely tired ourselves, seeing by the way only one Indian who ran from us as soon as he saw us.\\n\\nThe soil wherever we saw it consisted of either swamps or light sandy soil on which grew very few species of trees, one which was large, yielding a gum â€¦ but every place was covered with vast quantities of grass. We saw many Indian houses and places where they had slept upon the grass without the least shelter; in these we left beads, ribbons etc. We saw one quadruped about the size of a rabbit. My greyhound just got sight of him and instantly lamd [sic] himself against a stump which lay concealed in the long grass. We also saw the dung of a large animal that had fed on grass which much resembled that of a stag; also the footsteps of an animal clawed like a dog or wolf and as large as the latter.\\n\\nMay the second. The morn was rainy and we who had got already so many plants were well contented to find an excuse for staying on board to examine them. In the afternoon however, we returned to our old occupation of collecting, in which we had our usual good success. Tupia, who strayed from us in pursuit of parrots, of which he shot several, told us on his return that he had seen nine Indians who ran from him as soon as they perceived him.\\n\\nMay 3. Our collection of plants was now grown so immensely large that it was necessary that some extraordinary care should be taken of them. I carried all the drying paper, nearly 200 quires of which the larger part was full, ashore and spreading them upon a sail in the sun kept them in this manner exposed the whole day, often turning them. By this means they came on board at night in very good condition.",

Arriving in London from Sweden in 1760, Solander became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1764 and began cataloguing plants at the British Museum. Not long after, he became known to Joseph Banks, and in 1768 he and Banks together applied to the King to obtain berths on James Cook's Endeavour. Having barely survived the dysentery that killed many of the Endeavour's crew, Solander returned to England to be fÃªted along with Banks for his scientific achievements. When Banks withdrew from Cook's second voyage, Solander followed suit; the pair went to Iceland and the Western Isles before Solander settled into the role of Banks's librarian and curator in London. Though he produced some significant treatises - including the first scientific account of the kangaroo - he gained a reputation for partying at the expense of cataloguing specimens. He grew corpulent and became a target for satire, and his scientific achievements went largely unrecognised in his lifetime. The first book-length biography of Solander was published in 1998.",

I have been well acquainted with him for many years and he proposed to me to go with him at his expense. I thought that such an offer and such an opportunity should not be turned down. We therefore made an application together to the King of England to obtain a passage on the ship, which was so well received by the government that the captain was ordered to give us the best cabins and to receive as well three draughtsmen and six hands who all belong to Herr Banks. The ship was called _Endeavour_, the captainâ€™s name is James Cook.\\n\\nOur intention is to sail around the southern point of the Magellanic land that is called Cape Horn and from there make our course through the South Seas to a big island that was discovered three years ago. It is inhabited by a very kind-hearted, civilized and well-shaped people. There we plan to perform our astronomic observations and maybe stay four to six months. If afterwards our ship and crew are in a good state, I believe we will try to see if there are no unknown countries left for us to discover. Our shipâ€™s name alludes to that Endeavour meaning Attempt. We will probably not return home before 1771.

They became friends who dined together with others of Londonâ€™s intellectual world such as Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke. \\n\\nBanks in Reynoldsâ€™s portrait is more assured than he is in Westâ€™s. Half scientist, half adventurer, the subject appears at a scholarâ€™s desk, just about to rise up out of his chair. With background sea and globe in evidence, the action due to occur is clearly maritime in nature. The writing below Banksâ€™s left hand confirms it: cras ingens iterabimus aequor; â€˜tomorrow tempt again the boundless sea.â€™ Banks never did return to the Pacific, but he acted as Maiâ€™s chief patron when the Raâ€˜iatean arrived in 1774, and, as President of the Royal Society, became the most vocal advocate for the British colonization of Australia.",

Having returned in 1771 from his voyage with Cook to the Pacific, he was often consulted as British plans for global expansion took shape. From 1788 to about 1810, though Banks held no official post, he was effectively head of Australian affairs in Britain. Meanwhile, in 1788 he co-founded the African Society; up to 1817 the Society funded several expeditions to chart the course of the Niger, Banks taking a lead role as a consequence of his connections at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. George Dance the Younger was City of London Surveyor and Architect from the age of 27, responsible for the new Newgate Prison and St Lukeâ€™s Hospital for Lunatics, amongst many other structures. However, after 1798 he concentrated on chalk portraits of his friends, including James Boswell, Horace Walpole, Hester Thrale, Joseph Haydn and Sir Robert Smirke. William Daniell spent many years translating Danceâ€™s portraits of eminent characters into soft ground etchings; 72 of Danceâ€™s portraits were engraved and published for popular sale between 1808 and 1814.",

His largely self-taught expertise in botany earned him fellowship into the Royal Society at the age of 23. At 25, he convinced the Society to send him as a naturalist with Cook's first Pacific voyage. Banks funded the additions of two other naturalists, two artists, a secretary, and two black servants. During the voyage he collected hundreds of specimens of flora and fauna, relying frequently on Indigenous interlocutors to understand what he was observing. Upon the Endeavourâ€™s return, it was Banks more than Cook who symbolised Pacific voyaging to a newly fascinated British public. Banks quarrelled with the Admiralty over his accommodations for the second voyage, pulling out of it at the last minute. Possibly regretful of his tempestuous stand, Banks hungered for every detail of the voyage when it returned in 1774 and was delighted to take over responsibility for Mai from the Admiralty. \\n\\nThe Royal Academy's 1773 exhibition featured portraits of the highly-topical Banks by Joshua Reynolds and the American-born Benjamin West. West's portrayal included the young scientist draped in a cloak of New Zealand flax with Oceanic souvenirs and Sydney Parkinson's drawings all about him.",

My grandfather/Christopher's great-great-grandfather's journey into the Northern Territory over a century ago is reflected in this portrait. It is a gift to share Christopher's life and I learn from him every day â€“ blood/memory. Marntaj.",

This double bind of a figure conspicuously produced for the lens yet unable to be seen â€“ hiding in plain sight â€“ reflects my interest in the potential for queer representational in/visibility in which subjects are empowered to pass before the camera un/seen.",

She groups images into constellations, with each project combining photographs that may have been taken decades apart. Each cluster map networks of kinship, from her friends and chosen family in her adopted home of Australia to family back in Germany. While very few of her photographs are straightforward portraits, with a face front on and lit for legibility, Koenning's entire practice can be thought of as a pursuit of portraiture, defined through moments of exchange and communal experience. In many of the photographs that appear here, bodies are caught mid-motion, some more eruptive than others. There are children on a trampoline, another upside down on a chair with legs akimbo, but there are also furtive glances, out a car window, or through dappled light, which trace action that is far more subtle.\\n\\nTaken together, these photographs convey a dense entanglement between Koenning and the people of her world. Her photographic practice is relational; she aggregates an archive of love, intimacy and connection that is always in flux. In one photograph, two tiny bodies cram themselves into a single hoodie. A sweet, if oblique, nod towards Koenning's enduring drive to make work in close fellowship with those around her.",

It features photographs taken over a five-year period in her birthplace of Kavi Nagar, in the northwestern Uttar Pradesh city of Ghaziabad in India. Several photographs here derive from that book, while others were taken on more recent visits. In what has become an ongoing portrait of familial connection, Kumar records the muted rhythms of life in the house her grandfather built in the 1980s. Working with a medium-format camera, which pulls incidental details into clear focus, Kumar catalogues the everyday objects and quiet corners that have been shaped by generations. The portraits that structure the sequence feature family members in moments of rest and private ritual. A grandmother naps, an uncle waits as the henna he uses to dye his hair sets. Time feels suspended, and the fabric that drapes across surfaces, both beds and bodies, only amplifies the stillness.\\n\\nKumar's project will evolve into the future, but is indelibly entrenched in the past and in the anticipatory loss that comes with the passage of time: 'When I started taking these photos, it was about discovery and learning â€¦ but it's now more about the slow process of saying goodbye â€¦ I'm focusing on grief, in a way, and how we make sense when people go â€“ through the possessions they leave behind, the house they lived in. Iâ€™m interested in how we use ritual and religion to make sense of the world after weâ€™ve lost someone.'",

A body leans against the gauze-like fabric of a curtain, casting a shadowy silhouette; a newborn's arm grasps the gold chain that hangs around his mother's neck; the palm of a hand splays in front of the camera, mysteriously illuminated. These photographs, stilled scenes that the artist documented before and after the birth of her son, hang in a neat line atop an image that has been blown up into an unruly wallpaper. It is a portrait of the artist herself, her body collapsed on a chair in exhaustion, taken from the footage recorded by a baby monitor. In the interplay between the photographs, we witness both a zoom in and out, a pull back and a holding close, that approximates the coiled experience of motherhood, at once claustrophobic and expansive.\\n\\nAng describes those compressed, early days with her son: 'Your world begins to shrink, to coalesce into the tight sphere of domestic life. What was once the sun is now the light in your living room. What was once the road, becomes the hallway to the bathroom. Everyone you once knew, becomes the squalling baby in your arms, suddenly unknowable, inconsolable and opaque in their needs and wants.'",

In a book, much like an exhibition, connections can be drawn between images, and narratives can be teased out across a sequence. These books, made by the artists featured in _if only we could take the time_, are key examples of the form. Their practices intersect with Jerrems in their mutual commitment to storytelling, but also in more subtle gestures and motifs: a mirror features in Koenning's work, a loose echo of Jerrems' own; photographs appear within photographs in Kumar's work as they do in Jerrems'; and the elegiac moon, shot through a hospital window in Jerrems' final series, is a perfect toenail in Ang's installation.",

It is Caroline Sladeâ€™s (b. 1969) fourth birthday, and her party dress very nearly, but does not quite, match the floral wallpaper. Her pose and gaze are detached and reserved while most other portraits in the book are celebratory. From the contact sheet for this photo shoot (which is included in the exhibition), we know that Slade was happy and playful during the session. In deliberately selecting this shot, with its hesitant pose and rather flat composition, Jerrems softly alludes to the awkwardness of girlhood or perhaps even the precarity of female agency in Australia at this time.",

This appointment, and the others that followed, signalled photographyâ€™s ascendance as a serious artform in Australia. \\n\\nMelanie Le Guay (1951â€“1975), seen in the background, is the daughter of fashion photographer and critic Laurence Le Guay, who would later include Jerremsâ€™ _Vale Street_ in the publication _Australian Photography, a contemporary view_ in 1976. Prior to Melanieâ€™s tragic death in 1975, she exhibited alongside Jerrems at the Australian Centre for Photography, in what were potentially the first concurrent solo exhibitions by women photographers in Australia.",

Icons of Australian fashion, their style eschewed trends and instead drew on local and international art and culture through exuberant shapes and colours. \\n\\nIn the photograph, Jackson, another Prahran Technical College alumna, greets the camera in her â€˜70s peaked hat and high-waisted summer outfit, while Kee speaks on the telephone in the background, her hand casually resting in her blazer pocket. Between the indoor plant, the racks of patterned clothing and the sculpted swan, there is a dynamism and playful ebullience in keeping with the fashion that Jackson and Kee pioneered.",

The Richard Avedon print, framed and hung on the wall in this photograph, is from 1967 and shows a disaffected Monroe, dazed after a long and taxing photo shoot. Several photographers have noted that Monroe would expertly perform during shoots but often collapse and retreat once they ended. It is telling that, in compiling photographs for _A book about Australian women_, Jerrems chose to include an image that does not feature an Australian woman, but highlights the performances that women are taught to put on for others.",

She meticulously arranged her photographs, both in publications and exhibitions, to evoke specific moods and associations. â€˜Please look at them, I have printed and arranged them, for you,â€™ she noted in a 1975 artist statement.\\n\\nTo plan these arrangements, Jerrems used small prints cut from her contact sheets. Contact sheets provide a record of every photograph from a roll of film and are produced by laying negatives directly on photographic paper before exposure and development in the darkroom. Jerrems often disrupted the indexical nature of the contact sheet by combining strips from different rolls, sometimes excising images, for the purpose of planning her hangs but also to introduce pauses and other narrative devices. Jerrems considered some of her sheets to be artworks themselves and exhibited them alongside her enlarged photographs.",

While the tone differs, this photograph has compositional similarities to the portrait of Evonne Goolagong Cawley and other iconic Jerrems works, with the figures spotlit against shadowed backgrounds, pulling the focus towards the subtleties of expression and body language. Aptly, both Thancoupie and Johnson are themselves deeply attentive to the dynamic potential of gesture and three-dimensional form. Thancoupie remains one of the foremost figures in Australian ceramics, while Johnson is celebrated for establishing the National Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Association and co-founding Bangarra Dance Theatre.",

This approach not only highlights Jerremsâ€™ stylistic development and interest in reflections but also references Cossington Smithâ€™s own work, particularly her 1955 painting _Interior with Wardrobe Mirror_, which features mirrored wardrobe doors angled to reveal the garden outside.",

In 1964, Noonuccal published the poetry collection _We Are Going_, becoming a leading literary figure and international advocate for First Nations peoples. She returned home to Minjerribah in 1971, where she established the Noonuccal-Nughie Education and Cultural Centre at Moongalba.

Meandering and evocative, these texts, like the photographs themselves, oscillate between the personal and the particular, and the idea of the collective. \\n\\nHere, Fraser mucks about in a suburban Melbourne backyard, appearing relaxed with Jerrems, although their working relationship was not always straightforward. Her stance is guarded, but with her direct gaze she asserts herself as forthright and resolute. Rather than a portrait of Fraser as an individual, this sequence might be seen as a telling portrayal of the exchange that took place between photographer and writer over the course of the project.",

In this portrait, used on the cover of _A book about Australian women_, Piper engages easily with the photographer, relaxed in her stance, smiling and glancing beguilingly out of frame. The photograph on the back cover presents an abrupt contrast. Piper is still holding the sculpture but this time the globe is illuminated, casting her features in light from below. She does not smile, instead, her shadow looms behind her as she fixes a severe gaze towards the camera. This ominous ending to the book hints at the fact that, while the light might be on, women in Australia were not set for an uncomplicated future.",

In this interplay between the subjects, we can feel Jerremsâ€™ presence in the scene.\\n\\nYolngu dancer and award-winning actor Gulpilil performed in films such as _Walkabout_, _Storm Boy_, _Rabbit Proof Fence_ and the Yolngu-language _Ten Canoes_. Edols, a close friend of Jerrems and another Prahran alumnus, was the cinematographer on _In search of Anna_, directed by Jerremsâ€™ partner Esben Storm.",

While some of her portraits depict a version of masculinity that aligns with the toxic bombast of mainstream culture, steeped in aggression and menace, here she foregrounds tenderness. From a close vantage point, Jerrems frames this unnamed man in a tight crop. His eyes are closed, his face serene as light gently illuminates his left cheek from above. With hands clasped behind his head, he is caught in a moment of unguarded repose.",

His expression, characterised by his blank stare, slack jaw and a bandaged cheek, conveys a hint of the exhaustion, and perhaps even the trepidation, that lies beneath his tough exterior. \\n\\nJerrems exhibited several prints taken on the set of the movie, including those of Moir and also actor Judy Morris which appear later in the exhibition, during what would be her final exhibition at the Australian Centre for Photography in 1978.",

She anchors the centre of the scene but stands at a significant remove. It is as if she looks in on the image through a small distanced window.

Tight crops, reflected images and layered bodies recur consistently in Jerremsâ€™ portraits of the members of Skyhooks, suggesting that the backstage energy was as chaotic and performative as the band itself. \\n\\nKnown for their flamboyant costumes and makeup, Skyhooks rose to fame with their 1974 debut album _Living in the 70s_, which depicted young Australian life with a bluntness that shocked conservative audiences. Songwriter Greg Macainsh recalls Jerrems as quiet and patient when she photographed the band for _Skyhooks: Million dollar riff_, a publication she worked on with author Jenny Brown.",

Their defiant, deadpan scowls are topped by matching buzzcuts, and their outfits are a countercultural wink. Jerrems identifies them as Sharpies in the workâ€™s title although, by 1976, when the photograph was taken, a new generation of Sharpies had emerged who were increasingly labelled as â€˜skinheadsâ€™ by the media. \\n\\nBehind the pair is a campaign poster for Wiradjuri activist Bruce McGuinness (1939â€“2003), the rallying cry â€˜Itâ€™s our turnâ€™ spread across the image. This detail grounds the photograph in a moment of revolution and counterculture, but also one of complexity. It is unclear whether the couple stand in solidarity, apathy or something else altogether.",

This project, which only reached early planning stages, was encouraged by poet and activist Oodgeroo Noonuccal, whose portrait Jerrems made for _A book about Australian women._ \\n\\nAs Arrernte writer Celeste Liddle notes, â€˜Carol Jerrems captured a number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander figures and activists, together with our allies, in ways we have not typically seen. Many times, the portraits appear candid, relaxed, joyful and playful, yet nearly every person Jerrems photographed was, in some way, shape or form, engaging in acts of resistance.â€™",

She was their teacher, yet, transgressing boundaries, she spent many afternoons swimming, smoking and drinking with them down by the river, and photographed them over two years. Mark Lean, for example, was photographed almost compulsively, as is evident in Jerremsâ€™ contact sheets, and appears most famously in _Vale Street_ later that year.\\n\\nA variety of accounts acknowledge they were intimately involved but this photo exposes the complexity of their supposed relationship. Jerrems originally titled the work _The game of drawing straws_ (Lean is holding a straw in his clenched fist) but then crossed it out on an early print and wrote _Rape game_. At the same time, she also widely spoke about her violent experiences with the boys. Regardless, the age difference and power dynamics between teacher and student complicate and problematise the stories that remain. In later years, long after Jerrems had passed, Lean and Jon Bourke recalled that they were performing a kind of bravado for both Jerrems and the camera: â€˜she thought that we were bigger louts than we actually were â€¦ we were playing at being louts.â€™",

Their back is to us, they are not named in the title of the work, and they are distinctly separate from Jerrems, who sits upright, hands in her lap, looking at the camera. In the photograph of Campbell, Jerrems is positioned so she is reflected in the mirror, but here she is the focal point, with the mirror revealing nothing but the detritus of the room.",

Despite appearing in several photographs, Gailey was a reluctant sitter, quipping that: â€˜when I knew Carol best, she had a camera with her most of the time, so I used to spend most of my time trying to stay out of her way.â€™ \\n\\nIn the work simply titled Lynn, Gailey stands in the office in raking light, with shadows from a window frame cutting across her body, emphasising the gentle lean of her hip under her vintage dress. Her gaze is resigned and resistant at once, as though she is waiting for the photo shoot to be over. Jerrems was persistent and would usually continue a shoot until she got the frame that she wanted â€“ often just after the sitter was ready to give up.",

He encouraged his students, including Jerrems, to prioritise â€˜concern for the human conditionâ€™ over and above commercial viability.\\n\\nCox championed what he saw as Jerremsâ€™ immense talent, her courage and her unorthodox approach to life: â€˜I didnâ€™t see her as a woman from the suburbs of Melbourne. That didnâ€™t seem to make much sense. Carol would have thrived in the 1920s in Europe or Berlin.â€™",

In Juliet holding Vale Street, actor Juliet Bacskai, Jerremsâ€™ friend from Prahran Technical College, holds the newly famous photograph, perhaps in an attempt to reclaim the image as it is propelled into a realm of fame and recognition beyond the makerâ€™s control. Leaves wreathe the top corners of the photograph in a way that is reminiscent of _Vale Street_ itself, echoing both its composition and its sensibility. Here, another self-possessed woman is spotlit against darkness and stands with surety and purpose.",

It appears spontaneous and was likely made with a timer. Storm looks at Jerrems with a small, private smile, his distinctive profile creating some symmetry with the contours of her hair. Jerrems looks towards the camera, a heavy bag over her shoulder and a badge on her lapel that reads â€˜Youâ€™re among equalsâ€™, which was a popular Australian feminist slogan from 1975. It is an aspirational sentiment to bring to a burgeoning relationship.",

The only colour photograph in this exhibition, _Mirror with a memory: Motel room_ was made on the Gold Coast during the filming of Esben Stormâ€™s film, _In search of Anna_. It was on this trip that they ended their relationship. \\n\\nFor her self-titled 1978 exhibition at the Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney, Jerrems hung an actual mirror, framed identically, next to the print. The viewer couldnâ€™t look at this portrait of Jerrems and Storm, reflected back through the camera, without also seeing themselves. In an artist statement for the show, betraying the raw honesty of the work, Jerrems wrote: â€˜These Photographs Are Portraits, They Are Also Self Portraits and Mirrors.â€™",

This photograph captures Morris in sharp Queensland light â€“ dappled and fierce â€“ highlighting her windswept hair, direct gaze and defiant pose. There is a decisiveness to Morrisâ€™ expression and the turn of her head that seems considered but natural. Jerrems has caught a fleeting yet singular moment, avoiding forced formalism but embodying more than mere chance.",

A post-coital moment becomes post-op, and the soft light of the Gold Coast motel room is replaced with the uncongenial light of a hospital bathroom. Jerrems stands straight on to the mirror, her body bruised and suffering. While she navigates a love affair in the earlier photograph, Jerrems is now completely alone; something that she grappled with quite explicitly in diary entries: â€˜God, please help me? I am completely alone â€¦ In illness, one is made to face death, but we are all dying since birth.â€™",

By surrounding herself with pictures, and then immortalising them with her camera, Jerrems attests to how important images were to how she made sense of the world. \\n\\nA line from one of the poems Jerrems wrote at the time reads:\\n\\n_Death in the next room,_  \\n_nothing unusual, life goes on._",

Patients liberation! Iâ€™m not going to take this anymore. Iâ€™m going to fight.â€™\\n\\nIn this photograph, Jerrems captures that experience of exclusion but also the paltry sense of privacy that hospitals afford. It catches the moment hospital staff pull the curtain on a neighbouring bed, cutting off her view but never offering peace and quiet.",

In this work, however, the focus is on her face with its expression of steely determination, and perhaps even, tragically, hope.",

Because Jerrems never got the chance to define these final photographs, we are left to decide whether this haunting image is simply an incidental shot, or a profound reckoning with her place in the cosmos as she faces death. Looking back, as in so much of her work, the potential for allegory is resonant.",

                "content": "Bungaree (c. 1775â€“1830), voyager, navigator and diplomat, was among the most significant Sydney-area Indigenous leaders of the early colonial period. He arrived in Sydney from Broken Bay in the 1790s, soon becoming an intermediary between the Aboriginal community and the colonists. He made his first foray as a seafarer when he joined the _Reliance_ for a journey to Norfolk Island in 1798. In 1799, he travelled as far north as Bribie Island and Hervey Bay with Matthew Flinders, and in 1802 he sailed with Flinders again as a member of the _Investigator_ expedition, proving himself indispensable as a negotiator and for his knowledge of Aboriginal protocols. As a result of his participation in the _Investigator_ expedition, Bungaree reputedly became the first Aboriginal person to circumnavigate Australia. In 1817 he joined the surveying voyage along the southern coast of the continent led by Philip Parker King, who considered Bungaree 'sharp, intelligent', and 'of much service to us in our intercourse with the natives.' Governor Macquarie also valued Bungaree's skills as an intermediary and hoped that he would act as an example to his compatriots. To this end, Macquarie set aside land for Bungaree and his people at Middle Head, issuing them with farming equipment, clothing and a fishing boat to encourage the adoption of 'civilised' ways. Bungaree became well known for his wit and his practice of welcoming to his country ships entering Sydney Harbour. This, combined with the recognition of his standing in both communities, made him a favoured subject for portraitists and several early colonial artists created images of him. Augustus Earle's c. 1826 painting of Bungaree is among Australia's earliest portraits in oil on canvas, and Earle's lithograph of the painting is regarded as the first printed portrait produced in New South Wales. Bungaree died in Sydney in November 1830 after a long illness."

                "content": "Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (1926â€“2022) was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, who subsequently became King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Born on 21 April 1926 in London, she grew up there and at Windsor and was ten years old when the abdication of her uncle, Edward VIII, and her fatherâ€™s accession to the throne made her heir presumptive. Educated at home, the Princess was a Girl Guide and a Sea Ranger and began taking on public engagements at age sixteen. During the Second World War, when the Royal Family were looked to as champions of stoicism and resilience, she made her first broadcast on the BBC: a morale-boosting message to the many children evacuated from London during the Blitz. She was photographed tending to her vegetable garden at Windsor as part of the 'Dig For Victory' campaign; and in 1945 she joined the Auxiliary Territory Service, the women's branch of the British Army, rising to the equivalent rank of captain. In 1947, aged 21, she married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten â€“ the son of Prince Andrew of Greece and a great-great grandson of Queen Victoria â€“ who was created HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. She and her husband set out for Australia and New Zealand in 1952; on the way, in Kenya, Elizabeth received news of her father's death. She returned to England and was 27 on her coronation at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953, which was broadcast on the BBC to more than 20 million people around the world.\\n\\nDuring her reign Her Majesty was the Head of State of the United Kingdom and fifteen other Commonwealth countries. She was the first reigning British monarch to visit Australia, making sixteen visits here between her first in 1954 â€“ when she and Prince Philip took in 57 cities and towns between Hobart and Cairns in 58 days â€“ and her last, in 2011. She held weekly audiences with fourteen different British Prime Ministers (from Winston Churchill to Boris Johnson), spent time with all but one of the last fourteen sitting US Presidents (from Harry Truman to Joe Biden), and held meetings with seven different Popes. She was patron of more than 600 charities and organisations across the UK, attended hundreds of public engagements each year and undertook many historic overseas visits. A constant and enduring figure, she was widely respected for her unceasing commitment to her role â€“ which, along with her popularity, has been cited as a major contributing factor to the success of the No vote in the 1999 referendum on whether Australia should become a republic. In September 2015 she surpassed the record set by her great-great grandmother Queen Victoria to become Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch; and on the 70th anniversary of her accession in 2022 she became the first British monarch to mark a Platinum Jubilee.\\n\\nThroughout her 70-year reign, Her Majesty represented graciousness, humanity and stability during times of enormous social change. One of history's greatest women and one of the most significant and influential figures of the twentieth century, her death at the age of 96 on 8 September 2022 prompted mourning around the world, along with unanimous expressions of gratitude and respect for her decades of devotion to duty and public service."

I couldn't talk, I couldn't remember anything, you know I went into this kind of other zone, and completely overwhelmed that all of a sudden the Queen is there who is differentiated by blood. You know, more than just fame, but this woman has a bloodline that is different. And even though I'm not a royalist I was like â€˜Oh my godâ€™. Finally when I found my voice I just started babbling on but she was in a hurry. She was late. She had to go and host a lunch and I'd been told she doesn't really like being photographed. So she just wanted to get it over and done with. And sheâ€™s in front of the camera and Iâ€™m still talking. And then all of a sudden, the minder calls, â€˜two minutesâ€™. And I hadn't taken one roll of film. So he completely stitched me up. And then I just went into total panic. Took one roll. And at one point, I needed her to step to the left and I couldn't think of left. So I was down on my knee, hands and knees, trying to grab her ankles. Luckily, my husband stepped in and said, â€˜No, ma'am, Polly means step to the leftâ€™, grabbed me and got me back behind the camera. I mean, the whole thing was just a total kind of joke. And then she sees the floral background and she goes, â€˜Oh, I like thatâ€™. And also the ring flash was super bright. So by the time she left, she said, â€˜Oh, I think you've blinded meâ€™. And it's a miracle that I got two good photos, a miracle. And that really was the end of my portrait career. Interestingly, even though it was sort of like, probably the pinnacle â€“ I was commissioned by the palace, she's probably one of the most famous women in the world â€“ it kind of was almost like, well, I've done that. And I don't really need to keep doing it.",

                "content": "Trukanini (c. 1812â€“1876) is arguably nineteenth century Australiaâ€™s most celebrated Indigenous leader. A Nuennone woman and the daughter of Mangana, chief of the Recherche Bay people, Trukanini experienced the loss of her mother, sister and intended husband â€“ all as a result of white violence â€“ at a young age. Believing that she might be able to assist in protecting her people, in 1829 Trukanini joined the group of Palawa leaders associated with George Augustus Robinson, an evangelically-inclined free settler who'd been appointed to effect the removal of Tasmania's Aboriginal people to a mission station, Wybalenna, on Flinders Island in Bass Strait. Trukanini remained one of Robinson's most important companions throughout the course of his so-called 'Friendly Mission', the name given to a series of journeys conducted by Robinson between 1830 and 1835. Trukanini went to Wybalenna in 1835, but held to her traditional ways despite the expectation that the Aboriginal people there would adopt European customs and religion. She travelled with Robinson in 1839 to the Port Phillip district, where she later engaged with four others in raids against white settlers. She returned to Flinders Island in 1842; when Wybalenna closed in 1847, Trukanini was among the remaining residents relocated to Oyster Cove, a former convict depot south of Hobart and close to her traditional country. Trukanini died in Hobart in May 1876. As she had feared, her skeleton was stolen from her grave and later displayed at the Tasmanian Museum. The Tasmanian Aboriginal community eventually won the fight to have her wishes honoured: her bones were cremated on the 30th of April 1976 and the following day her ashes were scattered with due ceremony on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Trukanini was erroneously referred to during her lifetime and beyond as the â€˜last Tasmanianâ€™ â€“ a false notion attested to by the many descendants of her contemporaries still living in Tasmania today."

In 1829 Wurati decided to join the party associated with George Augustus Robinson (1788â€“1866), a free settler and lay preacher appointed to the position of â€˜Conciliator of Aboriginesâ€™ so as to effect the removal of Tasmaniaâ€™s Indigenous people to Flinders Island in Bass Strait. This strategy had been conceived by the colonial government, amidst escalating hostilities, for the supposed protection of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities alike. Accompanied by a group of Aboriginal leaders who acted as his guides and interpreters, Robinson conducted a series of expeditions â€“ collectively known as the Friendly Mission â€“ between 1830 and 1835, during which the surviving tribes were persuaded into exile. Wurati and his second wife, Trukanini, became Robinsonâ€™s trusted assistants, yet remained fiercely proud of their traditions and identity. Wurati refused to adopt European diet or dress and maintained traditional practices, such as the use of ochre and grease for his hair and beard, even while at Wybalenna â€“ the mission station on Flinders Island to which over one hundred Tasmanian Aboriginal people were eventually exiled. Many died there while waiting for the fulfilment of the promise that they would be allowed to return to their country. In 1839, Wurati was one of the fourteen Tasmanians who went to Port Phillip following Robinsonâ€™s appointment to the position of Chief Protector of Aborigines in the new colony. He died on his return journey to Wybalenna in July 1842."

It is the only centre of its kind in Australia, and one of the very few in the world that are able to undertake the weaving, by hand, of large-scale, contemporary tapestries for architectural locations. With an emphasis on collaboration with living artists and architects, the Workshop facilitates an understanding of tapestry as an innovative and experimental practice rather than just a traditional, technical, and creatively-subservient skill. Over its 45 years of operation, ATW weavers have created more than 500 tapestries in collaboration with artists including Brook Andrew, Sally Smart, Reg Mombassa, TextaQueen, John Olsen, David Noonan, Janet Laurence, Guan Wei, Nell, and Ginger Riley Manduwalawala; and from designs based on original works in various mediums including painting, photography, watercolour and collage. Among the ATW's many major public works are Sally Smart's _Eye Desire_ (2011), commissioned for the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne; _The games children play_ by Robert Ingpen, commissioned in 2009 in honour of Dame Elizabeth Murdoch's support of Melbourneâ€™s Royal Children's Hospital; the colossal tapestry designed by Arthur Boyd for the Great Hall at Parliament House, Canberra; JÃ¸rn Utzon's _Homage to Carl Philip Emmanuel Bach_ (2003) for the Sydney Opera House; the series of tapestries designed by Roger Kemp for Great Hall of the National Gallery of Victoria's St. Kilda Road building; and the seven-metre-wide tapestry, also by Robert Ingpen, created to mark the Melbourne Cricket Club's sesquicentenary. ATW tapestries are held in corporate and private collections here and overseas, and in major public collections including those of the National Gallery of Australia, the Australian War Memorial and the National Library of Australia. Currently, there are ATW tapestries on display at nine Australian Embassies around the world, and in 2020 Kaantju/Umpila artist Naomi Hobson was commissioned to design a tapestry for the Australian Embassy to Indonesia in Jakarta. The Workshop also provides resources for weavers, maintains a program of exhibitions and site visits, and in 2015 it instituted the international Tapestry Design Prize for Architects."

A painter, photographer and lithographer, Dalton had spent some time in America before coming to Australia in the 1850s, possibly in search of gold. He set up as portrait painter in Melbourne and by 1855 was in Sydney, specialising in works in pastel. In Sydney, Dalton attracted commissions from the city's most prominent families, his likenesses deemed so life-like as to be 'almost laughable'. In December 1858 he advertised his 'invention', the crayotype or crayongraph, a photograph coloured over with pastel. By June 1863 demand for his portraits far exceeded his capacity to supply them; by 1865 he had sold his business, which continued to operate under his name, and returned to England."

                "content": "Will Huxley grew up in the suburbs of Perth, Western Australia, and Garrett Huxley was raised on the Gold Coast, Queensland. After university, where they both studied photography â€“ Will at Edith Cowan University and Garrett at the Queensland College of Art â€“ the artists gravitated to Melbourne where they met in 2006. The pair soon began to collaborate as The Huxleys, combining their separate practices of photography, filmmaking and costume design, with performance as a key element. Inspired by the attention-grabbing and the outrageous, the artists embrace the glamourous, the absurd and the provocative and in doing so challenge convention; the Huxleys persuade their audience to consider notions of gender, social mores and non-conformity. The artists have become part of a contemporary cohort of collaborating duos, which includes the British pair Gilbert and George, and Australia's Charles Green and Lyndal Brown. The Huxleys continue to be in demand across the country and internationally, invited to work at the Art Gallery of South Australia, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Museum of Brisbane, National Gallery of Victoria, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Heide Museum of Modern Art, Arts Centre Melbourne, Australian Centre for the Moving Image, the Mona Foma festival in Tasmania and Sydney Contemporary. They were the inaugural 'Disrupters in Residence' at HOTA on the Gold Coast, and were included in a select group of Australian artists invited to participate in the City of Melbourne's UPTOWN. Internationally they have performed and exhibited in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Moscow and Berlin."

I've seen that in my own experience as a Muslim growing up in Australia, being perceived I was monstrous or criminal, and that's never aligned with how I believe I am and how I engage with the world.\\n\\nThe weretiger, I find really interesting. It's something I heard about when I was very young as a piece of Malay folklore, of people who shape shifted into tigers. One of their paws would be bigger or smaller than the rest of them. And there was a stuffed Sumatran tiger in the Perth museum. And one of the paws was bigger or larger than the other 3, and so we thought that maybe it was, in fact, a weretiger. And so, it's been part of my own history, that fascination, for a very long time.\\n\\nBut it's a mythology that exists through Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, China, all through the region of people who were shape shifters and who became tigers. Why I was interested in it for this particular project, was looking at that mythology, in that they were different to the way that I'd read about werewolves and things like that in European and North American history, where the weretigers would often live in communities, and often be practising Muslims and that sort of thing, but there would be villages of weretigers. But people were warned to be cautious of them and to not trust them because they would eat people, essentially.\\n\\nBut you would see them in the market, you would engage with them, but it was a particular family or a particular group of people that had sort of duplicitous intentions, you know, were capable of murder and cannibalism, I guess. So, I was interested in that perception of monstrosity, and that projection of monstrosity, on a group of people who would otherwise be identical to yourself. I find that interesting and how that relates to how we engage with different groups within our own society.",

                "content": "Stephanie Alexander AO (b. 1940), cook, restaurateur, food writer and philanthropist, has been a major influence on Australian food and culinary culture for 50 years. Growing up at Rosebud on the Mornington Peninsula, where her father ran a caravan park, Alexander gained an interest in food and cooking from her mother, 'a wonderful cook who was not just interested in recipes, but in the culture that inspired the dish.' She has also recounted tending the family's vegie patch as a child, guided by her much-loved grandfather. After completing her school education, Alexander trained as a librarian, and at age 21 she set off on international travels that included a formative period in France. In 1966, with her then husband, she established The Jamaica House, a Lygon Street eatery specialising in curries and other West Indian dishes. It closed after a couple of years, at which point Alexander joined the team at Mietta's in North Fitzroy. In 1976 she established Stephanie's, also in Fitzroy, which within a few years had earned the reputation as Melbourne's home of exceptionally good, classic French food. 'Its $12 menu came at a time when no one had heard of goat's cheese and ginger came in a tin', one account of Stephanie's states, 'yet Alexander was surprising guests with violet petals in sorbet, lemon verbena-scented fish and dried marigold flavouring fish soup.' In 1980 she relocated the business to a Victorian-era mansion in Hawthorn. During the restaurant's seventeen years of operation there, Alexander published her first six books, among them _Stephanie's Feasts & Stories_ (1988) and _Recipes My Mother Gave Me_ (1997). In 2001, four years after Stephanie's closed, Alexander teamed up with a group called Cultivating Community to create a gardening and cooking course at a Collingwood primary school. With assistance from various bodies, including the Victorian Government, the project expanded, such that by 2010 there were kitchen garden programs operating in forty primary schools around the state. Alexander founded the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation in 2004 to coordinate the program, which is committed to introducing 'food education to children during their learning years, in order to form positive food habits for life.' Following an injection of funds from the Commonwealth Government, the program was taken up interstate, and as of 2018 it was reported that over 1200 primary schools and early learning centres around the country were participants. For her groundbreaking (no pun intended) work with the Kitchen Garden Foundation, Alexander was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2010. Meanwhile, the self-described 'accidental chef' had published another seven books including _The Kitchen Garden Companion_ (2009) and _The Tuscan Cookbook_ (2003), co-authored with travel companion and fellow cooking legend Maggie Beer. Alexander published the memoir _A Cook's Life_ in 2010, and her 1996 tome _The Cook's Companion_ ranks alongside The Margaret Fulton Cookery Book as the bible of any self-respecting Australian kitchen."

Among his more enduring songs are 'I Go to Rio' and 'I Still Call Australia Home'. He also achieved success composing for other performers, co-writing such hits as Olivia Newton-John's Grammy-winning 'I Honestly Love You' and Christopher Cross' 'Arthur's Theme (Best That you Can Do)', which won best song at the 1981 Academy Awards. Allen played his final concerts to packed houses in Sydney in January 1992, just five months before his death. _The Boy from Oz_, a musical based on Allen's life and featuring his music, premiered in Sydney in 1998 and toured around Australia.

On graduation he won the drawing prize and the travelling scholarship.\\n\\nFrom 1973 to 1984 Amor lived in a cottage attached to the home of former National Gallery of Victoria director Daryl Lindsay and his wife Joan, author of _Picnic at Hanging Rock_, painting between carrying out odd jobs for the old couple. During this impecunious period he produced a series of cartoons attacking the Fraser government for the _Labor Star_ and the _Tribune_ and made series of drawings of labourers, construction workers and slaughtermen that were exhibited at the Trades Hall Gallery. \\n\\nFrom 1983 he began to paint more personal and emotionally charged works, often incorporating a haunting â€˜solitary watcherâ€™. Some of his brooding, shadowy paintings of suburban and inner Melbourne now number amongst the defining images of the city.\\n\\nAmor won the National Australia Bank Art Prize in 1988, and over the 1990s, awarded several art residencies, he worked in Barcelona, New York and London. By 1999 he had more than twenty solo commercial shows and several regional gallery survey shows to his name. That year, as Australia's first official war artist since Vietnam, he travelled to East Timor to document the devastated land and the reconstruction efforts of peacekeepers. The resulting works are in the collection of the Australian War Memorial. \\n\\nAmor shows regularly in commercial galleries in Melbourne and Brisbane and his paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures are in the collections of most major Australian public galleries.

The son of the shipping magnate and land developer George Fife Angas, he came to Australia from England in 1843 at his father's behest. His work over the next few years proved of such interest to people ignorant of the newly 'discovered' southern lands that he soon returned to present an exhibition in person to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In Piccadilly his works were complemented by Aboriginal and Maori costumes and implements, bird specimens, and a Maori orphan in native attire.

                "content": "James Angus, born in Perth, Western Australia, has consistently explored the complexities inherent in traditions of Western sculpture. The first museum exhibition of Angus's work at Sydney's Museum of Contemporary Art in 1992 surprised viewers with its resolute and conceptually rigorous interrogation of spatial dynamics, and its engagement with the processes of industrial production. In the late 1990s Angus produced a number of sculptural works that represented carefully chosen animals and objects. A life-sized yellow fibreglass rhinoceros, pink rubber giraffe, and painted bronze dodos evoked perceptual complexity and analysed assumptions of scale and form. The very specific nature of the subjects of Angus's sculptures reflected their rich cultural and semiotic capacities. In 1999 he made several sculptures of a basketball and soccer ball where the use of computer-assisted design techniques enabled the artist to apply physical forces theoretically in virtual space. A real basketball was scanned in 3D and reproduced inside the computer; a soccer ball was created mathematically using computer design. These simulations were then subjected to theoretical velocity and force, captured at the moment of impact with the earth after being dropped from the cruising altitude of a 747 jet airliner, and reproduced as sculptures cast in plaster and bronze."

From 1975 until 1999 he exhibited at Tolarno Galleries. In 1977, Arkley was awarded residencies in Paris and New York. He came to see no sense in the Australian preoccupation with paintings of the bush, when such a small percentage of the population engages with the bush itself. Henceforth, Melbourneâ€™s suburbs provided the inspiration and setting for his best known works, made over twenty years of experimentation in an immaculately-finished, psychedelic and incandescent airbrush style. Arkleyâ€™s suite of interiors, _The Home Show_, was exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1999. Afterwards, he travelled to London to plan an album cover for Australian musician Nick Cave, and then to Los Angeles for a sell-out show of his paintings. He married his long-time partner, artist Alison Burton, in Las Vegas before returning to Melbourne, where he died from an overdose a few days later. Major retrospectives of his work were curated by Monash University Gallery in 1991 and NGV in 2006; his art was included in the National Gallery exhibition _Federation_ in 2000 and _Fieldwork: Australian art 1968-2002_ at the NGVA in 2002. Arkleyâ€™s painting of Nick Cave was one of the National Portrait Galleryâ€™s first commissions and remains one of the Galleryâ€™s signature images. His works are held by the National Gallery and most state collections."

Working primarily in photography, video and textiles, Atem explores migrant narratives and postcolonial practices in the African diaspora, the relationship between public and private spaces, and the exploration of home and identity through portraiture.\\n\\nAtemâ€™s family emigrated to NSWâ€™s Central Coast from South Sudan in 1997 when she was six years old. Living in Melbourne since 2014, Atemâ€™s work speaks to her sense of belonging and connection to her community in Australia and beyond.\\n\\nIn her portraits, in which she often depicts herself, Atem pushes against the impact of ethnographic photography and the images that defined representation from the 19th century onwards. Instead, Atong looks to the studio portraiture of mid-20th-century African photographers such as Malick SidibÃ© and Seydou KeÃ¯ta, for whom the medium provided a powerful means of resistance.\\n\\nReferencing these photographersâ€™ dynamic and vibrant compositions, as well as South Sudanese Dinka culture, Atem extends a lineage of photographic work that celebrated their subjects and returned agency to them. As she has said, â€˜Iâ€™m interested in the moment in history when black people took the camera and chose to photograph ourselves for ourselvesâ€™."

So as a South Sudanese person, a Dinka person, we have a tradition of writing songs to tell stories. And beyond that, also a lot of our names are sort of ways to record history as well. My name Atong means like war, or it references war, because I was born during a time of war. And other people's names reference whatever kind of period that they were born in. So, there's this interesting thing where for me, culturally, history has always been embodied and has always been a participatory thing rather than, I don't know, something that happens after the fact. It's not about, say, if you get to write it, you get to sort of change it or whatever. It's more along the lines of just by existing, by having a name, by participating in a family, you are part of history, and your participation in that history will always be recorded.\\n\\nSo my interest is, like you know, how do I continue that history through my own photographic practice and arts practice. There's sort of for me an interest in figuring out how to combine the visual language of photography with the oral language of record-keeping in a Dinka tradition.\\n\\nI think for me as someone who uses primarily digital photography, it can often feel like the photographic object is separate to the practice of making photographic works because they can just sort of exist in the digital realm. But there is also for me such an importance to the printed photograph and that as a sculpture in its own right.\\n\\nI'm trying to think of ways to engage with that object outside of printing, framing, hanging. Because my relationship to photography or my relationship to photos, I should say, is photo albums. These objects that require participation and these objects that kind of have an emotional weight as well as a physical weight. And, you know, are designed to sort of exist as objects, and I find that really important and fascinating.",

Born Florence Wilson in Richmond, Melbourne, she gave her first public performance as Florence Fawaz (her stepfather's surname) in a Christmas pageant around 1910. Her stepfather was duly impressed and arranged for her to have tuition in piano and voice; in 1913, she won a number of prizes in the annual South Street Competitions in Ballarat. She studied under Madame Elise Weiderman at the Conservatorium of Music in Albert Street and then at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1919. She left Australia and, following a disappointing stint in the United States, made her London debut in early 1921 at the Albert Hall. Like her Richmond compatriot, Nellie Melba, she adopted a name honouring her homeland and as Florence Austral debuted at Covent Garden in May 1922, replacing another patriotically named soprano, Elsa Stralia, in the role of BrÃ¼nnhilde in Wagner's _Die WalkÃ¼re_. During the 1920s and 1930s she toured North America and Australia and made the first of many recordings. The quality and power of her voice lent itself to the Wagnerian roles that secured her reputation, but she also performed in operas by Verdi, Mozart, Puccini and others. By the end of the 1930s, however, Austral was increasingly afflicted by multiple sclerosis. With her husband, Australian flautist John Amadio, she returned to Australia after the war and in the 1950s took up a teaching position at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music in Newcastle. She retired in ill health in 1959 and was admitted to an aged care facility in Newcastle in the early 1960s. The Florence Austral Association paid for her care until her death in May 1968."

His first book of short stories, _Contemporary Portraits and Other Stories_, was published in England in 1975, and reissued in 1986 as _The Drover's Wife and Other Stories_. His first novel _Homesickness_ (1980) won the National Book Council Award and shared the Age Book of the Year Award; _Holden's Performance_ (1987) won the 1988 Victorian Premier's Award for fiction.

His subsequent novels include _The Pages_ (2008) and _The Voyage_ (2012). Bail's short fiction has been published regularly in journals such as _Meanjin_ and the _New Yorker_, and his output in non-fiction includes _Longhand: A Writer's Notebook_ (1989) and _Notebooks 1970â€“2003_ (2005).

At the age of twenty-five, he suggested to the council of the Royal Society that they recommend him for inclusion on the voyage of the Endeavour. With Daniel Solander, he collected hundreds of specimens of plants and animals of the South Seas, of which many are depicted in the volumes which have come to be known as Banks' Florilegium. One of the great stars of eighteenth century London, Banks was President of the Royal Society for more than forty years, from 1778 to 1820. His association with Australia far outlasted the voyage with Cook: it was he who recommended it as a site for a penal settlement; he was a patron of Matthew Flinders and others; and his keen interest in Australian natural history was sustained through correspondence with all the early governors of New South Wales. At one point, Carl Linnaeus suggested that the continent be named Banksia. From 1788 to about 1810, though Banks held no official post, his role as de facto head of Australian affairs was widely acknowledged. During this period, he was deeply involved in schemes to drain the fens around Revesby, his family seat in Lincolnshire, through a system of canals. As the fens dried up, great stretches of pasture became available and Boston sheep fair became a major venture. Banks thus became keenly interested in sheep, particularly merinos (the volume The sheep and wool correspondence of Joseph Banks runs to nearly 700 pages) and he was designated Groom of His Majesty's Spanish Flock. He was involved with the first public sale of the breed on 15 August 1804, at which John Macarthur made significant purchases for his property at Camden, New South Wales."

We walked until we completely tired ourselves, seeing by the way only one Indian who ran from us as soon as he saw us.\\n\\nThe soil wherever we saw it consisted of either swamps or light sandy soil on which grew very few species of trees, one which was large, yielding a gum â€¦ but every place was covered with vast quantities of grass. We saw many Indian houses and places where they had slept upon the grass without the least shelter; in these we left beads, ribbons etc. We saw one quadruped about the size of a rabbit. My greyhound just got sight of him and instantly lamd [sic] himself against a stump which lay concealed in the long grass. We also saw the dung of a large animal that had fed on grass which much resembled that of a stag; also the footsteps of an animal clawed like a dog or wolf and as large as the latter.\\n\\nMay the second. The morn was rainy and we who had got already so many plants were well contented to find an excuse for staying on board to examine them. In the afternoon however, we returned to our old occupation of collecting, in which we had our usual good success. Tupia, who strayed from us in pursuit of parrots, of which he shot several, told us on his return that he had seen nine Indians who ran from him as soon as they perceived him.\\n\\nMay 3. Our collection of plants was now grown so immensely large that it was necessary that some extraordinary care should be taken of them. I carried all the drying paper, nearly 200 quires of which the larger part was full, ashore and spreading them upon a sail in the sun kept them in this manner exposed the whole day, often turning them.

                "content": "Jimmy Barnes AO (b. 1956), singer/songwriter, is a solo performer and the former lead singer of the quintessential Australian pub band, Cold Chisel. Born in Glasgow, Barnes immigrated to Adelaide with his family at age five. At seventeen Barnes joined Cold Chisel, which had been formed by Ian Moss, Steve Prestwich and Don Walker in 1973. After five years performing around the country, the band released the strong-selling _Cold Chisel_ (1978). They followed up with _Breakfast at Sweethearts_ before hitting the mainstream with _East_ (1980), which went triple-platinum. Two more albums were followed by a tour of the UK and the USA in late 1982, but international success eluded the band. They announced their disbandment in August 1983; a final tour was filmed as _Last Stand_, and their 'last' studio album, _Twentieth Century_, was released in 1984 (they reformed to make another in 1998). Their many live albums, compilations and EPs have combined to make Cold Chisel the only Australian band to have sold more records after they broke up than when they were together. After leaving Cold Chisel, Barnes became Jimmy Barnes and has since released twenty solo albums including _Flesh and Blood_ (2021) â€“ thirteen of them reached number one, the most in ARIA chart history. His two bestselling autobiographies, _Working Class Boy_ (2016) and _Working Class Man_ (2017), were followed by a book of non-fiction short stories, _Killing Time_ (2020) and a children's book, _Rosie the Rhinoceros_ (2021)."

Many of Barton's intricate paintings are focused on women, often surrounded by an abundance of flowers, fruit and other symbols of femininity, fertility and motherhood. On the occasion of the opening of a major retrospective of her work at the National Gallery of Victoria in 2018, Barton said: 'My greater oeuvre always speaks to different ways of inhabiting a female body in all of its complexities.'\\n\\nBarton has been a finalist in the Archibald Prize five times and won it twice: first in 2008 for a self-portrait with her children, then in 2013 for her painting of the actor Hugo Weaving, which is one of her few male portraits. Although Barton is best known for her paintings, she also works with collage, sculpture, textiles and video. In 2022, Barton released her first feature film, _Blaze_, which she co-wrote and directed."

This back-to-basics philosophy earned the restaurant a devoted following and critical acclaimâ€”it won the Remy Martin Cognac/Australian Gourmet Traveller Restaurant of the Year Award in 1991â€”while quietly revolutionising the Australian food industry, encouraging a greater focus on local produce and rustic, regional cuisine.\\n\\nAfter Beer closed Pheasant Farm Restaurant in 1993, she launched her own brand, Maggie Beer, which produces pÃ¢tÃ©, jams, wines, vinegars, verjuice and dozens of other products that are sold in Australia and around the world.

In 2010, she received the Senior Australian of the Year award for her work educating Australians about what they eat.

A lot of other painters came back at the same time, so it was a very lively group, not by any means each one in agreement with the other, we had fantastic arguments about the why and wherefore of various theories. Everybody had to somehow earn their living, and it was rather a scramble but we did have a generous atmosphere amongst ourselves which perhaps doesnâ€™t exist in the same way today. When anybody did a good painting, whether you were a rival or not, or somebody was really not quite oneâ€™s friend, everybody went to look at the painting if everybody had come to the conclusion it was a very good painting. We regarded ourselves as a kind of brotherhood, sisterhood if you like, and watched each other with great attention and were glad when anybody got on better because it helped everybody else to get on better.\\n\\nOur friend Peter Bellew became art critic for the Sydney Morning Herald. I think then he had to do some naval work or other and could not go on with the art criticism so they asked my husband whether he would like to try his hand at writing art criticism for the paper. He immediately said, â€˜Oh, why donâ€™t you have my wife as art critic because she speaks the language and does writeâ€™, and the Herald said very charmingly and politely that they were not in the habit of employing women in this function as a critic, and couldnâ€™t contemplate the idea.",

And sometimes family members, including myself, and my husband Mike, who's often a collaborator, and our son Rali, who's also a creative collaborator, I will include them in my work in various ways. So it might be through portraiture, but sometimes\\n\\nas kind of like of a character, or cast as a role as a guardian figure as well. Yeah, so I guess that's kind of one way of embedding a sense of identity and family through my work.\\n\\nAnd then over time, there's been these recurring lucky symbols and motifs, and I guess the whole kind of aim or underlying thoughts are to do with ideas about kindred spirits, and good spirits for the world.\\n\\nLike I've always been interested in like stories, and particularly supernatural stories, and mythical figures. For instance, Rali has been a kind of supernatural acrobat spirit in one of the projects I've worked on previously, and Mike's been a kind of guardian figure.\\n\\nAnd then other figures that have sort of appeared as well, like re-workings of, or re-imagining figures like a gorgon figure, and fox spirit, or shape-shifter figures. And I guess that's kind of mixed with the idea of identity being fluid, and shape-shifting and in-between spaces.",

In 1971 he was voted News Photographer of the Year, but three years later he began work at the new Department of Aboriginal Affairs, travelling the country to document Aboriginal social history. It was in this role that he took his iconic 1975 photograph of then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam pouring a handful of earth into the hand of Gurindji Elder and traditional land owner, Vincent Lingiari. In 1979 he returned to work at the _Herald_. From 1986 he has worked as a freelance photographer and lecturer. His retrospective exhibition, _In Dreams: Mervyn Bishop, Thirty Years of Photography 1960â€“1990_, initially curated by Tracy Moffatt, toured for a decade. He worked as a stills photographer on Phil Noyceâ€™s film _Rabbit Proof Fence_ (2002), and was awarded the Australia Councilâ€™s Red Ochre Award in December 2000. A major retrospective at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2017, _Mervyn Bishop_, combined his photojournalism and art works with the family photographs he took around Brewarrina in north-west New South Wales as a young man and on return visits. The exhibition later toured around Australia."

They finally married in 1953 after which she often travelled with her husband to tropical regions where she painted the local people. Black's major contributions were in the prevention and control of malaria in the armed forces, in Australia and in developing countries, working in conjunction with the World Health Organisation (WHO). He eradicated malaria from the Northern Territory, Cape York and the Torres Strait Islands in 1962 - the area was officially declared to be malaria free by WHO in 1981. Black became a consultant for WHO and devoted the rest of his working life to preventing and eradicating malaria. He is the only Australian to have been awarded the Darling Foundation Medal and Prize by WHO for his work in the control of malaria."

He was a signatory to the _Antipodean Manifesto_ (loosely, a defence of figuration against abstraction) in the early 1950s. After he won the Helena Rubinstein Scholarship in 1960, his work was shown in the important Whitechapel and Tate exhibitions in London in 1961â€“1962. Exhibiting prolifically throughout his career, over the 1970s he produced softer images of cats and gardens.

But it was not really a sort of disciplined thing, it wasnâ€™t really a thought-out thing. It was a thing where it was chasing a substance, it was kind of style chasing a substance. Once the substance was realised in some sort of sense, then the operative thing was to make it function properly, make it function fully. Itâ€™s like, sort of, driving a little baby Austin, finally you become a mature enough driver to be able to run an E-type Jag or a very complex piece of machinery. You have the emotional equipment realised, but it is then to make it a public fact, it is then to make it kind of articulate, a real articulate message in plastic terms, that is, it must be, the feeling must be couched properly in paint, the image must be embedded properly in the paint, must be trapped, as Francis Bacon says very well, in the paint.\\n\\nWell, now I work not so haphazardly, get up very early in the morning, go to the studio, clean up all the brushes, tidy up the room, sweep the floor and start working in a very detached sort of way, and work through disinterest to interest, or work, labour, very long hours on making a painting function within itself in a fairly detached sort of way. But this only could have been done by this kind of organic growth of the personality, it couldnâ€™t have been done in the artificial sense, you canâ€™t outside impose thoughts, they have to grow.",

She became a member of Brisbane's literary circle, joining the writers' group _Barjai_, which included Judith Wright and Thea Astley. In 1950 she was diagnosed with optic atrophy, and was declared blind by the age of 22. 'It seemed to me I was given a life sentence for a crime I had not committed,' she wrote in her 1997 biography _Glass after Glass_. Moving to Sydney to study, she met artist Charles Blackman. After they married in 1952, they moved to Melbourne, where they associated with the avant-garde group centred around the Melbourne Contemporary Art Society: Arthur Boyd, Fred Williams, Joy Hester, John and Sunday Reed, Clifton Pugh, John Perceval, Len French and Mirka Mora among others. In the 1960s the Blackmans were part of the Australian Push active in London. Long-term muse to her husband (they divorced in 1978), she appeared in many of his paintings including his 1956 series _Alice in Wonderland_, and modelled for their artist friends. Blackman also worked as a magazine columnist and a radio-producer for Radio for the Print Handicapped, and helped form the National Federation of Blind Citizens. She interviewed hundreds of people for the National Library of Australia's oral history program. Blackman published _Portrait of a Friendship_, which drew on her correspondence with Judith Wright, in 2007. A documentary about her life, _Seeing from Within_, was released in 2017."

But somehow what his creations came out of â€“ a sort of a living or understanding of poetry â€“ was something that always bound us and still binds us together. But at that time when I recognised Charles as potentially a very great painter and a great creator, I relinquished my strong intentions of being a writer and although I went on writing diaries and sometimes poems and more and more I became a very prolific letter-writer as I gathered more and more interesting people as friends and we became more and more separated by distance, my writing changed course, as in fact my life had changed course to become devoted to Charlesâ€™ optimal putting forward of himself as a painter.\\n\\nYou know, when we married I said, â€˜Well if youâ€™re going to be a painter, youâ€™re going to paint, youâ€™re not going to go out and get a job doing something or another,â€™ so he stayed home and painted. And by this time my eyesight had failed almost altogether and I was on a blind pension, so we had that as a basis to live on. And the only thing I could really do was to work as an artistâ€™s model, as a nude model, which in fact I quite enjoyed because I was picking up a lot of information about painting. Itâ€™s quite an elegant job in its way, being a model, because one can decide oneâ€™s own poses and itâ€™s a very private occupation. One can have oneâ€™s own thoughts and one has the satisfaction of knowing oneâ€™s doing a job well.",

When Marjorie Lawrence visited Brisbane on a concert tour in 1944, she urged him to take his singing further. In March 1945 he sang on _Australia's Amateur Hour_ and gained a record number of votes. Rejected elsewhere, he was finally accepted by the Melbourne (Melba) Conservatorium of Music, gaining his diploma in 1949. Having scraped up the means to study in New York, he performed in a benefit concert in the New York Town Hall in early 1951; some months later, he appeared as a guest artist for the ABCâ€™s Jubilee Tour of Australia. Returning to Melbourne, he worked in a department store and in 1956 began to teach part-time at the conservatorium. After spending 1959 in Europe, he became the proprietor of a service station and later of a milk bar. A member of the Aboriginesâ€™ Welfare Board in Victoria in the late 1950s, Blair was also involved in the Aborigines Advancement League, the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the Commonwealth Aboriginal Arts Board and initiated the successful Aboriginal Childrenâ€™s Holiday Project. In 1964 he stood to no avail as Labor candidate for Mentone; three years later he began work as a school music teacher. In 1973, three years before he died, he won praise for his performance in the opera _Dalgerie_, at the Sydney Opera House."

Aged sixteen, he joined the Royal Navy, and six years later he was appointed to accompany Cook's third voyage as Master of HMS Resolution. Bligh's main task was to make charts, and on the voyage he honed the navigational skills that would become - along with volatility and authoritarianism - his best known characteristics. Subsequently promoted to Lieutenant, he served in the West Indies before being appointed commander of the Bounty. The Bounty left England in December 1787 to collect breadfruit from Tahiti, which it reached 11 months later. Soon after leaving the island, in April 1789, the Bounty's crew, led by the second-in-command, Fletcher Christian, mutinied. Bligh and eighteen supporters were set adrift in an open boat with minimal provisions and no maps, but he successfully navigated over 3000 miles to Timor, during the voyage charting part of the coast of Australia. On his return Bligh was honourably acquitted by a court martial, while three of the ten mutineers brought to trial in England were hanged. For Bligh, the upshot of the mutiny was a reputation for tyranny, which would continue to disrupt his career. Through Sir Joseph Banks, Bligh was appointed Governor of NSW, coming to the post in August 1806 with a brief to curb the trade in rum and the influence of powerful, wealthy colonists. Again, despite his general integrity, Bligh's abrasive manner and rigid adherence to orders created conflict over issues such as land, town planning and convict labour. These led ultimately to Australia's first and only military coup, the 'Rum Rebellion' of January 1808, wherein Bligh was deposed by the NSW Corps. He was held under house arrest in Sydney for more than a year; his replacement, Lachlan Macquarie, did not arrive to take up the Governorship until December 1809. After returning to England, Bligh was eventually promoted to Vice Admiral. He died in London, survived by his six daughters."

                "transcript": "I am now unhappily to relate one of the most atrocious acts of piracy ever committed. Just before sunrise, Mr Christian and the master at arms and several officers came into my cabin while I was fast asleep, and seizing me, tied my hands with a cord and threatened instant death if I made the least noise. I called sufficiently loud to alarm the officers, who found themselves equally secured by sentinels at their doors. There were now three men at my cabin door and four inside. Mr Christian had a cutlass and the others were armed with muskets and bayonets.\\n\\nI was carried on deck in my shirt, in torture with a severe bandage around my wrists, where I found no man to rescue me. I asked the reason for such a violent act, but I was threatened to be put to death if I said a word. The boatswain was ordered to hoist the small cutter out, with a threat if he did not do it instantly to take care of himself. But on a representation that this boat was very leaky, he was directed to hoist the launch out. Mr Hayward and Hallet, midshipmen, and Mr Samuels, clerk, were now ordered into the boat. I assumed my authority and demanded the cause of such an order, endeavouring to bring someone to a sense of his duty, but it was to no effect. â€˜Hold your tongue sir, or you are dead this instantâ€™, was constantly repeated to me.\\n\\nI continued to endeavour to change the tide of affairs, when Christian changed the cutlass he had in his hand for a bayonet and holding me with a strong grip by the cord that tied my hands, he continued to threaten me with instant death if I did not be quiet. The villains around me had their pieces cocked and bayonets fixed and particular people were now called on to go into the boat and were hurried over the side. With those people, I concluded of course, that I was to be set adrift. I therefore in making another effort to bring about a change, expressed myself loudly in such a manner as to be saluted with â€˜blow his brains outâ€™.",

                "content": "Peter Booth (b. 1940) grew up in the English steel mill town of Sheffield, bike-riding on the nearby moors. He left school at 15 and from 1956 to 1957, attended evening drawing classes at Sheffield College of Art while working as a copyboy for a local newspaper. Drawing constantly, he began keeping a dream diary in 1973. In 1957, the Booth family immigrated to Australia, settling in the then semi-rural town of Altona. He attended the National Gallery School in 1962 finding an inspiring mentor in John Brack. Graduating in 1965, Booth went on to teach painting at Prahran Technical College from 1966-69, as well as teaching drawing part-time at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1967. Booth gained widespread recognition through the inclusion of his large architectural â€˜blockâ€™ paintings in The Field in 1968. From 1969-75, during which time he began keeping a dream diary, Booth worked in the Prints and Drawing section of the National Gallery of Victoria, becoming deeply impressed with the work of William Blake and Goya as well as the authors Tolstoy, Singer, Lessing, and Marquez. He followed the â€˜Blockâ€™ series with the â€˜Doorwayâ€™ series (1970-74). From the mid-1970s his work changed to vivid abstractions drawn from his dreams, featuring monstrous hybrid figures, circular motifs, and warped space. During the 1980s he continued to depict mutants, as well as solitary men who also appeared amongst crowds in other works. Around this time, he began his continuing incorporation of flakes of snow drifting over his figures and desolate landscapes. Booth is represented in all major Australian galleries; the Ian Potter Centre held an exhibition of 230 of his paintings in 2003."

                "content": "Polly Borland, born in Melbourne in 1959, began her photographic career in Australia before moving to London in 1989. Since then she has established an international reputation as a leading portrait and reportage photographer. She has also shot movie stills and 'specials' for the films _Dogs in Space_, directed by Richard Lowenstein, and _Ghosts of the Civil Dead_ and _To Have and to Hold_, both directed by her husband John Hillcoat. Her first book, _The Babies_, a photographic study of infantilists (adults who derive sexual pleasure from acting or being treated as babies), was released in December 2000. Joint winner of the 1994 John Kobal Photography Portrait Award, Borland's work has featured in exhibitions in Australia and the United Kingdom including the 1999 Meltdown Festival in London, the British National Portrait Gallery's display _Artists of the 1990s_ and _Glossy: Faces Magazines Now_ at the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra.  _Polly Borland: Australians_, an exhibition which is a collaborative project between the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra, and the National Portrait Gallery, London to celebrate the Centenary of Federation was shown in London and Australia in 2000-2001. Borland says that \"I have a fascination with people - I love meeting them and photographing them. It's a passion. I think of my camera like a microscope, regarding my sitters closely. On a good day it is more like a x-ray machine being able to penetrate below the surface. At its best portrait photography is psychologically revealing.\""

                "transcript": "There were all sorts of photos of Germaine through the years of her naked and, you know, in controversial poses. And anyway, I got there, and I think in the back of my mind I thought itâ€™d be great to get her naked, but I thought thereâ€™s no way sheâ€™s going to do that. And sheâ€™s still beautiful, very Amazonian kind of woman. Every time I went somewhere to photograph, I tried to look for the most simple area in the house. Nothing really appealed to me and then I went into her bedroom, and she said â€˜Oh well of course you can photograph me in hereâ€™ and she said to Jenny my assistant â€˜Well of course Iâ€™d never be clothed in my bedroom; Iâ€™d have my clothes off.â€™ And so Jenny came through to me and she went â€˜She wants to take her clothes offâ€™ and Iâ€™m like, wow, Iâ€™ve thought Iâ€™ve hit the jackpot, this is amazing. It was her idea, not mine, she took her clothes off, sheâ€™s happy to do it, totally consensual.\\n\\nThe Sun or one of the tabloid English press got a hold of the picture and published it. And she said â€˜Well I want to give it to The Sun for the page three girl section which was the notorious boobs, naked breasts. But at that point we were suing the other tabloid newspaper for using the photo without my permission. So we couldnâ€™t then let The Sun use it even though that would have been really funny. So we said â€˜Look, no, we canâ€™t do it.â€™ And she was the one from wanting us to give it to The Sun or sell it to The Sun or whatever. So I think she got a little bit annoyed that we said no we canâ€™t do that because itâ€™s going to take away from the court case. Anyway, and then the next time I read anything that she said about the photo sheâ€™s completely slamming the photo. So like, you know, itâ€™s awful, itâ€™s this, itâ€™s that, you know, she manipulated me. And I just thought, â€˜Oh I canâ€™t be bothered with this.â€™",

She left Adelaide in 1914 to live in England and France for the rest of her life. Over the course of a nine-year relationship with the English writer Ford Madox Ford she painted many portraits of their friends, including Aldous Huxley, Edith Sitwell, Gertrude Stein and TS Eliot. She achieved some success in the US, but she is best-known in Australia for the works of art she completed as an official war artist in Britain in World War II, particularly those depicting the actions of the Bomber Command and the return of prisoners of war from Germany. Many of these paintings are in the collection of the Australian War Memorial, which mounted a major retrospective exhibition of Bowen's works in 2002. Bowen's autobiography, _Drawn From Life_, was published in 1941, and extensive public interest in the artist was sparked in 1999 with the publication of Drusilla Modjeska's _Stravinsky's Lunch_, a ruminative parallel biography of Bowen and Grace Cossington Smith."

Born in Murrumbeena, an outer suburb of Melbourne, Boydâ€™s mother and father, Doris and Merric, were artists, as were his paternal grandparents, Arthur Merric and Emma Minnie Boyd. He began making paintings as a boy and briefly attended night classes at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, developing a vigorous and expressive style. During the Second World War he was conscripted into the Cartographic Unit of the Australian Army. Although he did not see active service, the war inspired paintings depicting a grotesque and unbalanced world. During a trip to Central Australia in the 1950s he was shocked by the living conditions of Aboriginal people in Alice Springs, which resulted in his controversial series Love, Marriage and Death of a Half-caste. In the 1960s, living mainly in England, Boyd embarked on ambitious cycles of paintings based on biblical and mythological themes in Australian bush settings, and designed theatre costumes and sets. Returning to Australia in the early 1970s, he bought a property on the Shoalhaven River on the south coast of New South Wales, Bundanon, where he continued to paint landscapes. Also known for his philanthropy, Boyd made an immense gift of his own work to the National Gallery of Australia in 1975; in 1993 he generously gifted Bundanon to the Australian people."

But, I mean, you donâ€™t ever come out with anything fresh or marvellous, it always seems ghastly when it goes up on the wall, and maybe it is.\\n\\nI hope itâ€™s becoming less taped, or typed. Not meant to be a pun, but anyway, I think thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d prefer to be happening, that itâ€™s becoming just as much mine, if I can make it that way, but much less typed in the sense that it would be, well, â€˜thatâ€™s Australianâ€™, or â€˜that comes from Melbourne, that comes from Ballarat, thatâ€™s where â€¦â€™.

Also, I used to listen to the radio a lot, in fact one of my favourite games was playing with the frequencies of radios and seeing what kinds of statics and sounds I could pick up, and of course, short wave was just fantastic and I was able to often, during the evening, pick up neighbouring Asian stations and so on, and this music really excited me as a child. Whenever I heard music I was always drawn to it. I had to go and listen to it. At about the age of six, my sister sent me a recorder and a teach-yourself manual so, of course, I taught myself to play the recorder in a very short time. This again was something which was very important to me as a means of expression and I, in fact, started writing quite â€“ well, bizarre scores, really the notation of which meant nothing to anybody except myself, but I used to derive a great deal of enjoyment from playing these weird symbols that Iâ€™d managed to put down onto paper.\\n\\nPerhaps my attraction to the sound of shortwave and the static and so on that was created by the radio is a result of my trips by air, the first one of which I undertook as a small child at the age of two. The sounds of the engines of the plane even fascinated me, and the variation in the contrasting timbres and dynamics of what happened when you were actually up in the air. I think probably my fascination with sound of all kinds was a result of living in a silent or a comparatively silent environment in the country, and so therefore these sounds of the city, of machines, of planes, in my rare contacts with them, are all the more meaningful to me.",

What Iâ€™m interested in in painting is people, of course, principally, how they live, how they behave, how they get the faces they deserve, how they can bear to put up with a life which seems so curiously tragic.\\n\\nOf course I know that to be interested in peopleâ€™s behaviour for a painter is most impure. Itâ€™s called literary, and in our day nothing could be a greater sin than to be a literary painter; but now Iâ€™m old enough to feel that itâ€™s a waste of time to apologise for not painting in some other way, and the fact is that Iâ€™m still always fascinated by people and their behaviour. And yet at the same time, itâ€™s not enough to just paint pictures of ideas; at the same time we must put it into a visual form which is as complete as any abstract visual form. And here, thereâ€™s always a conflict between the demands of the idea and the demands of the form.\\n\\nAnd in any case, Iâ€™m always dubious about the remarks painters make about their own work, because what we so often say is rather what we would like to have done than what weâ€™ve really done.",

                "content": "Christopher Brennan (1870â€“1932), poet, was born to Irish parents in Sydney. A brilliant schoolboy, destined early for the priesthood, he gained a scholarship from Cardinal Moran and went to Riverview; there, he abandoned his vocation. As a language and classics student at Sydney University he edited Hermes, fell in love with Victorian poetry, graduated with a First and a University Medal, and lost his religious faith. After a short stint teaching at St Patrickâ€™s, Goulburn, he won a travelling scholarship to the University of Berlin, where he became convinced of the power of poetry to reclaim an ideal version of humanity. Returning to Sydney in 1894, he began cataloguing in the New South Wales Public Library, where he was to rise to second assistant librarian by 1907. Late in 1909 he was appointed an assistant lecturer in French and German at the University of Sydney. His poetic output â€“ complex and symbolic, always more European than Australian in sensibility - for the most part declined after 1902; his biographer Axel Clark suggests that the moderately successful pro-war poems he wrote during the First World War sprang from his hostility toward his German wife and mother-in-law. After he divorced, he embarked on an affair with a younger woman; her accidental death gave rise to some of his finest poems, but his life was thrown into irrecoverable chaos. Gaining odds and ends of teaching, and supported by friends and admirers, he retrieved his Catholic faith before he died. Clark writes that â€˜although he abhorred Henry Lawson as a poet and a man, the progress of their lives was hauntingly similar: promise, achievement, degeneration, disgrace, posthumous legend.â€™"

Born in Adelaide, he studied painting and drawing at the South Australian School of Art and Design and started taking photographs while completing his degree. He then moved to Sydney and from the mid-1990s began increasingly to specialise in portraiture. With clients including film studios and record companies, his carefully composed and thought-provoking photographs have appeared in a range of Australian and international publications including _Vogue_, _Marie Claire_, _Elle_, _Who_, _Rolling Stone_, _Inside Sport_ and _GQ_. In 2005, the National Portrait Gallery presented the exhibition _Peter Brew-Bevan: Portraits_ and he was one of eight photographers included in the Portrait Galleryâ€™s 2014 exhibition _Promo: Portraits from Prime Time_. His photographic book _Shoot: Studio Sessions_ (2007), a selection of his images of actors and other celebrities, won six industry awards for concept and design. In 2019, Brew-Bevan founded the 2020 MEN-Tality Project in partnership with Beyond Blue, which focuses on destigmatising men's mental health through a series of portraits of prominent Australian men with experience of depression and anxiety. The Portrait Gallery's collection includes 21 of his photographs."

In the early 1920s she travelled to southeast Asia, where as 'Miss Bobby' she appeared to good notices as a cabaret and musical comedy performer. In 1926 she established a Performing Arts Academy in Shanghai. She married in England in 1929 and with her husband became co-director and designer for Pellier Ltd, a fashionable Mayfair dress salon. In 1949 she returned to Australia. After ten years of painting and exhibiting, she established a wallpaper business, Australian (Hand Printed) Wallpapers Pty Ltd in St Leonards, Sydney, which later became Florence Broadhurst Wallpapers Pty Ltd in Paddington. Finding the monochromatic, muted tonings that Australians favoured for interiors insufficiently vigorous to 'withstand modern living', she responded with vibrant oversized prints. The Broadhurst Design Collection had grown to some 800 patterns when Broadhurst was murdered in October 1977. The case has never been solved. More than 500 examples of her prints have been revived by Signature Prints, a Sydney business marketing Broadhurst wallpaper, textiles and art, and the designs have been archived by the Powerhouse Museum. Gillian Armstrong's feature film about Broadhurst, Unfolding Florence, and Helen O'Neil's lavishly-designed biography of the designer both appeared in 2006."

The family settled in Carlton. In 1934, he started classes in painting and sculpture with Napier Waller at the Working Men's College (now RMIT) and later won a scholarship to the Brunswick Technical College. The Depression put an end to his studies, and in 1940 he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Force. At the conclusion of his military service, in 1945, he married and established a fashion design business, but continued to paint and sculpt and occasionally exhibit his work. By 1967, he was in a position to open the Joseph Brown Gallery in Collins Street, Melbourne, at which he frequently showed mixed exhibitions of contemporary Australian art. Over time, Brown built up one of the finest private art collections in Australia, and made such substantial contributions to Australian art history that he was awarded three honorary doctorates. His gallery often exhibited the work of overlooked or forgotten artists, and his work had the effect of reinstating colonial art, portraiture and other 'unfashionable' genres to critical and scholarly attention. During the same period, Brown donated in excess of 400 works of art to public collections, including a gift of over 150 works with a total value of $35 million to the National Gallery of Victoria in 2004."

She was married for five years in the early 1930s, giving birth to a son; separated, she moved to South Yarra, where, encouraged by Jock Frater and Iain McKinnon, she developed an interest in art. By 1938 her work was included in the Herald Exhibition of Outstanding Pictures. Apart from a few lessons she took with George Bell in 1948, and a few months at the Grande ChaumiÃ¨re in Paris in 1953, she had no formal art training. She never became allied with the major Melbourne art cliques, the George Bell circle or the Heide crowd. Instead, for much of the 1940s, her home, Darebin Bridge House, became a meeting place for the Meanjin literary set and artists including Ian Fairweather, who often camped at her so-called â€˜Pink Hotelâ€™. In 1948 she moved to Harkaway, near Berwick. Between 1937 and 1974 she painted more than 70 portraits of her artistic and literary contemporaries; for much of this time, she was a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, but she left the group in 1966 (only to rejoin in 1991). The first of her many portraits, of fellow artist Ambrose Hallen, was donated to the National Portrait Gallery by Sir James and Lady Cruthers in 2001; her later portrait of Alan Marshall had been one of the first acquired for the collection, three years earlier. One of her best-known portraits, representing Jean Campbell but titled _The babe is wise_, is in the collection of the NGV along with fourteen of her other works. Since the early 1980s Bryans has attracted a good deal of critical interest and her works have been exhibited often. Gillian Forwoodâ€™s _Lina Bryans: Rare Modern 1909-2000_ was published in 2003."

Over the next decade she was director of the Queensland Womenâ€™s Information Service, director of Queenslandâ€™s Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner. Having spent three years as chair of the National Childcare Accreditation Council, in 1997 she became principal and chief executive officer of the Women's College within the University of Sydney.

There certainly were some knockbacks that I had. I mostly kept them to myself because, you know, we were brought up to be pretty stoic in a way, my generation. Little girls were to be seen and not heard, so you sort of took those knockbacks on the chin a bit. But amongst them were people whom I remember with respect and a deep affection, who were great supporters, who encouraged me and anything Iâ€™ve ever achieved in my life has been with wonderful support and encouragement.\\n\\nBut I have to say, Iâ€™m also very conscious of women who donâ€™t have the supports and the opportunities and the encouragement that they need. And very often they are women living on the edges of our society in many ways. My mantra for a long time has been â€˜You can have it all but not all at the same timeâ€™. I think thatâ€™s quite an important thing for women to remember when they are taking on all the responsibilities that they have and the hard road to fulfilling their ambitions, their hopes and their dreams.\\n\\nSo, I am very keen to do anything I can to support and encourage them quietly in the background. Thatâ€™s what I like to focus on now, is this passing on to younger women the sort of help and guidance and encouragement particularly that was given to me by older women.",

From this period on, his landscapes and flower pieces sold well, particularly in Victoria and South Australia, and from the time of his first Sydney exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries in 1927 he was commissioned as a portraitist. With a remarkable 72 portraits hung in the Archibald Prize between 1924 and 1966, he won the Prize in 1932 with a portrait of Sir William Irvine. At the end of the second world war he was sent as an official war artist to document the Japanese surrender; he missed the ceremony, but still completed 51 works for the War Memorial. Over the course of his career he made many articulate attacks on modern art."

                "transcript": "Being predominantly, I suppose, we could say over the years, a landscape painter, battling with the changes that occur from hour to hour outdoors, trying to match the subtle changing scene, I did actually, I think, try to evolve a working method which would enable me to match, or catch, in shape, tone and colour fleeting effects of nature which would not recur again. Itâ€™s whatâ€™s known as direct painting. I think one of my exhibition managers said: â€˜Youâ€™re a first-class direct painter, Buckmasterâ€™. And I hardly knew what he meant in those days, but I can see it clearly now. Thereâ€™s the subject, you put up your canvas, you assess the picture, nature provides you with the inspiration, you, in your mindâ€™s eye, you eliminate the unessentials, you assess and you conceive your picture from what is before you.\\n\\nAnd so, shape, tone and colour: see it, conceive it, think of it, realise it, see your picture in your mindâ€™s eye, then pick up your loaded palette and your brushes and cover the canvas with the masses, the main masses in tone and subtle colour first; the details follow automatically as the pieces fit into a jigsaw puzzle. That has been one angle of my working method on landscape.\\n\\nItâ€™s quite a totally different technique on portraiture or figure composition. Itâ€™s a different thing altogether. Itâ€™s too involved to go into now.",

Linda Jean Burney MP (b. 1957), a Wiradjuri woman, is the first First Nations person elected to the New South Wales parliament, and the first First Nations woman to serve in the federal House of Representatives. Born in Whitton in south-west New South Wales, she attained a Diploma of Education from Mitchell College of Advanced Education (now part of Charles Sturt University) in the 1970s, thereby becoming the institution's first Aboriginal graduate. She began her teaching career in western Sydney in 1979 and later worked as an education policy advisor before being appointed Director General of the NSW Department of Aboriginal Affairs. She was elected Member of the Legislative Assembly for Canterbury (NSW) in 2003, subsequently becoming Deputy Leader of the Opposition and holding shadow portfolios including Family and Community Services, Aboriginal Affairs, and Sport and Recreation. In 2016 she resigned from her state post to contest the federal seat of Barton. She was sung into parliament for her inaugural speech, in which she stated that 'recognition of first people in our nation's constitution is the next step â€¦ towards a country that can look itself in the eye knowing that we have come of age'. As a member of the shadow ministry between 2016 and 2022 she held the portfolios of Human Services, Families and Social Services, Indigenous Australians, and Preventing Family Violence. She made history again on being sworn in as Minister for Indigenous Australians in June 2022, becoming the first First Nations woman to serve in federal cabinet. Burney has been a member of the National Social Justice Task Force of ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and has represented Aboriginal Australians at the United Nations. She holds an honorary doctorate from Charles Sturt University and has served on a number of boards including those of SBS, the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board and the NSW Board of Studies."

As Harry Penrith, he spent his childhood at Bomaderry childrenâ€™s home and the notorious Kinchela Boysâ€™ home. A talented sportsman, he played first grade rugby union for Parramatta, as well as rugby league and cricket. He then joined the Australian public service, working for the Department of Agriculture for thirteen years. In the mid-1960s he became involved with Indigenous rights activism, lobbying for the 1967 Referendum. While studying law at the University of Tasmania he led a successful campaign to reclaim the remains of Truganini from the Tasmanian Museum in Hobart. He was part of the establishment of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra in 1972 and the following year worked as a manager of Aboriginal Hostels. He received a Churchill Fellowship to travel overseas to study accommodation techniques in overseas hostels for Indigenous cultures. In 1976 he changed his name to Burnum Burnum (great warrior) to honour his great-grandfather, artist Tommy McRae, and to attest to his Aboriginality. Burnum ran for the Australian Senate as an independent in 1983 and 1984. During the bicentenary celebrations in 1988 he laid claim to England at the white cliffs of Dover, erecting the Aboriginal flag. That year he wrote Burnum Burnum's _Aboriginal Australia: A Traveller's Guide_. A biography by JM Norst, _A Warrior for Peace: Burnum Burnum_, was published in 1999."

After some yearsâ€™ travel, exhibiting and working independently, she completed her degree through Adelaide Centre for the Arts in 2006. Since then, in a number of portraits of both notable Australian public figures and â€˜unknownâ€™ subjects, she has sought to explore the dichotomy of the public and private self. Her work has featured in solo and group exhibitions in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney, and has been selected for exhibition in the Doug Moran Portrait Prize, the Portia Geach Memorial Award, the Sulman Prize, the Waterhouse National Science Art Prize, the Archibald Prize, the Sunshine Coast Art Prize, the Albany Art Prize, the Arthur Guy Memorial Painting Prize and the Geelong Contemporary Art Prize. In 2014 she became the first artist chosen to undertake a Guildhouse Collections Project at the Art Gallery of South Australia, producing a quiet series of paintings of people engaging with artworks in the Gallery. She won the Kennedy Arts Foundation Award for her work _The Ineffable_ in 2016. But-Husaimâ€™s work is held in public and private collections throughout Australia."

Later, she studied psychology, music and economics part-time at Adelaide University. She married businessman Frank Buttfield in 1936. Her interest in politics was encouraged by her father, a state parliamentarian, and family friend Robert Menzies, from whom she sought advice about a political career. In 1954, she was endorsed as the Liberal Party candidate for Adelaide, unsuccessfully contesting the seat in the federal election that year. When a senate seat fell vacant in 1955, she was elected to parliament as a Liberal senator for South Australia, serving from 1955 to 1965 and again from 1968 to 1974. Though her support for women's rights put her at odds with some of her male colleagues, she lobbied on issues such as equal pay for women and for the right of married women to work in the Public Service. Despite her staunch anti-communist views, she was the first female senator to visit the USSR, and she toured China alone in 1962. In 1972, she was made a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. After she retired from politics in 1974 she and her husband developed the Youth Venture Club. She also served on many boards and made philanthropic contributions to youth and the arts."

Although in the 1950s the Indigenous people of the region were actively discouraged from pursuing any of their traditions, Campbell's father was a boomerang maker and Campbell observed him at his craft, shaping wood and inscribing designs. Educated at the Burnt Bridge Mission School, from the age of fourteen Campbell worked in a series of menial jobs in Kempsey and Sydney. When he returned to his birthplace, he started to paint in earnest, depicting, as he said, his personal response to his environment, 'both past and present, the people, the landscape, and my own relationship with both . . . Aboriginal culture naturally becomes a part of my work as a reflection of my heritage and ancestry, but my message is to all people.' In the 1980s, shows in Sydney and Melbourne at the Roslyn Oxley and Christine Abrahams galleries brought him critical recognition. In 1987 he was the artist in residence at the Tin Sheds at the University of Sydney and he was commissioned to create a poster for the Bicentennial Authority. In the late 1980s he travelled to Ramingining in the Northern Territory; he found the experience of the traditional community totally new, and to a certain extent the visit influenced his subsequent work. His portraits _My Brother Mac Silva_ 1989 and _Sammy Alfie Drew: Local Macleay Aboriginal Sporting Identity_ 1990 were hung in the Archibald; in 1990 he had a solo show at the Rebecca Hossack Gallery in London. Campbell's picture _The Provider of the Tucker_ 1987 was hung in the National Portrait Gallery exhibition _A Face in the Crowd_ in 1997; his _Aboriginal Embassy_ 1986 was shown in _Open Air: Portraits and Landscapes_ in 2008."

                "content": "Judy Cassab AO CBE (1920â€“2015) was one of Australia's best-loved, most successful and prolific portrait painters. Born in Vienna, she studied art in Prague and at the Budapest Academy before adopting false papers and 'going underground' to escape the persecution of Hungarian Jews. After the war, she and her husband reunited and emigrated to Australia in 1951. Within months of arriving in Sydney, she was commissioned by Sir Charles Lloyd Jones to paint a portrait of his wife, becoming an Archibald finalist for the first time the following year. In 1953, she held her first Australian solo exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The winner of the _Australian Women's Weekly_ Portrait Prize in 1955 and 1956, by the mid-1960s she was sought-after as a portraitist, completing commissions for high-profile clients such as Princess Alexandra and Queen Sirikit of Thailand. In 1960, she won the Archibald Prize for her portrait of her friend, Stanislaus Rapotec; in 1967, she won it again with her painting of artist Margo Lewers. In all, Cassab had 41 paintings exhibited in the Archibald Prize. \\n\\nThrough her many other portraits â€“ both formal commissions and portrayals of family and friends â€“ she created a distinct record of Australian society from the 1950s onwards. Cassab also found inspiration for a more abstract style of painting in the landscape of the Northern Territory, to which she repeatedly returned, and won several awards for her landscape works in the Wynne Prize. Her many awards include an honorary doctorate from the University of Sydney and the 1996 Nita B Kibble Literary Award for her published diaries."

Then, as I developed in my other paintings, the portrait developed with it. I still think that every portrait I do is a failure because it didnâ€™t reach what I wanted to do with it. I think Iâ€™m best known as a portrait painter because these are the things that get most publicity, but I never wanted to be a portrait painter and I donâ€™t consider myself one.\\n\\nLately, I tried to combine abstract with the portrait but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good marriage. I think the best I can do is to paint my abstract pictures and develop them and develop myself, and let the portraits flow freely, because I donâ€™t believe that something which was art all through the centuries stops being art just because it lost its credit by the photographic portraits, the anonymous portraits, from which we have 300 in each country in the world; and although I know that it is a clash, I think, between my other paintings and the portraits, I canâ€™t give up. Itâ€™s something that interests me, and that I might solve or might not. Anyway, it doesnâ€™t matter if I solve it when Iâ€™m 70.",

In 1980 the band changed its name to The Birthday Party and moved to London, where it significantly influenced other punk bands. With several talented recruits, members of the Birthday Party formed The Bad Seeds, whose first album was released in 1984. Cave has participated in a number of fruitful musical collaborations and side projects including the band Grinderman. He has also been involved in several films as an actor, screenwriter and composer, including the arthouse sensation _Wings of Desire_ (1987) and _Ghosts ... of the Civil Dead_ (1988). He scripted the grim Australian drama _The Proposition_ (2006); appeared in _I'm Your Man_ (2005â€“2006); and co-wrote and starred in a wry documentary drama about himself, _20,000 Days on Earth_ (2014). A long-term resident of the UK, Cave has written novels and poetry while performing and issuing albums regularly. His 2013 release with The Bad Seeds, _Push the Sky Away_, was the band's first Australian number-one album. Cave released his latest album _Carnage_ in 2021, as a duo with long-term member of The Bad Seeds, Warren Ellis."

Having worked with ABC radio in Darwin and Newcastle, she became a newsreader with the multicultural and multilingual public broadcast channel, SBS, in 1988, gaining devoted viewers through her stern, even contemptuous delivery and superbly-cut tops and jackets. As host of the network's _Fashionista_ program she built a reputation as a style authority, in 2008 curating the National Archives of Australia exhibition of historical fashion photographs, _Strike a Pose â€¦ With Lee Lin Chin_. Known also as a comedian and a voice for social change, she has a huge social media following although she posts little, if anything, herself, retaining an intriguing air of mystery. Her 'Chinspirational' book, _Iced Beer and Other Tantalising Tips for Life_, co-written with Chris Leben, was published in 2016. Among the causes Chin supports is The Social Studio, an enterprise dedicated to creating employment and educational pathways for young people who have been refugees."

A charity worker, arts patron, feminist and amateur artist, she was the eldest daughter of judge Arthur Wolfe Chomley and Juliana, and grew up in Melbourne and later at Dromkeen, the Chomley family's property at Riddells Creek. In her early twenties Mary spent time in Burma and India, and following her mother's death in 1897 took on the running of the family homes. She became involved with the Victorian Ladies' Work Association and, in 1906, was the secretary for the committee who instigated and organised the First Australian Exhibition of Women's Work, which attracted a quarter of a million visitors and is now considered a landmark event in the history of womenâ€™s art in Australia. Chomley was one of the founders of the Arts and Crafts Society of Victoria, and in 1909 became founding secretary of the state branch of the Victoria League for Commonwealth Friendship. She went to England in June 1914 and, prevented from getting home by the outbreak of war, threw herself into work: teaching English to Belgian refugees in London, giving crochet lessons and volunteering at the Robert Lindsay Memorial Hospital for Officers. She then went to France to work at a canteen that supplied food and clothing to British and allied troops. After returning to London, she was superintendent of the domestic staff at Princess Christian's Hospital for Officers, then, in 1916, she joined the newly formed Prisoners of War Department of the Australian Red Cross, coordinating a team of volunteers to distribute thousands of parcels to Australian and New Zealand troops taken prisoner on the Western Front. Her work for the Red Cross was honoured in 1918, when she was awarded an OBE. Remaining in London after the armistice, Chomley was the Australian representative on the Society for the Overseas Settlement of British Women and, from 1925 to 1933, chair of the Women's Section of the British Legion. Chomley returned permanently to Melbourne in 1934, resuming her work with the Victoria League and the Arts and Crafts Society. She died at her home in Toorak, aged 88."

Spending a year in Germany in 1933, she returned to Melbourne to study German at the University of Melbourne. Here she met Manning Clark, who was to become Australia's most influential historian. Marrying at Oxford, the Clarks lived in Canberra from 1949 onward; that year, Manning became inaugural Professor of History at the Canberra University College (later the ANU). In their Forrest home Dymphna raised her six children and entertained countless visitors at meals prepared with produce from her own garden. From the 1960s she taught in the German department at ANU; her son Axel later taught in the English department there, and contributed substantially to the body of critical analysis of Australian literature. Dymphna's translations include several of Manning Clark's books and, notably, The New Holland Journal of Count Carl Von Hugel (1994). The Clarks spent much time at their property at Wapengo, NSW, where Dymphna, an avid plantswoman, revegetated large areas with volunteers."

Between 1938 and 1941 she made two huge figures for the Royal Hobart Hospital, a memorial fountain in Bendigo, panels for the Mutual Life and Citizen's Building, Sydney, and the massive figure for the Pioneer Women's Memorial in Adelaide. She then turned to teaching, while continuing to produce sculptures for churches. Late in her career she made the fairies' tree for Melbourne's Fitzroy Gardens.

Three years later he was commissioned deputy judge advocate of New South Wales. He arrived in the Sirius at Botany Bay on 20 January 1788, and was one of the party that went to size up Port Jackson the next day. There, on 7 February he read the Act, commissions and letters patent inaugurating the government. He was responsible for all legal matters, and before long, for convict labour, health, rations and stores. In December 1791, with the departure of the detachment of marines and the arrival of the New South Wales Corps, his pay was reduced; after his patron, Arthur Phillip left, he was stranded in the colony assisting Francis Grose and then William Paterson. Returning to England in June 1797 he completed volume 1 of An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, which sold well and was translated into German by 1799. Although he tried to stay in England, he was sent to form a new settlement in Bass Strait in 1803. Finding conditions at Port Phillip Bay unpromising, he suggested removal of the settlement to Risdon on the Derwent, but finding that, too, unsuitable he chose Sullivan Cove as the site for Hobart Town. The early years of the settlement he superintended there were gruelling; although he had been made a colonel, his appeals to England for decent supplies were ignored and he was in fact rebuked, from Sydney, for extravagance. His life became worse after the arrival, in March 1809, of William Bligh, who criticised his administration â€“ as had a spiteful Joseph Foveaux in Sydney, years before. Popularly, however, he was well-regarded for his humane approach and cheerful manners. A temporary place of worship was erected over his grave in St. David's Burial Ground in 1810; and in 1817, the foundation stone of the new St. David's Cathedral was laid in his memory. The Collins Streets in Hobart and Melbourne are also named after him."

Cook's father was a labourer and he attended the village school before gaining a job in a shop. In 1747 he took up an apprenticeship with a coal-shipper in Whitby. Through application to his studies, particularly of mathematics, he prospered, and saw action around the Gulf of St Lawrence, where he developed his extraordinary expertise in surveying and mapping. In mid-1768 he was chosen by the Admiralty to observe the transit of Venus in Tahiti. Henceforth, he was almost continually at sea until his death in early 1779. Cook opened up vast areas that had previously been only tentatively investigated, and charted them with extraordinary accuracy. Accounts produced from his voyages provided Europeans with their first glimpse of the culture, wildlife and geography of lands as diverse as Tahiti and Alaska, and as a result of measures he took to raise standards of hygiene and nutrition on board his ships, there was an appreciable improvement in the health of future British seamen. Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii, on 14 February 1779, after having left and then returned to make essential repairs."

As soon as I saw this, I ordered the boats to lay upon their oars in order to speak to them. But this was to little purpose for neither us nor Tupia could understand one word they said. When then through them some nails, beads, etc. ashore which they took up and seemed not ill-pleased in so much that I thought they beckoned us to come ashore. But in this we were mistaken, for as soon as we put the boat in again, they again came to oppose us, upon which I fired a musket between the two, which had no other effect that to make them retire back where bundles of their darts lay. And one of them took up a stone and threw at us, which caused my firing a second musket load with small shot. And although some of the shot struck the man, yet it had no other effect than to make him lay hold of a shield or target to defend himself.  \\nImmediately after this, we landed, which we had no sooner done than they throwed two darts at us. This obliged me to fire a third shot, soon after which they both made off, but not in such haste but what we might have taken one. But Mr Banks being of opinion that the darts were poisoned made me cautious how I advanced into the woods. We found here a few small huts made of the bark of trees, in one of which were four or five small children, with whom we left some strings of beads etc. A quantity of darts lay about the huts, these we took away with us.",

                "content": "Carl Cooper (1912-1966), ceramic decorator, contracted poliomyelitis in his twenties. Although he lived in Murrumbeena, he met the Boyd family through John Perceval, who also had polio and whom he had met in hospital. In 1941, Arthur Boyd painted him in his wheelchair, pushed by David Boyd, in a work called _Progression_ which was bought by John Reed. Living close to the AMB pottery established by Arthur Merric Boyd and John Perceval in the mid-1940s, Cooper became interested in making pots himself. Boydâ€™s biographer Darleen Bungey provides a vivid account, based on Boydâ€™s recollections, of what he was like to be around: â€˜His ambitions had been thwarted. Initially he had wanted to be a pilot, or, if not a pilot, then a steward for BOAC, the British airline. Polio grounded him, hitting him harder than Perceval and sentencing him to life in a wheelchair. These two men together made Arthurâ€™s life a misery: â€œJohn and Carl . . . it was like living with a cat and a mouse . . . . constantly fighting, constantly brawling . . . and it came back to rest on usâ€. If Carl wasnâ€™t creating chaos at the pottery, he was disrupting Open Country: â€œHe used to wind himself around to our house . . . heâ€™d have terrible fights with people . . . throw things and lash out at anyone at the nearest point to him.â€ Arthurâ€™s description of Carl Cooper, â€œdissatisfied, fierce, crushedâ€, is confirmed in a series of portraits. In each painting he seems both mentally and physically uncomfortable. His head is held stiffly, his neck set at a rigid angle. The only movement in one work comes from the loose rendering of his jacket, suggesting the momentum of wildly spinning arms.â€™ Cooper lived with the orphan Barry Gordon, who pushed him up to the pottery each day. Gordon mixed the clay and Boyd and Perceval threw pots for Cooper to decorate until Cooperâ€™s â€˜explosive, jealous, possessiveâ€™ personality led to brawls, usually with Perceval. Cooperâ€™s pieces were characteristically functional earthenware, incised or painted in designs influenced by Aboriginal bark paintings he had seen reproduced in _Art in Australia_. Sometime after 1945, Cooper set up his own studio. He was often too ill to work and eventually ceased production in 1963. The National Gallery of Australia has nine of his pieces."

                "content": "Grace Cossington Smith OBE (1892â€“1984) was a pioneer of modernist art in Australia. Born in Sydney, Cossington Smith began her training in art in 1910 with the Italian-born teacher, Antonio Dattilo Rubbo, who she later described as 'the only one in Sydney at that time who knew anything about the modern masters'. Her parents, Ernest and Grace Smith, supported her pursuit of art, enabling her to spend two years studying in England, where she was inspired by post-impressionism. She returned to Rubbo's classes in Sydney in 1914 and the following year her painting _The Sock Knitter_, considered the first post-impressionist work painted in Australia, was included in the Royal Art Society exhibition. Around 1920, she adopted the surname Cossington Smith, 'Cossington' being the name of the family home in Turramurra where Grace lived and worked for almost 65 years. Despite the hostility of the conservative Sydney art establishment, Cossington Smith became one of a group of artists who stayed resolute in their exploration of modernism. In the late 1920s, she began exhibiting with the Contemporary Group (established in 1926 by George Lambert and Thea Proctor) and held the first of many solo exhibitions; in the same period she commenced work on her exhilarating and now celebrated series of paintings of the Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction. Following the deaths of her parents in the 1930s, Cossington Smith moved from her garden studio to one attached to the main house and during the 1940s began to focus on intimate paintings of interiors, in which she expressed forms with colour and light. Her contribution to Australian art went largely unrecognised until, at age 81, she was honoured with a retrospective exhibition, which opened at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1973 and toured to state galleries. She was awarded an OBE the same year. She eventually left Cossington and moved to a nursing home, where she died at the age of 92 in December 1984. Her works have since become among those most recognised in the collections of major galleries and in the canon of modern art in Australia."

She left for England in 1952, where she worked in radio drama with the BBC. Returning to Australia in 1954 she joined the Phillip Street Theatre, in 1965 heading the cast of _A Cup of Tea, a Bex and a Good Lie Down_. Over the ensuing years she appeared in many plays, including a memorable performance as Lady Bracknell in _The Importance of Being Earnest_ for the Melbourne and Sydney theatre companies, which was staged several times from 1988 to 1992. She was a member of the STC Board of Directors from 1980 until 1994, and a Patron from 1994 to 2002. Meanwhile, her film career began with a role in _Smiley Gets a Gun_ (1958), and was followed by roles in films including _The Singer and the Dancer_ (1977), _The Night the Prowler_ (1978), _The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith_ (1977), _The Dismissal_ (1983), _Spider and Rose_ (1994) and _Lilian's Story_ (1996). Her autobiography, _A Biased Memoir_ (1997), was followed by a thoughtful and affecting account of the death of her husband and her own 'journey' through grief, _Journey From Venice_ (2000). In 2001 she received the Gold Logie Hall of Fame Award and a lifetime achievement award at the Helpmann Awards. Cracknell was an influential spokesperson for older Australian women and an advocate for Aboriginal rights."

Having worked for two years on Thursday Island for the Diocese of Carpentaria, he began painting scenes of island life. Comparisons with Gauguin are inevitable, though Crooke often painted people in dim interiors against a window giving onto bright light. A long-time resident of Cairns, he travelled extensively in northern Australia and painted some remarkably evocative landscapes, such as _Chillagoe_ 1962, _Landscape with rocks in foreground_ 1967 and _Ant Hill Country, Laura_ 1969, all in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. In 1966 he served as an official war artist in Vietnam. He won the Archibald Prize in 1969 for a portrait of a close friend, the writer George Johnson. In the mid-1990s he donated his collection of works by Drysdale, Friend, Olley and Boyd to Perc Tucker Regional Gallery, Townsville, which mounted _North of Capricorn_, a major retrospective of his work that toured in 1998-1999. Crooke is represented in all major Australian galleries and his work remains popular amongst collectors."

That is why I think that I found the pattern in the islands, the simple island people living in some sort of crude harmony with nature, so exciting and fascinating. This relationship is deeper than just a decorative pattern of people walking in tropical foliage, itâ€™s something which I have always felt myself. Iâ€™ve always been interested in the study of nature, from the smallest facets of insects up to birds and animals and plants, not in a scientific way but in a practical way, in a sense of wonderment; the beauty and the sort of mystery about them is very important to me. In fact, this feeling of wonder, to be able to sort of see these things with some sort of fresh vision, is the thing that I find most important to keep.\\n\\nThe relationship of the man to his environment is quite a problem pictorially because although I want to paint man in relation to nature, I also want to paint good paintings, that is, paintings that have the values of paint and colour and shape and so on. So all the facets of a good painting â€“ design, texture, and all the values and so on â€“ I try and I hope that I can weld them into this one simple expression of man in some form of dignified harmony with the natural world around him.",

After suffering many insults as the daughter of a single mother, as a teenager she was noticed on a Tamworth street by a photographer, who encouraged her to move to Sydney and try her luck at modelling. She described herself as 'looking like a milkmaid' at the time she scored her first assignments for major department stores, but she was named Model of the Year in 1949. Catwalk shows for David Jones followed, along with contracts for magazines including the _Australian Women's Weekly_ and _Woman's Day_. At the age of 22, in 1950, she established the June Dally-Watkins School, which has since trained countless students in deportment and etiquette in Sydney and Brisbane. The following year she established Australia's first modelling agency and, later, a business college. Famously romanced by actor Gregory Peck during a visit to Rome in the 1950s, she returned to Australia to continue her career, marry and raise four children. In 1969 she published _The June Dally-Watkins Book of Manners for Moderns_. Dally-Watkins took her etiquette lessons to students in China in 2013, co-founding the Dally Institute in Guangzhou. Her autobiography _The Secrets Behind My Smile_ was published in 2002. Dally-Watkins died at the age of 92, leaving a lasting legacy not only on the Australian modelling industry, but on the thousands of students to whom she imparted impeccable manners and a knowledge of etiquette."

                "content": "William Dampier (1651-1715), seafarer and writer, had spent a good deal of time at sea as a buccaneer and merchant sailor before he spent three months in 1688 around King Sound (northern Western Australia) on the Cygnet. After further trading voyages in southeast Asia he returned to England, where he wrote accounts of his travels that became very popular. Regarding him as an authority on the region, the Admiralty made him captain of the Roebuck, dispatched to explore the South Seas in January 1699. In August, he reached the coast of what is now Western Australia and named Shark Bay, but he could not find fresh water and after four weeks he departed for Timor. His impression of the west coast landscape was unfavourable and he described the Indigenous inhabitants as â€˜the miserablest People in the Worldâ€™. Although he named New Britain (separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier Strait) in the early months of 1700, his ship was not fit for much further exploration and he returned to England, where in 1702 he was declared unfit to lead any more expeditions on behalf of the king. Nonetheless, he led a farcical privateering expedition south in 1703 and was a pilot on a worldwide voyage between 1708 and 1711. Dampier was of greater historical importance as an author than an explorer; his influential New Voyage Round the World, published in 1697, ran to many editions, and several further successful volumes followed. His works remain of interest to historians, navigators and meteorologists, as well as students of the literature of Swift and Defoe. Diana and Michael Prestonâ€™s biography A Pirate of Exquisite Mind was published in 2005; the authors point out that through his writings, Dampier introduced many words including â€˜chopsticksâ€™ and â€˜barbecueâ€™ into English. In 2015 the Western Australian Museum held a series of events to commemorate the tricentennial of Dampierâ€™s visit to the west coast."

After retiring as a player, Daniher was assistant coach for the Essendon and Fremantle football clubs. In 1998 he was appointed as senior coach to the Melbourne Football Club, where he steered the team for 10 seasons. During this time Daniher led the Demons to the 2000 AFL Grand Final against Essendon. Leaving coaching in 2007, he was appointed general manager of football operations at the West Coast Eagles in 2008 until his retirement in 2013.\\n\\nDaniher was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) in 2013, and made his diagnosis public the following year, when he co-founded the organisation FightMND with Pat Cunningham. FightMND's purpose is to research effective treatments, and eventually a cure, for Motor Neurone Disease. In 2015, Daniher became the public face of the foundation's biggest fundraising event, The Big Freeze, held during the annual Queen's Birthday football match between Melbourne and Collingwood at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. FightMND has raised and subsequently invested over $50 million into research and care initiatives since its foundation in 2014.\\n\\nDaniher was awarded the Member of the Order of Australia in 2016 for his efforts in raising awareness of MND and raising funds to help find a cure for the disease. In 2018 he was named the fourth-ever recipient of the AFL's John Kennedy Lifetime Achievement Award, recognising 'extraordinary and positive contribution to the game of Australian Football across multiple parts of the game'. In 2019 Daniher was named Victorian of the Year and released his memoir, _When All is Said & Done_, which won the 2020 Australian Book Industry Awards Biography of the Year. In recognition of his contribution to AFL coaching, in 2019, the AFL Coaches Association renamed their premier award the Neale Daniher AFL Coaches Association Lifetime Achievement Award. In the Queen's Birthday Honours List in 2021, Daniher was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia, for his ongoing charity work."

While he painted many landscapes and still-life pictures, he is renowned for his contribution to Australian portraiture and influence on subsequent generations of artists. An official war artist during the Second World War, he contributed more than 600 works to the Australian War Memorial. A professional portraitist for over 65 years, he undertook scores of private and corporate commissions, with subjects including the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and a who's who of leading Australian figures in many diverse fields such as the military, industry, sport, education and science. At the same time, his flair for administration resulted in his appointment as head of the National Gallery School from 1946 to 1953 and member of a variety of significant gallery boards and councils. Dargie won an unparalleled eight Archibald Prizes. The National Portrait Gallery holds 22 portraits by Dargie."

Letâ€™s say that I am painting a portrait. Well, I donâ€™t look at my subject as a person as we think of a person in normal circumstances; I think of my subject in terms of the medium in which I can express myself, that is, paints on a canvas, and I have to think of the limitations of this means of expression.\\n\\nI have only a certain number of coloured pigments which I can apply to a flat surface. And on a very sort of superficial analysis it can be seen at once that all that a painter has at his disposal to express his thoughts are colours which are light or dark in varying degrees, colours which are warm or cool, and certain shapes disposed in certain proportions. As we often say, we can only express ourselves by means of tone, proportion and colour, tone being the intensity of the pigment, proportion being the disposition of various shapes and colour, of course, is simply this matter of warmth or coolness. There is actually nothing else that we have to use. Weâ€™ve got no soul, no expression, no â€“ we havenâ€™t even got a three dimension. We have to give the illusion of a three dimension by the way in which we relate our three elements: tone, proportion and colour.\\n\\nWhen it comes to expressing a mood, well, we havenâ€™t any mood paint on our canvas, we have to arrange again our colours, our elements, in such a way that we can convey to the spectator some feeling which we have had.",

Under her leadership the Gallery grew from a small institution located in Old Parliament House to a significant Federal institution in its own building. Having studied science at the University of Queensland, Darling worked in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Melbourne in the late 1960s, and undertook postgraduate study in the Medical School of Monash University from 1973 to 1978. Soon her interests expanded to a variety of social and cultural concerns, including the Victorian Children's Aid Society and the Victorian State Opera Foundation. By the mid-1980s she was a major patron of art, music and health in the Australian community. After she married Gordon Darling in 1989, the couple convened the exhibition _Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery_, which toured nationally from 1992â€“1993. It demonstrated the potential for the institution and proved to be the impetus for its foundation. Since the Gallery was established in 1998 she has funded the acquisition of many diverse works for its collection. Marilyn Darling is the Deputy Chair of the Gordon Darling Foundation and a member of the National Gallery of Australiaâ€™s Gordon Darling Australia Pacific Print Fund."

That year, too, he and Marilyn Darling initiated the Darling Foundation-sponsored touring exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery, the interest generated by which led to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery, housed first in the National Library of Australia, then in Old Parliament House and then in its own building on King Edward Terrace, Parkes."

By 1749 he had published the first of his designs for carved furniture. In 1751 he published A New Book of Chinese, Gothic and Modern Chairs, and in 1753 he shared a premises for several months with designer Thomas Chippendale while working on the plates for Chippendaleâ€™s The Gentlemanâ€™s and Cabinet-Makerâ€™s Director (1754). Around the same time Darly was also producing and selling wallpapers (decorated with â€˜Modern, Gothic or Chinese Designsâ€™), and decorative motifs for porcelain, delftware and printed cotton. In 1757, having moved to a new location on The Strand, Darly began publishing caricatures which are described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as representing â€˜the first occasion on which caricature â€“ exaggeration of facial features â€“ was fused with political satire.â€™ Darlyâ€™s second wife, Mary (active 1760â€“1781) â€“ also a printseller and a self-styled â€˜Fun Merchantâ€™ â€“ increasingly took on responsibility for this side of the business, and in 1762 published Principals of Caricatura, credited as the earliest book on the subject. Matthias meanwhile continued publishing furniture and architectural designs. His A New Book of Ceilings was published in 1760 and he contributed to books such as Household Furniture in Genteel Taste (also 1760) and A Universal System of Household Furniture (1762). The Darlyâ€™s shop on the Strand â€“ the subject of a 1772 etching, published by Matthias, called â€˜The Macaroni Print Shopâ€™ â€“ also sold â€˜materials of every kind used in the Polite Arts of Drawing, Etching, & c. with all Sorts of drawing books for young Ladies and Gentlemenâ€™, as well as â€˜Ladies Stencils for painting Silks, Linens, Paper &c.â€™, portraits and historical prints. By the early 1770s, having occasionally fallen foul of the Establishment with their caricatures, the Darlys had begun focussing on fashion, publishing images such as â€˜The Ridiculous Taste, or the Ladies Absurdityâ€™ (c. 1771) and â€˜The Extravaganza, or the Mountain Headdress of 1776â€™, which lampooned the taste for preposterous hairstyles and wigs. The Darlys continued to publish caricatures regularly until Matthiasâ€™s death in January 1780. Prints by both Darlys are held in several prestigious print collections including those of the British Museum and the Bodleian Library, Oxford."

Born in Sydney, she spent the first six years of her life in the rural New South Wales town of Forbes. Dawson's mother, who had studied art with Will Ashton, recognised her daughter's talent early and was advised by Ashton to encourage it. She had her first formal lessons following her family's relocation to Melbourne in the early 1940s, attending the private art school run by artist and illustrator Harold Septimus Power. In 1951, aged sixteen, she enrolled at the National Gallery School and attended night classes with Sir William Dargie. Five years later, Dawson won a National Gallery of Victoria Travelling Scholarship and went to London, where she enrolled at the Slade School and the Central School to study painting, etching and lithography. She travelled in Italy and worked as a proof printer in Paris before returning to Melbourne in 1961. She held her first solo exhibition the same year and in 1963 set up an art school and workshop, where she printed the work of artists such as Albert Tucker, Charles Blackman and Russell Drysdale. Dawson was one of only three women included in the renowned exhibition of Australian abstraction, _The Field_, at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1968. After several years in Sydney, Dawson moved to live in the bush near Binalong, NSW, in 1973. That year, she won the Archibald Prize with a portrait of her husband, the late writer, actor and playwright Michael Boddy. In 1978, she and Boddy founded The Bugle Press, producing fine art books and prints. Her work is represented in all major public collections in Australia, and has been the subject of exhibitions at the National Gallery of Victoria (1979), the National Gallery of Australia (1996) and a 2006 touring exhibition, _Janet Dawson Survey_."

Now I find that although I must work directly, I usually work on about three or four paintings and a series of drawings before anything final comes out of this. A final, or a finalised painting, quite often happens fairly quickly. With my particular method it must be very fresh. I find that very clean, very fresh colour is essential. I find tremendous sensual delight in clarity and finality of area, so consequently a painting canâ€™t possibly have any labour on its actual surface, the labour must go on in other places. And I find that the more I work, the more prolonged are these periods of making studies and drawings.\\n\\nI find that Iâ€™m continually going back to the figure as being something that contains so much, so many possibilities. Through exploration, probably like all good sensualists, I keep finding the figure in landscape and the landscape in the figure; areas of flesh stretched across muscle or relaxed, tightened up, loose flesh, delicate little veins, bony areas, are things that I feel with tremendous ecstasy that Iâ€™ve never yet been able to put down in any way, something that Iâ€™m trying very hard to do at the moment.",

On his return to Sydney after a decade he managed to impress conservative and modernist art factions alike. In the Second World War, Dobell served in a camouflage unit and the Civil Construction Corps of the Allied Works Council. Out of this experience, in 1943, came two portraits: one of Joe Westcott, a loudmouthed, indolent wharfie, titled _The Billy Boy_; and another of fellow artist and camoufleur, Joshua Smith. Both paintings were hung in the Archibald Prize exhibition that year, and the portrait of Smith was announced the winner. The decision was challenged, however, by a faction of conservative artists who claimed that Dobell's painting of his friend was a caricature, not a portrait, and who took the matter to court. Meanwhile, the National Art Gallery (as the AGNSW was then known) extended the exhibition dates and by March 1944 the painting had reportedly been viewed by over 140,000 people. The court eventually found in Dobell's favour â€“ his lawyers having persuasively argued that likeness and photographic accuracy weren't necessarily one and the same thing. Dobell was affected physically and emotionally by the controversy and gave up painting for some time.\\n\\nSlowly, the artist rebuilt his career; he won both the Wynne Prize for landscape and the Archibald Prize for the second time, with a portrait of Margaret Olley, in 1948. He won another Archibald in 1959, and _Time_ magazine commissioned his portrait of Robert Menzies for its cover in 1960. These and other successes of Dobell's, including his knighthood, conferred in 1966, did much to increase the status of artists in Australia."

                "transcript": "Iâ€™ve often been asked why I became an artist. It was just a natural thing, I always wanted to draw, just as almost every kiddy does. But with me it just stuck, and all through school I liked drawing much better than any of the other lessons., as a matter of fact I was very poor at the other lessons. In the town of Newcastle where I lived there were no opportunities to study art, so I took the next best thing. I became apprenticed to an architect. Although that was mechanical drawing, in a way it satisfied me for the time being.\\n\\nThen I was able to come to Sydney later on, and I gave away architecture and started to study art at an art school.\\n\\nAs you go through studying, you get more and more keen, and then â€“ well, you just get into it. I went away to England on scholarships and studied abroad and saw the best works all around the world. It really becomes a mania, eventually, in art.\\n\\nI have often been asked what it is that makes me want to paint certain people. Well, I think, first of all, itâ€™s the interesting form, the sculptural form of the person and the strong characters of a person, the strong individuality. And I strive for that. I donâ€™t know whether other artists do it or not, but personally I like to fit them to my style. I see them as my style of painting and try to bring that style first. Itâ€™s a sculptural technique, more like sculpture than painting. And if I see those things in a person, well, I strive for it like a piece of sculpture. I particularly like the Gothic type of sculpture, and I try to get that into my better works.",

                "content": "Ken Done (b. 1940), painter, studied at East Sydney Tech before becoming an advertising graphic designer. He gave up work to paint full time in 1980. Soon, his stylised, colourful representations of Sydney's beaches, harbour, animals and flowers found their way onto placemats, t-shirts, bibs, swimwear, sheets, mugs and vases. In 1987, when Ellis took this photograph for Playboy, Done had an annual turnover of more than $4 million. Ellis spent time with him at his studio on the water at Chinaman's Beach in Middle Harbour, finding him to have 'a strong sense of himself as successful designer, entrepreneur and celebrity [but with] a humble side to him that keeps things well in perspective and will not allow him to be seduced by success.' Done recently told George Negus that sneers at his 'commercial' art by critics and other artists worried him - 'I'd be tougher than I really am if I told you that it didn't hurt sometimes' - but his business has endured, and his paintings still sell well, particularly in the UK and Japan. Done was named Australia's Father of the Year in 1989 and Mosman Citizen of the Year in 1993 and he was Australia's Goodwill Ambassador to UNICEF in 1993. A large exhibition of his art from the 1980s toured New South Wales between 1991 and 1993. The Powerhouse Museum, the restaurant of which was decorated by Done in the early 1990s, held a large solo exhibition of his work in 1994-1995."

Her fellow students at the George Bell School included Peter Purves Smith and Russell Drysdale, who had been at Geelong Grammar together. In 1937, Purves Smith left for Europe, followed in 1938 by Maisie and her mother. After Maisie returned home Purves Smith cabled his proposal to her but they were separated for the duration of the war. They married in 1946 in Melbourne, with Drysdale as best man; however, Purves Smith died following surgery to relieve symptoms of tuberculosis in 1949. Three years later, Maisie completed studies at the Public Library of Victoria, Library Training School and in 1953 was appointed Deputy Librarian at the City of Coburg Library. Later she was appointed Children's Librarian and given the responsibility of setting up the Children's Library, selecting and cataloguing the books. Having spent a few years managing the Austral Bookshop in Collins Street, from 1958 to 1963 she was Children's Librarian at the Camberwell City Library, and served on the Editorial Committee of the Children's Book Council of Victoria. During this time she also published reviews of children's books. In November 1963, Drysdale's wife died, and seven months later he and Maisie married. They bought a block of land on the Central Coast near Gosford, named it Bouddi Farm, and commissioned Melbourne architect Guilford Bell to design a house for them there. They lived there for the rest of their lives, though they travelled widely; Maisie outlived him by twenty years, and continued to travel."

We find that many artists have expressed themselves in various ways on what should be the expression of the Australian beginnings, which is the Aboriginals. But I search for the elemental thing, the depths of their past, the feeling of them living in this country and so forth. But further than that, I do find in the Australian bush there is the spirit of the elemental. One can feel it. Youâ€™re aware of it when you go silently into it.\\n\\nWhen I am approaching painting of a landscape, I firstly am aware of my subject. I want to know more of it. I walk into it. I must walk around and round all those trees and into the distance and the space that fills them, to listen, to find that feeling thatâ€™s vibrating, so as I can set it down in the spirit of that thing which I think is the essence that I should express.",

Born in Sydney, he received his first camera as a teenager and trained with photographer Cecil Bostock while working as his assistant. After setting up his own studio in 1934, Dupain established his reputation with portraiture and advertising work, gained exposure in the lifestyle magazine _The Home_, and photographed ballet dancers for the ABC, including dancers from the Kirsova Ballet and the three Ballets Russes companies that toured Australia between 1936 and 1940. While Dupain was on service during the Second World War, he briefly worked for the Department of Information from 1945 to 1947, photographing Australia for propaganda purposes. His then-wife Olive Cotton, one of very few professional women photographers in Australia, ran his studio. In the 1950s Dupain turned increasingly to architectural photography, collaborating in particular with architects Samuel Lipson, Sydney Ancher and Harry Seidler. From 1958 to 1973 he documented the construction of the Sydney Opera House. During the same period, he began photographing historic properties for the National Trust and recorded Canberra's new buildings for the National Capital Development Commission. In 1975 the Australian Centre for Photography mounted the touring exhibition _Max Dupain: A Retrospective 1930â€“1975_. This show brought Dupain's name to the attention of the wider public, and turned _The Sunbaker_, taken nearly 40 years earlier, into a definitive Australian image. Dupain continued to operate his studio on Sydney's Lower North Shore until he died at the age of 81."

And I looked through the catalogue of the retrospective exhibition just to check, and I find that all these pictures that I have in this show, 81 out of about 4,000, represent my responses to the environment in which I find myself, and thatâ€™s all there is to it. Thereâ€™s nothing world-shattering in any of these shots, they are just a simple and largely emotional response to an environment. Just little things: there might be grass growing in the sand, it might be a person, it might be a landscape at dusk, it might be an industrial operation at night. But this is my world. And I have no favourites. I just hope and worked towards the end that photography to me is my way of expressing my personal response to my environment. And thatâ€™s all there is to it.\\n\\nJust by way of a diversion, thereâ€™s a picture in the exhibition called _The Meat Queue_, which is a very good example of how lucky can you be. It consists of four or five old mums in a meat queue just after the war, in Sydney. I was doing a story on queues for the Department of Information at the time. I was in this butcherâ€™s shop and I just suddenly saw this action, and it was all over in a fraction of a second. Thereâ€™s movement in it, thereâ€™s a lot of intense feeling on the faces of these people, these women, and it has been one of the most, one of the favourite pictures in this show. But just sheer luck. There were half a dozen other photographs taken of this queuing operation in this butcherâ€™s shop at the time and not one of them are anything like this one.",

It has to be manipulated.\\n\\nOut of this great conglomeration of photo machinery, I have selected a few cameras which I try to keep to a minimum. My favourite camera is the Linhof, itâ€™s a 5 x 4 format, and I come back to this thing time and time and time again. We use a Hasselblad also for quick work, particularly for portrait work, and also a 35 mm camera. You can do an awful lot of work with those three cameras, and I try and keep it in that simple form.\\n\\nThe same applies to film and print paper. For black and white work, we use one line of Kodak film, and our print paper all comes from Ilford which we consider the best available here.\\n\\nNow, for colour work, which is supposed to be the up-and-coming thing but I doubt it very much â€“ Iâ€™m essentially a black and white man but we do a lot of colour work because we have to â€“ but until colour becomes a very much more controllable operation, I think black and white will still be, or will remain the intrinsic, inherent photographic medium. If you go to an exhibition of colour photography by a dozen photographers, itâ€™s very, very hard to find out whoâ€™s done what, they all look exactly alike, because the operation is essentially a mechanical one and the personal ingredient is minimised.",

He started exhibiting in the 1970s while working as a teacher and then a lecturer, initially at the Launceston School of Art and then at Burnie Technical College. In 1995, he won an Art Gallery of NSW residency at the CitÃ© Internationale des Arts, Paris. Primarily a landscape artist, much of Dyerâ€™s work was inspired by Tasmania, his subjects including such iconic places as the Franklin River, the South West World Heritage Area, Cradle Mountain and Lake St. Clare. He was a finalist in the Wynne Prize nine times (1977, 1988â€“1993, 1997, 2004); and the Sulman Prize twice (1997, 2006). Dyer painted one portrait per year (generally of a fellow Tasmanian) for entry in the Archibald Prize. He became an Archibald finalist for the first time in 1993 with his portrait of environmentalist and former federal leader of The Greens, Bob Brown; and ten years later took out the Prize with his portrait of novelist Richard Flanagan. He was again a finalist in the 2011 prize for his portrait of MONA founder, David Walsh. Dyer was commissioned by the Tasmanian Government to paint the official portrait of former state Premier Paul Lennon for the Parliament House collection. Dyer exhibited regularly in solo and group exhibitions since 1970 and his work is represented in many collections, including those of Artbank; the University of Tasmania; the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Hobart; the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Launceston aand the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Hobart."

From 1941 to 1949 he was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs, and during this period he also served as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In 1951, he became Leader of the Opposition. In 1949, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was established, and soon thousands of supposed communists were threatened with jail in the event of a war. When Prime Minister Menzies attempted to outlaw the Communist Party in Australia, Evatt led the effort to defeat the proposal. A referendum saw the Partyâ€™s legitimacy confirmed. Evatt led the Labor Party until 1960."

Although listed in July of the following year as one of the colony's 'duly qualified medical practitioners', Felton had also by this time established himself as a portrait painter. In January 1840, Felton exhibited examples of his paintings at a shop on George Street. This led to an acquaintance with the merchant and arts patron Alexander Brodie Spark. In September 1840, 'Mr Felton, Surgeon, top of Hunter Street' impressed the Sydney Herald with his 'fine, life size portrait of Her Majesty Queen Victoria' - a copy of the portrait by Thomas Sully, which Felton had seen in England. In December 1840, The Colonist recommended that 'lovers of the fine arts pay a visit to Dr. F's rooms in Hunter Street, and they will have the pleasure of ... recognising the likenesses which are in various stages of execution in [his] exhibition.' His talents as an artist being 'highly appreciated', Felton created portraits of a number of Sydney identities between this time and his unexpected and unexplained death, aged 40, in March 1842. Among the sitters depicted by Felton are Spark's wife, Frances Maria; pastoralist John Marquett Blaxland, his mother Harriott and sister, Anna Elizabeth Walker; Sophia O'Brien, the wife of newspaper proprietor; and Felton's friend and fellow artist, Conrad Martens. Felton's works are held in a select number of collections including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, National Gallery of Australia and the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales."

Born in England, Flinders entered the navy at age 15, served with Captain Bligh, and at age 20 sailed for Australia with surgeon George Bass. From 1798 to 1803 he made detailed surveys of Australiaâ€™s coastline and islands, enduring unsuitable, leaking and rotting vessels. The first person to circumnavigate Australia, he inspired and repaid loyalty amongst his comrades, and was sympathetic to the cultures of Indigenous Australians. In December 1803, during a trip back to England, Flinders was forced to take port in Mauritius due to the unfitness for service of his schooner. Here he was detained, unshackled, until 1810, because governor General De Caen, a supporter of Napoleon, suspected him of being an English spy. Having returned to England at last, Flinders saw the publication of his findings under the title _A Voyage to Terra Australis_ on 18 July 1814. The following day, he died. His grave, the whereabouts of which was long a mystery, was discovered beneath Euston Station, London, in January 2019 during archaeological surveys pending construction of a high-speed railway."

I cannot connect the idea of happiness with anything but thee. Without thee, the world would be a blank. I might indeed receive some gratification from distinction and applause of society; but where could be the faithful friend who would enjoy and share this with me â€“ into whose bosom my full heart could unburthen [sic] itself of excess of joy. Where would be that sweet intercourse of soul, that fine seasoning of happiness, without which a degree of insipidity attends all our enjoyments? From thee, my beloved, and thee only it is that I look to receive this zest for life, this height of luxury.\\n\\nI love thee most tenderly.

After a spell in Russia, he moved to England in 1766, teaching languages and natural history for a short time before producing A Catalogue of British Insects (1770). This and other publications brought him to the notice of Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1772. That year, aged forty-two, he was appointed naturalist on Cook's second voyage of discovery, on the Resolution; his son, Georg(e), accompanied him."

A linguistic prodigy, he travelled on the Resolution as his father's assistant. His elegantly-written scientific account of the voyage was a bestseller, and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In Europe from 1778, he taught at various universities and continued to travel and publish; the German translation of his account of the Resolution voyage, Reise um die Welt, was published in 1778 and significantly influenced contemporary German scientific and intellectual currents. In the early 1790s he became entangled in French revolutionary affairs, alienating his wife and friends; branded a traitor, he died alone in Paris, predeceasing his father without having realised his dream of producing an encyclopaedic account of the South Seas."

Born in New Zealand, Fredriksonâ€™s training as an artist began with classes at the Wellington Polytechnic College, which he undertook while working as a journalist and reviewer. In the early 1960s, having completed a theatre design apprenticeship, he moved to Australia and assisted with the design for the Australian Balletâ€™s _Auroraâ€™s Wedding_ (1964). Resident designer for the Melbourne Theatre Company from 1966 to 1974, he designed a great number of productions for the Australian Ballet, the Australian Opera, the Western Australian Opera, the South Australian Opera and the Sydney Theatre and Sydney Dance Companies. From 1975 onwards, Fredrikson collaborated regularly with Graeme Murphy, working with him on many productions including _Body of Work_ for the Sydney Dance Company and _Tivoli_, a co-production with the Australian Ballet. His numerous awards include three Helpmann Awards and an Australian Dance Award for services to dance (1999). The Arts Centre Melbourne presented a retrospective exhibition of his work in 1995, and in 2008 the _Kristian Fredrikson Scholarship for Design in the Performing Arts_ was established in his memory."

Settling in Melbourne, he became involved with photography and filmmaking, working with the ABC and training as a teacher. In the early days of the alternative theatre group the Pram Factory, he recorded productions and took portraits of actors and other performers including dancers at work at Margaret Lasicaâ€™s Modern Dance Ensemble. Applause Please and the widely-distributed Soft Soap, two of his early short films, featured Max Gillies; Camberwell Junction (1975) became something of a cult classic on the Melbourne and Sydney independent film scenes. While Gaal was a key figure in the Melbourne Filmmakersâ€™ Cooperative, having graduated from the Swinburne Film School in 1978 he worked at the Victorian Department of Education, directing many short films and documentaries including Tandberg on page 1 and Ibrahim (1983-1984), the latter exploring the experience of a teenaged refugee from Lebanon. Gaal was a finalist in the National Photographic Portrait Prizes of 2013 and 2015. Thirteen of his short films are held by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne. His work is favourably re-evaluated by prolific and esteemed film theorist Adrian Martin in â€˜Comment, think, analyse, experience and learn: The neglected film work of Ivan Gaalâ€™, Metro 2013.\\n\\nIvan Gaal believes his photograph of his friend George Spartels helped the actor win roles early in his career."

Garner was a secondary school teacher before the publication of her first novel, the semi-autobiographical _Monkey Grip_ (1977). Widely praised and winner of a National Book Council Award, it was made into a feature film released in 1982. A double novella, _Honour and Other People's Children_ (1980), a volume of short stories, _Postcards from Surfers_ (1985) â€“ which won the NSW Premier's Literary Award â€“ and the novels _The Children's Bach_ (1984), _Cosmo Cosmolino_ (1992), and the collection _The Feel of Steel_ (2001) followed. Garner's fiction has strong moral themes, and since the 1990s she has pursued a variety of profound ethical questions in journal articles and non-fiction books. In 1993 she won a Walkley Award for her _Time_ magazine article about Daniel Valerio, a two-year-old who died of systematic abuse inflicted by his mother's boyfriend. Two years later her book _The First Stone_, exploring claims of sexual harassment at Melbourne University's Ormond College, caused a national sensation. _True Stories_ (1997), a collection of non-fiction pieces, won the Nita B Kibble Award for women's life writing. Her rumination on the murder of a Canberra student, _Joe Cinque's Consolation_, was published in 2004 and made into a film in 2016. Since 2005 Garner has written occasional pieces for _The Monthly_, sometimes delightedly describing her life with her grandchildren. Her other books include _The Spare Room_ (2008), _This House of Grief: The Story of a Murder Trial_ (2014) and the collection _Everywhere I Look_ (2016)."

Iâ€™ve lost people who were acquaintances, or people who â€¦ And people who â€¦ real friends whoâ€™ve seen themselves in my books have taken it on the chin, you know, in a very remarkable way.\\n\\nI mean there is a characterâ€¦ there is a person on whom the character of Javo is based. You could imagine that perhaps such a personâ€™s life might have been altered in some way by the publication â€“ well not the publication of the book but by the bookâ€™s success and by the amount of publicity that itâ€™s had. He seems to me to be such a trouper about it. We very rarely see each other, but â€¦ heâ€™s in America but he came to see me a few weeks ago, the day before he left for America, I hadnâ€™t seen him for a long time, I hadnâ€™t seen him since before the film was made, and he hadnâ€™t seen the film. But he came for a visit and we just sat around, talked, had a cup of coffee, talked of what work he was doing, and this and that. And then one of us mentioned the name Monkey Grip and we both just burst out laughing. It was very encouraging and heartening because I realised that he didnâ€™t hold anything against me, and, rather the opposite, I think he rather liked the book. And he co-operated with the director of the film, he gave a lot of help to Ken Cameron in the making of the film, which I really loved him for and admired him for.\\n\\nAnd I think that this question of the autobiographical element or the biographical element in fiction, where people see themselves represented, or misrepresented in their view, by a fiction writer, itâ€™s a very difficult matter, particularly in womenâ€™s writing I think. Because women do tend, at least at this point in history, to write from very close to themselves. So itâ€™s always going to be a problem and I think itâ€™ll continue to be a problem for me.

Emerging as one of England's leading ceramicists in the 1950s, she returned with her husband to Australia in 1960; together they set about building a modern house in Paddington, while starting the first urban action group in Sydney to help save the area. Unlike other ceramicists at the time, Gazzard used hand-building techniques to create sculptural forms inspired by Cycladic sculpture and pre-Colombian pottery. In 1973, with fibre artist Mona Hessing, Gazzard was one of the first craftspeople invited to exhibit at the National Gallery of Victoria. The exhibition, _Clay + Fibre_, generated much discussion about whether craft was art and accelerated acceptance of women artists. Through the 1970s and 1980s she exhibited large abstract works in a number of important group shows as well as solo exhibitions. Gazzard was also instrumental in the development of craft in Australia, including helping to set up the Crafts Council of Australia in 1971 and chairing the Crafts Board of the Australia Council in 1973. President of the World Crafts Council from 1980 to 1984, Gazzard was commissioned to create the bronze sculpture _Mingarri: The Little Olgas_ (1988), which stands in the central Executive Courtyard of Parliament House, Canberra. A major retrospective of her work was held at the SH Ervin Gallery in 1994, accompanied by a book by Christine France, _Marea Gazzard: Form and Clay_. Gazzard's _Bindu_ (2004) was commissioned for the Athens Olympic Games. The Art Gallery of New South Wales acquired her last major work, _Selini I_ (2009), in 2012."

Sometimes Iâ€™m asked where I get my ideas from and itâ€™s hard to say, sometimes it might be sitting in a movie, just a certain shape flicks across the screen and I think â€˜Thatâ€™s just what Iâ€™m looking forâ€™, or on a beach a piece of driftwood, or in the park a squashed fig. Anything can supply it when youâ€™re looking, when youâ€™re feeling the need for a new idea.\\n\\nIâ€™d say that the curve is the thing that interests me, seldom the straight line in an object. Iâ€™m very sensitive to curves, a wrong curve can ruin it from the first half-inch. If I know itâ€™s somehow not going to be right, I just break it up. I break up a lot of things; in fact in my studio at the moment I can see six or eight things that I will no doubt smash up. Perhaps itâ€™s the scale thatâ€™s important in what I do. I keep being dissatisfied with small things, though they can be fun to do at times. I want to do bigger, more massive objects.\\n\\nI never feel so happy as when Iâ€™m quietly working alone. And I have everything here to make my work, the kiln, all. An artist has to be very close to his work. I know when Iâ€™ve been looking in museums, Iâ€™ve often felt that Iâ€™ve known the person whoâ€™s made that object. Perhaps this doing of oneâ€™s own work, oneâ€™s own thing, perhaps this is the link between civilisations. Other civilisations have tried to leave us what they knew.

Soon a lead dancer, he performed with the Royal Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, the New York City Ballet and the American Festival Ballet before returning to Launceston in 1960. There he created Tasmania's first ballet studio, built behind his house in Wellington Street. He ran the Tasmanian Ballet School for many years, from which the performing ensemble known as the Tasmanian Ballet was founded in 1961. Gillespie travelled around Tasmania to give classes. His students included not only Graeme Murphy, who credits him as his mentor, but also Michelle Hawkins, Natasha Middleton, Claire McHugh and Glenn Murray. The Tasmanian Ballet performed and toured around Australia regularly, including in many primary schools, with Gillespie involved in every aspect of all its productions from 1961. By 1975 it was a state and federally funded professional company. Gillespie was its director until he retired in 1979 and moved to Newcastle for the climate. He received a knighthood from the Order of St John of Malta and of Rhodes in 1989."

                "content": "James Gillray, caricaturist and printmaker, was born in Chelsea and learned the art of engraving as a youth in London. After a period with a troupe of strolling players, he began to study at the Royal Academy, paying his way by engraving. He published his first known caricature in 1779. About ten years later, he formed a permanent professional partnership with Hannah Humphrey, publisher and printseller; they were to work together and share accommodation for twenty years. He not only sold his prints through her shop, which prospered accordingly, but depicted her shop (which moved from Old Bond Street, to New Bond Street, to St James Street) in his prints. Many of Gillrayâ€™s cruellest satires were directed at George III and his family. Early in his career he treated Whigs worse than Tories overall (because Tories, being more affluent, were more likely to buy his works), but from 1801 onwards he attacked both sides with equal vigour. Any study of eighteenth-century English life, costume, the Court or politics must turn, at some point, to the works of Gillray, in which the inscriptions constitute a vital complement to the images. Having lost his sight, and having attempted suicide by leaping from the upper window of the print shop, he lapsed into continuous insanity in 1811, to be cared-for by Miss Humphrey until he died in 1815. The Tate Britain mounted a major exhibition of his meticulously hand-coloured works, occupying â€˜a kind of limbo between political history and art historyâ€™, in 2001."

Goldsworthy studied medicine at the University of Adelaide, and after graduating in 1974 worked in drug and alcohol rehabilitation while starting to write. His first book of poetry, _Readings from Ecclesiastes_, won the Commonwealth Poetry Prize for a debut collection, the South Australian Premierâ€™s Award, and was joint winner of the Fellowship of Australian Writersâ€™ Anne Elder Poetry Award in 1982. His first book of short stories, _Bleak Rooms_, was published in 1988 and his debut novel, _Maestro_, appeared the following year. Shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award, _Maestro_ was adapted for the stage in a collaboration between Goldsworthy and his daughter Anna, a concert pianist. Subsequent works include the novels _Honk If You Are Jesus_ (1992), _Wish_ (1995) and _Three Dog Night_ (2003), which won the FAW Christina Stead Award, and _Everything I Knew_ (2008), which was shortlisted for the Prime Ministerâ€™s Literature Award. His works have been translated widely, and four have been adapted for the stage, as has the short story _The Kiss_. Also an essayist and screenwriter, Goldsworthy wrote the libretti for Richard Millsâ€™ operas _Summer of the Seventeenth Doll_ and _Batavia_, the latter winning him and Mills the 2002 Helpmann Award for the best new Australian work, and a Green Room Award for special creative achievement. His most recent collection of short stories, _Gravel_ (2010), was shortlisted for the ASAL Gold Medal. His _Stupid Boyhood: a Memoir_ was published in 2013. The stage adaptation of _Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam_ (1993) is taking place in 2018. _The Minotaur_, his first novel in a decade, and an opera based on the lives of Ned and Ellen Kelly (written with the composer Luke Styles), are appearing in 2019."

Educated at the University of New South Wales and subsequently at the Australian National University, he worked for The Canberra Times as a copy boy before gaining a cadetship at the Macquarie Radio Network. He then became a political correspondent for the ABC, and has since reported on Australian and international news and political affairs for Channel Seven, CNN International, Sky News Australia and SBS, working in London, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Abu Dhabi. He returned to Sydney in 2012 to help launch SBS's NITV. Grant later joined the ABC as the editor of Indigenous Affairs and became Professor of Global Affairs at Griffith University. In 2019, he moved to Doha, Qatar to work with Al Jazeera. Appointed the Vice-Chancellor's Chair of Indigenous Belonging at Charles Sturt University in 2020, he returned to the ABC as International Affairs Analyst. For his journalism and media work Grant has been awarded three Walkleys, a Peabody award and a DuPont award. He has published numerous books including his family memoir _The Tears of Strangers; Talking to My Country_; _Australia Day_; _On Identity_, published in English and Wiradjuri; _Tell it to the World: An Indigenous Memoir_; and _With the Falling of the Dusk_. Grant wrote _The Australian Dream_ (2019), a feature documentary film about the football player Adam Goodes exploring racism, identity and belonging."

In 1969 he won the inaugural AME Bale Scholarship. He took up painting full-time in 1970 with the encouragement of the veteran South Australian portraitist, Sir Ivor Hele. He has been a favourite in both the Archibald Prize â€“ in which he has been a finalist 26 times, and won the People's Choice Award three times â€“ and the Doug Moran Portrait Prize, which he won in 1990. Much in demand as an official portraitist, he painted the Historic Memorials Committee's official prime-ministerial portrait of Paul Keating and the official Centenary of Federation painting that now hangs in Parliament House alongside Tom Roberts' 'Big Picture'. In 2015 the Art Gallery of South Australia showed more than 200 of his works in the solo exhibition _Robert Hannaford_. Hannaford works in a studio in Riverton, where has painted hundreds of portraits, his easel placed beneath a skylight that enables him to exploit the full range of daylight. Enjoying the discipline imposed by a commission, he is open to ideas from his sitters about how they would like to be portrayed, finding that they often lead him into new ways of seeing and composing. 'I can find anything interesting,' he says. 'I could look at the corner of the room and find a painting that could keep me going for ages.' The National Portrait Gallery owns his portraits of Dame Joan Sutherland, Robert Dessaix, Alexander Ramsay, Tim Flannery and Lowitja O'Donoghue, the latter painted on commission."

She later studied art history there, but as a practitioner she is largely self-taught, and has undertaken short courses in painting, life drawing and anatomy at the Adelaide Central School of Art; the Grand Central Atelier and the Art Students League, New York; and at Studio Escalier, France. Also mentored by her father â€“ the distinguished portraitist Robert Hannaford AM â€“ Hannaford has been selected for the Archibald Prize every year since 2015 and has been a finalist for the Portia Geach Memorial Award and the Doug Moran Portrait Prize on multiple occasions. Specialising in portraiture and still life, Hannaford says that, whatever her subject matter, she endeavours to capture 'a certain quietness and stillness'. She has been awarded fellowships and residencies in Australia and overseas and has undertaken official portrait commissions for many clients including Melbourne Girls' Grammar, the Supreme Court of South Australia, the City of Adelaide, and the Government of New South Wales."

                "content": "Nicholas Harding (1956â€“2022) was one of Australia's most highly regarded artists, known for his portraits and drawings, and his light-filled, vigorously painted images of the bush and the coast. Born in London, he came to Australia with his family as a boy and attained a Bachelor of Arts in 1975. After a couple of years travelling in Europe and the UK, he trained as an animator with the cartoon company Hanna Barbera, and then worked as a freelance animator for over twenty years. Meanwhile, he taught himself to paint and was first exhibited in the Sulman Prize in 1980. He held his first solo exhibition with Rex Irwin Art Dealer, Sydney, in 1992, subsequently showing multiple times with Irwin over the next twenty years and exhibiting also with Philip Bacon Galleries, Brisbane and Sophie Gannon Gallery, Melbourne. Harding became known early on for huge pen and ink depictions of the railway tracks and shabby streets of inner Sydney, and the scrubby trees of the beaches of the north coast of New South Wales. His paintings on the same themes, as well as flowers, and beach and river scenes, became much sought-after by collectors. He won the Mosman Art Prize in 1993 and from that year onward featured regularly in the Archibald Prize, the Wynne Prize, the Dobell Drawing Prize, the Sulman Prize and the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize. In 2001, the first of several triumphant years, Harding won the Dobell Prize and triumphed in the Archibald with his _Portrait of John Bell as King Lear_. A major retrospective of his work, _Nicholas Harding: Drawn to Paint_, was exhibited at the SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney in 2010; and the Tweed Regional Gallery presented _Carving Light and Landscape_ in 2015. In 2017 the National Portrait Gallery presented _Nicholas Harding: 28 Portraits_, which encompassed everything from swiftly-executed portraits of anonymous sitters that Harding sketched mid-flight on airline sick bags, to lush, large scale paintings of sitters including writer Robert Drewe and actor Hugo Weaving â€“ both of which are held in the NPGâ€™s collection. \\n\\nHarding held residencies at the CitÃ© des Arts Internationales in Paris (2013) and at Bundanon, New South Wales (1998). His work is represented in private, corporate and public collections internationally and at home, including those of the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Art Gallery of South Australia and the National Portrait Gallery."

She met her future husband Hal Hattam, a Scottish-born Australian obstetrician and artist, while he was in England with the Australian Imperial Force. She started her career in the advertising department of Harrods before returning with Hal to Melbourne, where she found marketing work with Georges, then the city's most fashionable department store. Balancing work with raising her first three children, she quickly rose to the position of advertising manager, where she was at one time said to be the highest-paid woman in Australia. The couple became friends with a group of inner-city intellectuals and aesthetes, and entertained and encouraged many emerging artists who have since become household names. At Kate's behest, artists such as John Perceval, Arthur Boyd and Leonard French designed wrapping paper and greeting cards for Georges, and she is believed to have been influential in securing fair rates of payment for artists engaged in commercial work. The Hattam family homes in Canterbury and South Yarra housed an unrivalled body of works by artists in their circle and beyond, including John Brack, Clifton Pugh, Fred Williams and Sid Nolan, who came to play a substantial role in Australian art in the twentieth century."

He was Australia's longest-serving official war artist, serving in North Africa, the Middle East and New Guinea during the Second World War and in the Korean War. The Australian War Memorial holds the majority of his works, including intimate landscapes, massive battle-pieces and sensitive drawings in chalk. His postwar paintings were occasionally shown at the _Adelaide_ _Advertiser's_ open-air art exhibitions. Although Hele painted landscapes (mostly of the rocky southern coast of South Australia) and made thousands of erotic paintings and drawings, he was best known as a portrait painter. He was much in demand as an official portraitist and won the Archibald Prize five times between 1951 and 1957, notably with his portrait of Sir Robert Menzies in 1954 and a self-portrait in 1957. Despite his success, he rarely exhibited his works and his last solo exhibition was at the 1970 Adelaide Festival of the Arts. Hele is represented in the National Portrait Gallery's collection with his portraits of Dame Nancy Buttfield, Sir Lloyd Dumas and Claude Charlick."

At the age of eleven he made his stage debut, dressed in a tutu, at a charity concert in front of Dame Nellie Melba. Soon after he joined Anna Pavlova's touring company and went to England where by 1934 he was lead male dancer at the Vic-Wells Ballet (later Sadler's Wells). There, he formed a celebrated partnership with Dame Margot Fonteyn. Renowned for his dramatic and innovative ballet choreography, Helpmann was co-director and then director of The Australian Ballet from 1965 to 1976; during this period, in 1965, he was Australian of the Year. He appeared in twelve films, including _The Red Shoes_, which he also choreographed. Renowned for flamboyance and wit, at the age of 60 he performed as Dr CoppÃ©lius in The Australian Ballet's _CoppÃ©lia_ and he was still dancing two months before his death in the role of the Red King in _Checkmate_."

Markova then decided to leave and start her own company with Anton Dolin. And I thought, â€˜Well this is the end of the balletâ€™, when Ninette de Valois said, â€˜Iâ€™ve found a girl that youâ€™re going to dance withâ€™, and took me into the classroom and I said, â€˜Which one?â€™ She said, â€˜That one over there with the two long plaitsâ€™, and I thought, â€˜That funny-looking little girl?â€™ and I said, â€˜Whatâ€™s her name?â€™ and she said, â€˜Peggy Hookhamâ€™, and I said, â€˜Well, thatâ€™s not going to look very good on the notice board is it, Peggy Hookham?â€™ And I said, â€˜She looks Chineseâ€™. And she said, â€˜Well as a matter of fact, she was born in Shanghai but she is English. No, she was born in Reigate and she went to Shanghai as a little girl â€“ I want you to work with herâ€™. And the minute, of course, I saw her dance, I realised that she was absolutely wonderful, and Ninette said, â€˜Sheâ€™s going to change her name, sheâ€™s going to call herself Margot Fonteynâ€™. And so from that moment on, I danced with Fonteyn for 27 years and I suppose we became, at that time, the most famous pair dancing in Europe.\\n\\nIâ€™m always asked what was the most memorable performance or production, and itâ€™s impossible really for me to say, because so many things have been memorable to me. My first appearances with Markova, my first appearances with Fonteyn, my first appearances with Vivienne Leigh, the first time I played _Hamlet_, all of them. I have never felt for one minute in my life, â€˜Iâ€™m a successâ€™. I feel Iâ€™ve accomplished something and that is done and therefore there is something more to do. The success or failure of what has passed has passed and I must go on to something else. And whatever else I may have achieved in life, I hope that people will remember that my whole life has been dedicated to producing something of beauty in the theatre.",

Initially he was in business with Charles Nettleton in a studio on Bourke Street East, but he was working independently by 1866. Examples of his work were included in the Melbourne Intercolonial Exhibition that year, and he was awarded an honourable mention for his 'fancy dress portraits'. Around 1866 or 1867, Hewitt opened his own studio â€“ The Australasian Studio â€“ at 95 Swanston Street, but he declared insolvency in 1878, citing 'falling-off in business, illness in family, and having to pay heavy interest on borrowed money' as the cause of the studio's collapse. He later had a studio in South Melbourne, and in 1892 he moved to Stawell, where he died in 1912. His known works include a suite of carte de visite portraits of members of the first Australian sporting team to tour overseas â€“ the Indigenous cricketers who travelled to England in 1868 â€“ and photographic reproductions of equestrian portraits by Frederick Woodhouse and Thomas Lyttleton, which illustrated the 1871 edition of the _Victorian Stud-Book_."

I couldnâ€™t do it now if I tried! And at that time, Dame Nellie Melba was visiting home and she saw this picture, and she thought it showed great talent and sheâ€™d wanted to give me something to remember her by and her recognition of me. And she gave me my first palette, and that started me off on oil painting, which I really wanted to do. And Iâ€™m still painting on this palette today.\\n\\nI like painting flowers direct. I like to gather a bunch in my hand in the garden, put them in a setting that enhances them, and to paint direct, to get the whole feeling of the bunch in the round.\\n\\nFlowers have always had that fascination for me, because I can remember when I was a war artist right up in the steaming jungle of New Guinea. Iâ€™d arranged myself a beautiful native bowl full of flowers and I was sitting in the mess, painting this, when I had a signal to be moved on down to Lae, and I ignored the signal, and the jeep came along to collect me to take me to the airport, and I said, â€˜Go away, Iâ€™m in the middle of painting flowersâ€™, and I continued with my flowers and got into hot water over this. The signals flew from New Guinea to Melbourne and back, and I was still painting my flowers, refusing to budge.\\n\\nI recall that picture and sticking it out, and I remember painting it on the mess table; I had to move every time a meal was brought forward, and it took me about four or five days to complete it, and Iâ€™ve kept that canvas, I called it _The Flower Sip_ and itâ€™s one picture that didnâ€™t go into the Military History Section. I felt I deserved that one.",

                "content": "Noel Fraser Hickey (1921â€“2010) was born in Kensington, in Sydney, New South Wales, a stone's throw from the Royal Randwick Racecourse. His father, James Hickey, was a violinist, as was his elder brother, Lionel. The family later lived at The Rocks and Noel was educated at Fort Street Boys' School in Petersham. As a schoolboy, he got into the habit of making his way back to Randwick racecourse where he would watch Phar Lap train, sometimes convincing a sympathetic tram conductor to let him catch a ride from Circular Quay for free. He got to know some of the trainers, who let him ride their horses so that he could get a better look at the champion. Hickey got to know Phar Lap's strapper, Tommy Woodcock, too. On race days, he would scramble under a fence in a far corner of the course to watch Phar Lap race. After leaving school, Hickey found work as a photographer with Kodak. He served with the AIF in North Africa and New Guinea in the Second World War.  \\n\\n\\nBy the time he was repatriated to Sydney on medical grounds, Hickey's devotion to Phar Lap was commonly known. He laid a wreath at the entrance to Randwick Racecourse each year on the anniversary of the famed gelding's death, and in 1944 he raised Â£1 from other troops and sent the money back to the _Daily Telegraph_ so that a wreath could be laid on his behalf. Hickey later told a journalist that 'I got into some tight spots in the war. It was the memory of Phar Lap that got me through.' He married for the first time in 1946; he had met his wife, Edna, when she was working as a photographic processor, and they had three children. By the 1950s Hickey appears to have had his own studio, specialising in headshots and portfolio photography for aspiring models from schools such as that run by the former Miss Australia, Pat Woodley (who is also represented in Nancy Menetrey's portrait of Noel Fraser Hickey). Hickey remarried after his divorce from Edna in 1970 and had another son with his second wife, Maree. When that marriage ended, he moved to Western Australia, where he trained racehorses.\\n\\nHickey nevertheless maintained his habit of honouring the anniversary of Phar Lap's death every year; and in 1982 having returned to Sydney, he went so far as to make a new headstone for the horse when the original one went missing. (The original headstone had been donated to the Australian Jockey Club in the 1970s). Hickey lived in Coffs Harbour towards the end of his life, and always arranged for a wreath to be laid when he was unable to lay one himself."

Born in Sydney, Hicks completed a degree in communications at the University of Canberra and then pursued her interest in photography at the ANU School of Art. While earning a living as a commercial photographer, she maintained a private focus on her art photography, and entered various art prizes and exhibitions. In 2003, she won both the Fisher's Ghost Art Award for Contemporary Art in Campbelltown, and the Josephine Ulrick Photography Award for Portraiture in Tweed Heads. Since then, she has been making series of photographs of individuals that strain the definition of portraiture, finding, it has been said, 'beauty in perceived imperfections and render[ing] idealised beauty strange'. She had her first exhibition with Sydneyâ€™s inner-city Stills Gallery in 2005, and the following year the National Portrait Gallery included a series of her immaculate, unsettling photographs in the exhibition _Truth and Likeness_. In 2016 she completed a Master of Fine Arts at the Sydney College of the Arts, where she investigated the connection between humans and animals. Over her career Hicks has been represented in many solo and group exhibitions and her works are included in Australian and international collections. The National Gallery of Victoria held a major exhibition of her work _Petrina Hicks: Bleached Gothic_ in 2019â€“2020."

It makes me, it creates my identity. In my works, I speak about the stories about my grandparents and their connection and how they met. And we believe that through the landscape and through our totems is what brought them together. And that's what I'm presenting through my artwork is the love story of my grandparents. And it's through this dreaming story of the Rock Cod and the Red Kangaroo.\\n\\nI feel a closeness, a close connection when I'm working with clay. And I believe that working with clay connects you to the spiritual connection that we have with the landscape here. I think it's the perfect medium to tell the story, the love story, between the River Rock Cod and the Red Kangaroo. Using the two coloured clay also touches on emotion and feelings as well. And the power of love, of bringing two spiritual beings together\\n\\nIt's different. It's a different medium. When people think about portraits, they think about photography. But for me and my people, we've always seen ourselves in the environment around us, in our landscape. And I think it's very important that the rest of the country, the broader Australia see this and they can get a sense of who we are as Indigenous people from this area. We've always seen ourself in the landscape. We're part of this landscape. It's who we are. It makes up who we are as First Nation people, Indigenous people of this land. And so showing, telling, my story through this medium of clay will give you much more deeper and a sense of connection to what we have to this country. It's part of who we are as people, as Kaantju people from Cape York.",

Born in Sydney to a surfing family, Holmes' parents took her to South Africa when she was three, where they lived for four years. They then lived in Hawaii. She began her career in 1989 with a sports broadcasting cadetship at the ABC Radio, where she hosted Grandstand in the early 1990s. Her job as a media spokesperson for the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games led to a role as co-host of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. This was followed by a position as a sports presenter with Channel Seven, in which role she was the network's face of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Later that year she moved overseas with partner Stan Grant and worked as a sports presenter and broadcaster in Hong Kong and Beijing for China Central TV News, an English language news channel. Returning to Australia in 2006, Holmes was re-appointed as the host for Grandstand. In 2009, Holmes worked for CNN in Abu Dhabi, covering social issues, business and sports in the Middle East; two years later she rejoined China Central TV News in Beijing as an anchor. After moving back to Australia with her family in 2014, Holmes returned to the ABC hosting various radio programs including the award-winning sports program and podcast _The Ticket_. Twice named as a finalist in the Walkley awards, Holmes is a published author, lectures in journalism at the University of Technology, Sydney, and is a senior mentor for the International Olympic Committee's Young Reporters program."

Working for preference in watercolour, which she allows to bleed and drip, Hood specialises in intense depictions of mostly anonymous subjects. With a studio based in the Southern Tablelands of NSW, she has embraced her landscape surrounds, sometimes incorporating it into her figurative works. In 2000, Hood gained her masters degree from Sydney College of the Arts with a thesis comprising an investigation of 'gender politics and cultural mores and taboos surrounding the representation of the male body'. The following year she held her first solo exhibition at Mori Gallery, Sydney. Since then, she has exhibited in solo and group shows in Australia and internationally, including in the National Portrait Gallery's _Contemporary Australian Portraits_ in 2002. Following her Archibald Prize win in 2002 for her portrait, _Simon Tedeschi unplugged_, she won the Kedumba Drawing Award in 2003. Amongst her portrait subjects are painters Matthys Gerber, Ben Quilty and Michael Zavros, and pianist David Helfgott. Her portrait of Tedeschi is one of a number of Archibald winners in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Hood's works are in state collections around Australia and in public and private collections around the world."

Born in Sydney, Hughes was educated at Riverview and Sydney University, although he did not complete a degree. Like many of the figures who floated around the Sydney â€˜Pushâ€™ in the late 1950s, he began his career contributing poems, cartoons, criticism and articles to _Honi Soit_, the _Observer_, and _Nation_. He began working for _Time_ in 1970, the year his _The Art of Australia_ was published, and lived in the USA for the rest of his life. His books and television series include _The Shock of the New_ (1980), _The Fatal Shore_ (1987), _Nothing if Not Critical_ (1990), _American Visions_ (1997) and _A Jerk on One End_ (1999), the latter about fishing. In 1999, just after beginning to film his television series on Australia, _Beyond the Fatal Shore_, Hughes suffered a terrible car accident on the coast of Western Australia. The series was cobbled together during his agonising convalescence, and Hughes had little control over the final cut; it was hostilely reviewed. The accident led to a protracted legal process; three years later, there was still talk of extraditing Hughes from the USA to face charges. His second marriage broke down, and his only son died. Named the _London Sunday Times_ Writer of the Year in 2000, Hughes proceeded to write _Goya_ (2003) and a superb autobiography, _Things I Didnâ€™t Know_ (2006)."

He studied art in Melbourne with Max Meldrum in the early 1940s and also worked for Meldrum as an assistant teacher, becoming a leading exponent of his mentor's theory of perception and the importance of tonal and space relations between objects. After Meldrum's death, Inson moved to Sydney and established a studio in Rowe Street. He held his first solo exhibition in 1954 and in 1955 he opened his own art school. One of the most successful 'Meldrumites', he painted landscapes and still life as well as portraits, travelling widely to paint and holding scores of solo exhibitions in Sydney into the 1990s. \\n\\nInson was commissioned for many official portraits and was twice a finalist in the Doug Moran prize. He entered 41 works in the Archibald Prize between 1952 and 1979. The National Portrait Gallery acquired his 1980 portrait of Gough Whitlam in 2002, his 1953 portrait of Brian Fitzpatrick in 2008; his 1951 portrait of Max Meldrum in 2009; and his portrait of Kevin Weldon in 2012. In 2014, the NPG acquired Inson's painting of his life partner, the artist Ivy Shore."

                "content": "Akira Isogawa (b. 1964), fashion designer, was born in Kyoto, Japan, and first came to Australia on a working holiday at the age of 21. Excited by what he saw as the country's 'fresh and youthful spirit,' he moved here permanently, working as a waiter by night while studying fashion design at East Sydney TAFE. In 1993 he opened the Akira Isogawa boutique in Woollahra, and swiftly established a reputation for his bold and intelligent clothes. At Sydney's Australian Fashion Week in 1996, he sent all his models out wearing red socks from Gowings because he couldn't afford shoes for them; but he has shown at most Australian Fashion Weeks since, and since 1998 he has shown twice annually in Paris. He has exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art and has featured in the Powerhouse Museum's Fashion of the Year retrospective. Object Gallery's exhibition of his construction techniques in Sydney is said to have been its most successful ever show. At 1999's Australian Fashion Industry Awards he was named Designer of the Year and Womenswear Designer of the Year. The National Gallery of Victoria's _Akira Isogawa: Printemps EtÃ©_ in 2004â€“2005 was the first solo exhibition of an Australian designer's work to be shown at a major art institution and later toured to Singapore, Manila, Bangkok, New Delhi and Mumbai. In 2005 Isogawa was depicted on the 'Australian Legends' series of stamps issued by Australia Post and in 2007 he was named the country's first Fashion Laureate. A regular collaborator with choreographer Graeme Murphy, he designed costumes for The Australian Ballet's _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Murphy_, and for the Sydney Dance Company productions of _Salome_, _Air and Other Invisible Forces_, _Ellipse_ and _Grand_. Also known for his unique textiles, Isogawa's designs have appeared on collections for Designer Rugs and Woven Images. Sydney's Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences showed the retrospective _Akira Isogawa_ in 2018â€“2019 and his work was included in the Victoria and Albert Museum's 2020 exhibition _Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk_ in London."

Well now actually I create fashion. But back then, actually, I was consuming fashion and that's how much I loved [it].  \\nJapanese culture is so different from Western ones. My grandparents had a house next door. They were all wearing actually traditional clothes â€“ kimono. What I noticed about kimono is actually they're made out rectangular shaped cloth. And they have no shapes. Whereas actually, Western clothes has a particular shape that enhance, particularly actually for female, the femininity of female body, but whereas actually kimono is totally unisex. I mean, I've never actually designed kimono myself. But being a kimono designer, I imagine actually, they work on texture, colour, print, and so on, because it's a highly textile driven fashion, and then to me, that's what Japanese fashion is all about. You know, when I design my own collection, I never really force myself to express my Japanese entity, but I feel that it just comes up naturally. And I think what's interesting is that not just, you know, designing something so traditionally Japanese, but then I kind of actually manage to fuse with Australian ease I guess actually. Australia has got this particular attitude â€“ friendly to start with â€“ but it's quite actually casual about things, you know. I feel actually my design is a result of actually, you know, some Japanese heritage with Australian attitude, which is actually friendly and easy.",

In 1946 he became attached to the architectural school of the Prague Academy of Fine Arts, but just weeks before he was due to graduate, he fled communist Czechoslovakia to live as a displaced person in West Germany. In 1950 he emigrated to Australia on a labour contract. Initially working in Melbourne, laying track, the cultivated Praguer ended up on the Eucumbene Dam site. Some time before 1955 he met the artist Lina Bryans, and they began a lifelong relationship. Prickly with prospective clients, Jelinek was a visionary of genius, drawing brilliant designs for far more structures than he ever realised. For Bryansâ€™s second cousin, Canberra academic Bruce Benjamin, he carried out the spiral â€˜Round Houseâ€™ in Gawler Crescent, Deakin, which was named Australian House of the Year in 1957 and is now heritage-listed. In 1962 he designed a roadhouse at Peregian Beach that was converted to a motel before it was knocked down in 2003. Otherwise, his modifications to Bryansâ€™s two Melbourne houses were his only solid architectural contributions. His huge sculpture, Quill (1974) and some aluminium furniture he designed are now in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria."

Jerrems grew up in suburban Melbourne and studied art and design under Paul Cox at the Prahran Technical School between 1967 and 1970. Having won a number of awards for her photographs, including an Institute of Australian Photographers Award in 1970, Jerrems trained as a teacher and worked at technical colleges in Melbourne and, later, Hobart. She began exhibiting in the early 1970s at venues such as Brummels Gallery, Melbourne; the National Gallery of Victoria; the Arts Council Gallery, Sydney; and, later, the Australian Centre for Photography. Works such as _Vale Street_ (1975) are considered emblematic of 1970s counter-culture in Australia, not only for their documentation of people involved in spheres such as activism and creativity but specifically for their evocation of the spirit and aspirations that informed the lives and pursuits of her sitters. During the 1970s, Jerrems also completed commissions for clients such as Macquarie University; was awarded grants by the Australia Council and the Australian Film Commission; and worked for a period as a yoga instructor at an ashram north of Sydney. In 1979, Jerrems became ill with Budd Chiari Syndrome, a rare liver disease, and spent several months in hospital in Hobart undergoing treatment. She died in Melbourne in February 1980, a few weeks short of her 31st birthday. The National Gallery of Australia held touring exhibitions _Living in the 70s: Photographs by Carol Jerrems_ in 1990â€“1991 and _Carol Jerrems: Photographic Artist_ in 2013â€“2014. Heide Museum of Modern Art staged _Up Close: Carol Jerrems with Larry Clark, Nan Goldin and William Yang_ in 2010."

After training as a tailor in Vienna, at twenty Kahan moved to Paris, where he worked for the couturier Paul Poiret, first as a tailor and then a designer. In 1939, he enlisted in the Foreign Legion; as the war progressed he worked for the American Red Cross, making thousands of glamorous portraits of wounded servicemen in French and American hospitals in North Africa. After the war he returned to Paris and worked as an illustrator for Le Figaro, but in 1947 he came to Australia. He settled in Melbourne in 1950. Soon after he arrived the editor of Meanjin, Clem Christesen, asked him to make a series of pen and ink portraits of writers for the journal. Critic Robert Nelson wrote that these portraits 'stand tall in the great tradition of intellectual homage: direct, well observed, economical, even brusque'. Over the next fifty years his pen and ink portraits were hung in many Melbourne homes, while he continued to experiment with techniques and fields of activity. The Jewish Museum held a Kahan retrospective in 1997, comprising portraits, stained glass, drawings, paintings, prints, costume and set designs and ephemera. A selection of his war drawings was shown at the Australian Embassy in Washington in 2005. Kahan won the Archibald Prize in 1962 with a startling portrait of Patrick White."

In 1977 she was a founding member of the Utopia Women's Batik Group and collaborated in the production of batik, an important industry for the Anmatyerre after they regained land title. Kngwarreye began to paint on canvas late in life, in 1988. She held her first solo exhibition in 1990 at Utopia Art Sydney, and her popularity grew. During her brief career she produced thousands of canvases depicting the flowers, roots, dust and summer rains of her Country, the translucent colours built up with layered touches of paint to create an illusion of depth and movement. After her death in 1996, Kngwarreye's work represented Australia at the 1997 Venice Biennale. In 1998 a retrospective exhibition, _Alhalkere: Paintings from Utopia_, travelled to three state galleries and the National Gallery of Australia. Ten years later _Utopia: The Genius of Emily Kame Kngwarreye_, an exhibition of 120 of the artist's works, showed in Osaka and Tokyo. With that exhibition, Kngwarreye was recognised as one of the very greatest abstract artists of the twentieth century."

Having been persuaded to remain in the country to accompany Australian singers Ella Caspers and Peter Dawson, between 1917 and 1920 he was orchestral pianist and conductor for several operas directed by Count Filippini, and for three years from 1920 he led a trio in the restaurant of Farmer's department store. Soon after, he became involved in the formation of the ABC. During the 1920s he and his wife, soprano Janet le Brun Brown, began their long broadcasting careers; except for a short break in 1930 when he returned to England to work for the BBC as a conductor, he was associated with the ABC until he died. From 1933, when Keats began composing in earnest, he wrote more than 120 pieces. In 1934 he began setting the work of Australian poets to music. In 1936 he commenced a series of settings of Christopher Brennan's poems, to which he had been granted exclusive rights during his lifetime. These came to be regarded as some of his finest compositions. Amongst his other productions are some film scores."

She met Horace Keats in Sydney, and after hearing her sing at the New Zealand Soldiers Rest Room, he determined to make her his wife. They were married in 1918, and were to live at various addresses in Mosman throughout their lives together. Always addressed as 'Mrs Keats' by their friends, under the name of Barbara Russell she became the principal performer of his songs; he described her as his critic and guide. In 1946, the year after Keats died, Janet married the poet Hugh McRae; their marriage was dissolved two years later."

In Melbourne, he and his pub band The Dots made two albums before breaking up in 1982. He recorded _Post_ in Sydney in 1985, but his major break came the following year, by which time his band was known as The Coloured Girls. Their double album _Gossip_ was one of the biggest Australian records of 1986. The band made _Under the Sun_ (1987) before touring the US as Paul Kelly and the Messengers. They disbanded in 1991, and from that point Kelly branched into producing and acting as well as writing and performing. Kelly sings with a marked Australian accent and many of his songs refer to specific Australian people, places and experiences.\\n\\nThough he has written most of his long and poetic songlist alone, over the course of his 27 studio albums has also collaborated brilliantly, particularly with First Nations performers such as Kev Carmody, Christine Anu and Yothu Yindi. His self-described 'mongrel memoir', _How to Make Gravy_, was released in 2010 and Ian Darling's film _Paul Kelly: Stories of Me_ appeared in 2012. In 2013 Kelly was the subject of a biographical exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. The winner of seventeen ARIA awards, he was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1997. His 2019 greatest hits album _Songs from the South_ debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, his third number one album in three years (the others were _Life is Fine_ and _Nature_)."

He trained for a naval career in England, and subsequently became skilled in surveying. In 1817 he was appointed to explore the Australian coastline to consolidate the earlier work of Matthew Flinders. Over five years he made four difficult voyages, charting many gulfs, identifying several islands, and providing the first reports of Port Darwin. He was accompanied on the early voyages by Bungaree. In 1826, regarded as one of Britain's leading hydrographers, he sailed in the company of the _Beagle_ to chart Peru, Chile and Patagonia. From 1832 onwards King was an agricultural administrator, although he was promoted rear admiral on the retired list in 1855. He continued to take an interest in exploration and published many volumes on his investigations in New South Wales."

After Cook was killed and Charles Clerke, who had transferred from the Discovery to command the Resolution, died of tuberculosis, King commanded the Discovery on the voyage home. It was King who completed the account of the third voyage, working at Woodstock, near Oxford. In 1782, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society for his astronomical observations.

A founding member of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo in 1932, four years later she toured Australia with the company as a leading dancer, turning in sparkling performances in _Petrouchka_ and _Le Carnaval_. At the end of the tour in 1937 she went back to England but returned early in 1938 to marry the Danish Vice-Consul in Sydney, Erik Fischer. In 1940 she began a ballet school in Sydney, and the following year she established the Kirsova Ballet. She employed several dancers who had stayed in Australia following the Ballets Russes tours to Australia, including Tamara Tchinarova, and took on some young Australian dancers who would later have significant careers, such as Rachel Cameron, Strelsa Heckelman, Paul Hammond and Peggy Sager. An important patron of Australian artists, composers and set designers, Kirsova commissioned designs for her original ballets from artists such as Loudon Sainthill, Amie Kingston, Alice Danciger and Wolfgang Cardamatis. The Kirsova Ballet folded in 1944, but Kirsova kept her school running until she retired to Europe in the late 1940s."

A significant contemporary artist, Knight has been a finalist in the Archibald Prize multiple times including with portrait of Jason Phu in 2019, a self-portrait in 2009, Bob Carr in 2007, his grandfather Sir Harold Knight in 2006 and Richard Gill in 2005. Knight holds a Bachelor of Arts (Electronic and Temporal Art) from Sydney College of the Arts, University of Sydney and a Master of Arts (Painting and Drawing) from the College of Fine Arts, University of NSW. He won the 2008 Mosman Art Prize and the 2015 Art Sulman Prize, and has held many exhibitions in Australia, London, Berlin and Beijing."

He lived on his uncle's north-west NSW farm, working as a jackeroo and becoming friendly with Breaker Morant and Banjo Paterson before coming to Sydney to work as an illustrator for the _Bulletin_. He studied at the Julian Ashton Art School in Sydney from 1896 to 1900, when winning the first NSW Travelling scholarship enabled him to spend a year in Paris. He was successful both there and in London, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy and the New Salon and gained a reputation as a raconteur and man about town. During the First World War, as the only official war artist to be appointed to the rank of Honorary Captain, he produced immense, violent paintings of the landing at Gallipoli and the charge of the Light Horse at Beersheba. When he returned to Sydney in 1921 he was the most glittering figure of the art world, and between 1920 and 1930 his paintings dominated the Australian art scene. At the same time, he encouraged a new generation of modernist artists such as Thea Proctor, Roy de Maistre, Roland Wakelin and Grace Cossington Smith. Toward the end of his life, with his pupil Arthur Murch, he created the figure of the unknown soldier in St Mary's Basilica, Sydney. For Sydney's Domain he also made the statue of another old acquaintance, Henry Lawson, a work, like his war paintings, that has significantly influenced notions of Australian identity. He won the Wynne Prize in 1899, the Archibald Prize in 1927, and was an Associate of the Royal Academy."

And I wanted to write a theatre that was different, had all different forms of acting in it whether it be music, dance, singing, a monologue. And I wanted to stay in the traditional way of storytelling but make it real, make it different. And the only way, and the only way I can do stories like that was to fall back on myself and my plays, like â€˜You know, youâ€™ve got a story yourself, youâ€™ve been to Alaska when you were 16, you know, you lived here, you lived there, youâ€™ve come from Christmas Creek station, youâ€™ve come up from nowhere and make a name for yourself in the acting world and that is an achievement for someone my age. And I never really thought about it because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m anything special. I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m still quite naive in that aspect.\\n\\nI wanted to make it honest too, â€˜cos you look at a lot of Aboriginal people that are working out there, thereâ€™s a lot of Aboriginal women that are working but not really strong Aboriginal womenâ€™s stories. And I wanted to make my point of view as a woman and as a proud Aboriginal woman, proud of where I come from, whether than be the backblocks of Woop Woop but yet that place still has a very big significance for me. I wanted to make Australia realise that they do have an Indigenous culture in Australia. They have it here. No, no, and Australia doesnâ€™t need to go anywhere else and adopt someone elseâ€™s Indigenous culture which a lot of people tend to do. But, you know, they have it here. And nobody hasnâ€™t discovered it, itâ€™s so funny going to Europe, for me, and more European people know more about Aboriginal Australia than Australians do so which is quite sad, which is really really quite sad. It goes to show how ignorant white Australia is.",

After serving in the AIF during the First World War he settled in Warrandyte and began to write for the Bulletin and other publications. During the 1930s, he studied at George Bell's Bourke Street school and was a frequent visitor to Bell's studio; over that decade he held eight exhibitions in Melbourne and became an office-bearer in Bell's Contemporary Artists Group. Along with Sidney Nolan, Lawlor was singled out by Bell as an artist who 'dared to think for [himself]'. In 1939, more than 200 of his paintings were destroyed in a fire at his Warrandyte home. Subsequently, he established his reputation as a critic in print and on the wireless, over which he broadcast his opinions on art from 1936 to 1951. Following the death of his wife and the failure of his novel, _The Horned Capon_ (1949) Lawlor went into sad decline. Although fewer than sixty of his paintings are known to have survived, he is represented in the National Gallery of Australia and several state and regional galleries."

The son of a Bristol innkeeper, Lawrence was precociously talented and by age 10 his pastel portraits were the main source of his family's income. By the time he was 13, his family had settled in Bath, where Lawrence earned a good income from portraits of the spa town's fashionable inhabitants. Soon after, he began painting in oils and went to London, enrolling in the Royal Academy in 1787. With the death of Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1792, Lawrence became the most sought-after portraitist in England. Appointed principal painter to the courts of George III and George IV, his sitters included numerous British royals and those of Europe, as well as many of society's notables, including Joseph Banks, Lord Melbourne and the Duke of Wellington. The National Portrait Gallery, London, which holds numerous examples of his work, describes Lawrence as having 'the temperament and flair to capture the glamour of the age â€¦ with dazzling brushwork and an innovative use of colour.' He became a member of the Royal Academy in 1794 and was knighted in 1815. \\n\\nThe National Portrait Gallery has eight prints made after paintings by Lawrence, representing such figures as Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool; the Rt Honorable Lord Hawkesbury; and William Lamb, Baron Melbourne."

                "content": "Percy Leason, artist, illustrator and cartoonist, grew up in Victoria's Wimmera region and trained in the rudiments of art in Nhill. In 1907 he was apprenticed to the Melbourne printers Sands & McDougall as a lithographic artist. There he met Richard McCann, with whom he attended evening classes at the NGV school in the evenings; together, they produced the poster for Carlton Breweries, 'I allus has one at eleven'. In 1911 Leason set up an art studio with McCann, William Frater and others, making a precarious living through book illustration and commissions. In 1917 he moved to Sydney to take up a contract with the publishers Smith & Julius. Successful book illustration and inclusion in the 1918 Society of Artists exhibition brought him to the attention of artist and teacher Julian Rossi Ashton; both Ashton and the Art Gallery of New South Wales acquired his work and he soon took the place of political cartoonist David Low at the Bulletin. He worked stably as an illustrator, cartoonist and artist until 1924, when perturbed by the 'new wave' of Modernism sweeping Sydney, he sought solace in Melbourne. There, he was introduced to Max Meldrum, who espoused a theory of tonal objective painting which accorded with his own views. The men's relationship, at times tinged by professional jealousy, was of considerable benefit to both in the formulation of their respective and at times mutual tenets of painting. Upon Leason's return to Sydney, Keith Murdoch offered him a contract cartooning for Punch, based in Melbourne. Henceforth Australia's highest-paid cartoonist, he built a home in Eltham which became a hub for Melbourne artists, writers and performers. When Punch was absorbed into the society journal Table Talk in 1925, Leason continued to provide cartoons for it as well as the Bulletin. His 'Wiregrass' cartoon, illustrating humorous aspects of life in a fictitious country town, appeared in Table Talk from 1926 to 1937. \\n\\nIn 1929 Leason provided illustrations and a model of a rock shelter containing Aboriginal paintings for the National Museum of Victoria's Aboriginal Art Exhibition. Through his role in the exhibition he met anthropologist Donald Thomson, and in 1934, on a field trip with Thomson and other colleagues, he completed twenty-eight portraits of Aboriginal people from Lake Tyers. \\n\\nIn 1938 Leason moved to the USA and settled in Staten Island, where he exhibited and became President of the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences. At his art school, the Modern Perceptual School of Painting, he, his wife and daughter conducted virtually round-the-clock art classes for the community in realist tonal painting. The school continued in various guises until 1955. During these years Leason undertook many commissions, and he won the Audubon Society's Hollander Prize in 1945. He joined the artists' society the Salmagundi Club, and became an elected member of the Royal Art Society in London. Having continued to illustrate, teach and exhibit throughout the 1950s, in 1957 he travelled to Europe for the first time, to view cave art. He published his observations on cave paintings in the journals of the British Medical Association and the Staten Island Institute; plaster models and drawings from tracings he made in France are in the State Library of Victoria."

His first real acting job came in a low budget movie called Blackrock (1997), which was followed by the equally minor Sweat (1996). He had a short stint in the teledrama Home and Away in (1998) Two Hands (1999) offered him a more challenging role and led to higher profile lead roles in bigger budget films such as 10 things I Hate About You (1999) and The Patriot (2000). He was on his way with the starring role in A Knights Tale (2000) a suitable vehicle for his appealing boyish looks. Ned Kelly (2003) his next big film, flopped badly, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath recovered with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005), for which he was nominated for an Oscar and a BAFTA. Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment."

Born in Sydney, Lester studied at the National Art School and the Alexander Mackie College between 1971 and 1975. She held her first solo exhibition in 1976 and featured regularly in group exhibitions including the Wynne and Sulman prizes and the Mosman Art Prize, which she won in 2011. Her bold and distinctive portraits, in which the outlines of the sitters are hand-stitched, were contenders for the Archibald Prize at least sixteen times and, from 1988 until her death in 2016, she figured in the Portia Geach Memorial Award shortlist nine times, her sitters including Phillip Noyce, Judy Cassab, Jeffrey Smart, Akira Isogawa, Jimmy Barnes, Margaret Fink and Trent Nathan. Her _Self-portrait as a Bridesmaid_ took out the Archibald's Packing Room Prize in 1998. Lesterâ€™s painting of athlete Cathy Freeman was among the first 50 works acquired for the National Portrait Gallery's collection. Art historian Gavin Fry has suggested that 'the appeal of Kerrie Lester's work lies in the way it embodies both the serious and the whimsical, the fleeting and the solid, the wry smile with instant recognition of our own weaknesses and excesses'."

London-born, Lewis had worked as a surveyor and draftsman for almost fifteen years before being appointed to a position in the office of the Surveyor-General of New South Wales, Thomas Mitchell. Lewis assisted Mitchell in surveying areas of the Great Dividing Range and, at Mitchellâ€™s instigation, was appointed New South Wales Government Architect in 1835. During his fifteen year tenure in this role, Lewis oversaw the implementation of an ambitious program of public works, designing churches, schools, police stations, courthouses and prisons, as well as residences. Examples of his buildings include the courthouses and gaols at Darlinghurst and Berrima; the Customs House at Circular Quay; the Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum (now known as Gladesville Hospital); the Kingâ€™s School, Parramatta; and Richmond Villa, constructed beside the Domain as Lewisâ€™s private residence in 1849, but relocated to Millers Point in the 1970s. Lewis also supervised the construction of Sydneyâ€™s Government House, designed in London by Edward Blore and comlpeted in 1845. Lewis resigned as Government Architect in 1849 pending an official enquiry that was to find that he had misappropriated materials intended for the first Australian Museum. Of his and Elizabethâ€™s five children, three â€“ sons Oswald, Mortimer junior and Frederick â€“ became architects. Lewis went into private practice with Oswald for a time. He died in Sydney in March 1879. During the 1830s, Mortimer Lewis acquired seventeen acres of coastal land in what is now the Sydney suburb of Bronte. Lewis commenced building a villa on the property â€“ Bronte House â€“ but managed to complete only the dining and drawing rooms before being forced to sell in 1843. The house was completed for the new owners, politician Robert Lowe and his wife, Georgiana, in 1845. Opinions vary on whether these portraits of Mortimer and Elizabeth Lewis were painted in England before they left for Australia, or are the work of a colonial artist. They remained in the collection of the Lewis family until being purchased by Leo Schofield, then the occupant of Bronte House, in 1998. They hung in Bronte House until gifted by Schofield to the National Portrait Gallery in 2002."

I donâ€™t use pencil or crayons very often, I like to use a brush with a very thin medium, and I draw it in onto the canvas and then I do a lot of blocking in, and then I like to have my sitter back when Iâ€™ve done all the preparing, and then paint with my sitter present.\\n\\nSometimes, of course, I come into very difficult problems because my models havenâ€™t got as much time as they â€“ as I â€“ would need and I try and do as much without them from memory and occasionally have to have a photo taken, and try and do a little from that. But I donâ€™t think you can ever get the colour and the feeling trying to ever paint from a photograph. You must have the live person there and you get some inspiration from them as youâ€™re working, I think on portraiture anyway.\\n\\nI like to have my portraits with a feeling that they are casual and not in every detail, because sometimes I think I feel as if theyâ€™re overworked and have a very tight feeling about them. I like the loose flowing feelings and a little bit of softness and a little bit of imagination left to it.",

Born in Sydney, the youngest of seven children to a single mother, Little started making her own clothes as a child. At the age of 36 and eight months pregnant with daughter Katie, she was photographed in her unconventional elephant-print maternity dress for _The Daily Mirror_. Producers saw the image and invited her to appear on the _Mike Walsh Show_. Her guest spot quickly turned into a regular role, where she appeared twice a week in her own outrageous designs and showing her natural flair for comedy. She won a Gold Logie for most popular television personality just two years after her first appearance and was soon the highest paid woman on Australian television. In 1985 she continued on its successor _Midday with Ray Martin_ and was later a regular panellist on _Beauty and the Beast_ until the mid-2000s. She also had a successful career in musical theatre and toured for years with her one-woman show, _Marlene â€“ A tribute to Dietrich_. Little died in 2020 after a decade-long battle with Alzheimer's Disease."

Educated at Cranbrook School, David L Jones (as he called himself) was seventeen when his father began preparing him as his successor. David was sent to work in David Jones' London office and to learn about textiles in Manchester before spending some time as a salesman in the toy department at Harrods. He then undertook a year-long executive training course at Macy's in New York. He is said to have acquired a taste for modern art while he was there. Returning to Sydney in 1951, he was put in charge of the first floor of David Jones' flagship Elizabeth Street premises and subsequently became manager of it, and of the stores in Perth and Wagga Wagga. He married Rosemary Turnbull in 1953; in 1954, aged 23, he became the youngest director of David Jones in the firm's history. A profile which appeared in the _Australian Women's Weekly_ in January 1957 noted that he usually took the tram to work from his terrace house in Woollahra, and that his salary 'has always erred on the meagre side' because that was the way he wanted it. 'A tireless worker', he was said to be at work each day well before opening time, and was 'still there at night when the doors are closed after the last of the customers have scurried from the store.'\\n\\nA councilor of the Retail Traders Association, he became an alderman of the City of Sydney in 1956, representing the Civic Reform Association. He was also a member of the Board of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, the Sydney Chamber of Commerce and the Swedish Chamber of Commerce, and was a founding member of the council of the Art Gallery Society of New South Wales. He became Deputy Chairman and joint Managing Director of David Jones Ltd following his father's death in 1958; in 1960, he was appointed Chairman. Hailed as Australia's most successful young businessman, at the time of his death, aged 30, in June 1931, David Jones employed more than 8000 people and had an annual turnover of thirty-nine million pounds."

Becoming friends with the Australian expatriate impressionist John Russell, he met Toulouse-Lautrec and others, but his own style remained conservative and he exhibited at the Salon and the RA in the early 1890s. 'Tall, handsome and charming', according to his biographer Leigh Astbury, 'Longstaff moved effortlessly in society circles where his skills as a portraitist were eagerly sought'. Indeed, his sitters included King Edward and Queen Alexandra. In London in 1907 he completed his colossal Arrival of Burke, Wills and King at the deserted camp at Cooper's Creek, Sunday evening, 21st April 1861, now in the collection of the NGV. During World War I he painted many portraits of leading Australian military figures (his cousin, Will Longstaff, painted some of the iconic paintings of the Australian War Memorial, as well as the portrait of Walter Lindrum now owned by the National Portrait Gallery). John Longstaff's 1923 painting of Nellie Melba was presented to the NGV from Melba's estate in 1932. John Longstaff won the Archibald Prize five times between 1925 and 1935; during this period, in 1928, he was knighted. From 1927 until his death in Melbourne in 1941 he was a trustee of the NGV."

Her delicate, yet disturbing paintings are characteristically made using an airbrush and a restricted palette of soft, pastel colours. In 2008, she won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize for a self-portrait in the Belanglo State Forest, the site of a series of murders in the mid-1990s. In 2010 her work was included in Wilderness: Balnaves contemporary: painting at the Art Gallery of NSW. She was a finalist in the 2011 Archibald Prize with a portrait of artist Tim Silver and in 2012 she had works in the Wynne and Sulman Prizes. In 2013 she won the Fleurieu Prize with a landscape of the Shoalhaven and was highly commended in the Archibald with a portrait of Shaun Gladwell; in 2014 she won the Archibald with a portrait of Penelope Seidler."

After returning to Australia in 1968 he taught English at the University of Sydney and began to publish poetry â€“ his first collection was the 1970 volume Bicycle and Other Poems. His first novel, the acclaimed Johnno, appeared in 1975. Since turning to writing full-time in 1977 Malouf has published five further books of poetry, three libretti â€“ including an adaptation of Patrick Whiteâ€™s Voss (1978) for the Australian Opera â€“ and an autobiography, 12 Edmonstone Street (1985). He is best known, however, for his novels. An Imaginary Life won the 1979 NSW Premierâ€™s Literary Award; Fly Away Peter won the Age Book of the Year Award in 1982; The Great World won the Miles Franklin Award in 1990; Remembering Babylon was shortlisted for 1994â€™s Booker Prize; The Conversations at Curlow Creek was nominated for the 1997 Miles Franklin Award. His non-fiction essays include On Experience (2008) and The happy life (2011). He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2008. His most recent book, Ransom (2009) retelling the last eight books of the Iliad, is already on the Victorian school syllabus. Having divided his time between residences in Australia and Tuscany for some years, he now mostly lives in Sydney."

That is, you know, the place the writing comes from is somewhere different from your social self.\\n\\nWhen youâ€™re a writer you have to discover how your own imagination works and how you can recreate on the page something that will stir the readerâ€™s imagination in the same way. Of course, because itâ€™s language thatâ€™s very, very much to do with rhythm and with cadence and things like that and I donâ€™t make a distinction between how important rhythm is in say poetry to how important it is in prose as well. And I think of almost everything I write, including the short stories or novels or even a piece of non-fictional prose, I think of that as being, when Iâ€™m writing it, as being something that will be read aloud, and read aloud in the readerâ€™s mind even if they donâ€™t think that thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re doing.\\n\\nI grew up in a generation where our visual imagination was absolutely stimulated and decided by film.

A veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, Marlay came to Australia with his family around 1825, and by the time of Stokesâ€™s visit was the barrack master-general in Sydney. Stokes and Fanny Jane Marlay married in Sydney in January 1841. Later the same year, Stokes succeeded Wickham to the command of the Beagle. Their daughter, Fanny Anne, was born in 1842 at The Vineyard, Parramatta, (the home of Phillip Parker Kingâ€™s brother-in-law), where Fanny Jane was living while the Beagle continued its survey of the Australian coast. Back in England between 1843 and 1847, Stokes â€“ whose 18 years on the Beagle had made him its longest-serving officer â€“ published his two-volume account of its third voyage, Discoveries in Australia (1846). Promoted to captain and appointed to the command of the Acheron in 1847, Stokes sailed south again to undertake the first full hydrographical survey of New Zealand. Fanny Jane died in South Africa while en route to Sydney with Stokes in 1848."

At the age of six he contracted infantile paralysis (polio) which left him permanently disabled. When he was a teenager his family moved to Melbourne, where he wrote with great dedication from the early 1920s and worked as an accountant at a shoe factory from 1930 to 1935. In 1933 he won the first of his three Australian Literary Society Short Story Awards. At last, in 1934, one of his stories was published; from then on he wrote for _Workerâ€™s Voice_, the _Communist Review_ and the _Left Review_; _Smithâ€™s Weekly_, the _Bulletin_, _ABC Weekly_, _Bohemia_ and _Meanjin_. He edited the anti-fascist review _Point_ and was president of the Victorian Writersâ€™ League; though he never joined the Communist Party, he attracted the interest of ASIO immediately upon its formation in 1949. _These Are My People_, stories he collected while travelling with his wife Olive in a horse-drawn caravan through Victoria, was published in 1944; his encounters with Aboriginal people on two trips north were published as _Ourselves Writ Strange_ in 1948. During the 1950s he wrote a regular advice column for the _Argus_. The vicissitudes and triumphs of his childhood are detailed in his best-known, autobiographical work, _I Can Jump Puddles_ (1955), the first volume of a trilogy. The book sold more than 3 million copies and was translated into many languages; it was made into an award-winning film in Czechoslovakia in 1970 and an Australian television series in 1981. Living in the artistsâ€™ enclave of Eltham from 1955, Marshall continued to write prolifically, including popular tales of the imaginary Speewah station, but his autobiographical works gradually darkened in tone until his friend and publisher Frank Cheshire refused to bring out _Hammers Over the Anvil_ (which eventually appeared in 1975). Marshall was made OBE in 1972, received the Soviet Order of Friendship in 1977 and was made AM in 1981. Late in life he worked on projects highlighting various challenges confronting people with disabilities. He is commemorated in the annual Alan Marshall Award for Literature, the award for childrenâ€™s literature in the Victorian Premierâ€™s Literary Awards and the annual Alan Marshall Award in Eltham Shire, Victoria."

When I won a competition, I imagined I must be good, and yet I couldnâ€™t get them published. So I had to keep on and I remember one of the stories that I won a prize with was called _A Little Son_ and it was a story of my mother away outback and it described the birth of one of my sisters. And she told me the story and it won the Australian Literature Societyâ€™s short story competition for one year and I had to read it out aloud. And I brought my mother in to listen to it; she was a very wonderful person. And there Iâ€™m describing how she had knotted towels at the head of her bed and while she was lying on this bed, away outback, with a blowing dust and the hessian above her head, and where father sometimes used to pierce it with a knife and catch the dust in a bucket; sheâ€™s lying there and she said â€˜All that I could rememberâ€™, she told me, very vividly, â€˜was the smell of the Myall wood stockwhip handle that was hanging at the end of the bedâ€™.\\n\\nSo I wrote that story and I liked it, but people seemed rather shocked at it at the time, to motherâ€™s astonishment. And I remember some woman coming up to her there and saying â€˜Your son must be marriedâ€™, and she said â€˜No, heâ€™s not, heâ€™s telling about meâ€™.\\n\\nWhen I began working in the city, that was the sad time of my life. See I think that when youâ€™re crippled, childhood is fairly happy. It is not the affliction that makes life hard but the attitude of people towards it, and this manifests itself very strongly in your teens. That is the time when you want to grab a girl. And Iâ€™ve described this period, although not very well Iâ€™m afraid, in In _Mine Own Heart_.\\n\\nWhat I wanted to do was to describe how I broke through this feeling of restriction, of sadness, and I succeeded in doing it but I havenâ€™t quite succeeded in doing it as I wanted to do in my books. I have one more to write at the time of speaking and that will describe that period of my life when I moved round with artists and writers and when I became much more confident in myself.",

Having weathered harassment from both schoolmates and teachers for his love of dance, at seventeen he left for Melbourne and further training at the Australian Ballet School. He joined the Australian Ballet in 1983, won bronze at the Fifth International Ballet Competition in Moscow in 1985, and was promoted to principal artist with the company in 1989. Working under successive artistic directors Maina Gielgud and Ross Stretton, McAllister's major roles included those in _Onegin_, _Romeo and Juliet_, _La Fille mal gardee_, _Don Quixote_, _The Sentimental Bloke_, _Coppelia_, _Manon_, _La Sylphide_, _Sinfonietta_ and _Stepping Stones_. As a guest artist he has danced with the Bolshoi Ballet, the Kirov Ballet, the National Ballet of Canada, the Birmingham Royal Ballet and the Singapore Dance Theatre, among other companies. After making his final appearance as dancer in _Giselle_ in 2001 he became the Australian Ballet's artistic director shortly afterwards. During twenty years in this role, McAllister helped to transform the company into one of the best dance companies in the world. In his 2020 memoir _Soar: A Life Freed by Dance_ he writes that highlights of his tenure include choreographing a new production of _Sleeping Beauty_ (2015), commissioning new works, supporting local choreographers and introducing a maternity leave policy and a health and wellness team. Since retiring in 2020, he has choreographed a new _Swan Lake_ (2021) for the Finnish National Ballet."

Dad was an accountant, Mum was my mum and I have brothers and sisters that there's no artistic sort of dance background in our family at all. So, I was this sort of mutant child who, you know, used to dance around the house all the time and I used to dance in front of the TV when the TV was off so I could see myself, you know, moving around. And whenever there was a family gathering, I was always putting on a show and annoying the hell out of everyone. So, I guess it was in my DNA and I didn't really have a plan B. Iâ€™d started training when I was seven. I didn't realize that all the other boys at school wouldn't think it was quite as cool as what I did. So, that was, a life journey. But yeah, I just love to dance. And I guess ballet, because I saw some ballet on TV, which was Rudolf Nureyev doing Don Quixote with the Australian Ballet. And I went, Oh, that's the sort of dance I want to do. And then I went to a ballet school and 10 years later I was in Melbourne at the Australian Ballet School. And two years later I joined the company.\\n\\nI've got to say the first time I saw that portrait, I was just in awe really. I'd seen all of the preparatory work that Peter had done through his journals and diaries and things, and he talked a lot about it. So, I guess I knew that the dance element would be as it was, and it was incredibly beautiful. But I had no idea of what I'd look like. And it was really, really amazing. He caught a moment that sort of not, I guess what people would think necessarily is a former dancer and, a, you know, artistic director, because we tend to be on, you know, sort of like â€˜Welcome to the balletâ€™. And it was sort of more of a pensive moment. And I really liked that â€™cos, you know, I feel like it's the side of me that sometimes people don't get to see. And so it's beautiful that it's the side that he's shown.",

                "content": "Robert McFarlane (1942â€“2023), photographer, was born in Glenelg, South Australia. After leaving school he began work in a small advertising agency, where his growing interest in photography was encouraged. In 1963 he moved to Sydney, where he began freelancing for magazines including the _Bulletin_, _Vogue Australia_ and _Walkabout_. McFarlane's 1964 photograph of Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins on a Sydney bus is one of his most recognisable images. At the same time, as editor of the magazine _Camera World_, he began his lifelong career writing about photography. In the early 1970s he travelled and worked overseas. Since 1973 he has documented Australian society and key figures in politics and the performing arts, taking stills photographs on a great number of significant Australian films and theatre productions. He has exhibited in solo and group shows and has written regular photography criticism for the _Australian_ and the _Sydney Morning Herald_. His work is represented in the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of NSW and the National Library as well as the National Portrait Gallery."

In 1912 he travelled around Europe and the UK, and his landscapes were exhibited at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters in London in 1913. Back in Melbourne he held successful exhibitions and taught drawing at the National Gallery School from 1916 to 1934. Beginning in 1921, McInnes won the Archibald Prize seven times, writing in defence of his conservative work that 'in Australia we have not been bitten by Cubism or Futurism or other isms â€¦ and I am glad of it'. Sir William Dargie was the only artist to win more times than McInnes; Dargie employed a style similar to McInnes, of optical realism based on tonal values, which had been handed down from Bernard Hall, McInnes' teacher, via Max Meldrum to Archibald Colquhoun, Dargie's teacher. In 1927 McInnes was commissioned, with Septimus Power, to paint the opening of Federal Parliament by HRH the Duke of York. He went to London in 1933 to paint the Duke's portrait. The following year he acted as director of the National Gallery of Victoria, and became Head of the National Gallery School, a position he held until shortly before his death."

He grew up in Brisbane, where he studied architecture before switching to art school. In the late 1970s he moved to Sydney, living in share houses and using an office in an old Elizabeth Street building as a studio. As the garment trade evaporated in Surry Hills, he took studio space there. For much of the 1980s he worked by night at the Cosmopolitan CafÃ© and Twenty One in Double Bay. Horses have been central to his art from the beginning, inspired by trips to the races with his father. 'Being a painter is a bigger gamble than being a punter, in terms of getting a collect,' the artist once observed. His first solo exhibition was a show of etchings of horses, at the Garry Anderson gallery in Potts Point. In 1993 he began painting on ceramics in a commercial shopfront in Newtown, and the following year had a solo exhibition at Roslyn Oxley9 in Sydney â€“ an assortment of horses painted on plates, with dainty dotted borders. He won the Sulman Prize in 1994 and has taken out the Art Gallery of New South Wales Trustees' prize for watercolour five times. Both the Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art and the Art Gallery of New South Wales have shown major series by McKenna. Twenty of his works were shown in _The Popular Pet Show_ at the National Portrait Gallery in 2016."

A co-founder, in 1975, of the Photographers Gallery, McNicol held his first exhibition, with Carol Jerrems, in 1978 at Brummels Gallery â€“ the first Australian gallery dedicated to the work of photographers. Soon afterwards, he moved into studio space in Fitzroy, and between 1978 and 1986 created a series of black-and-white portraits of his friends and contemporaries â€“ 'artists, actors, drug addicts and other fellow marginals', as McNicol has said. This series was exhibited in Melbourne, Cracow and Paris in the 1980s. In 1989â€“1990, McNicol undertook an Australia Council-funded residency in the cancer ward of Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, during which time he created a series of portraits of terminally ill patients, exhibited as Art and the Cancer Ward in Melbourne in 1992. Deeply affected by this experience, McNicol shelved his photographic practice for several years during the 1990s. He completed a Master of Fine Arts at Monash University in 2007, his major project being to recreate the portraits from the 1978â€“1986 _Portrait of Melbourne_ series. McNicol's work has been included in many solo and group exhibitions including the Australian Photographic Portrait Prize (2004â€“2006); the Olive Cotton Portrait Prize (2005â€“2008); and the National Portrait Gallery exhibitions _Reveries: Photography and Mortality_ (2007) and _Life and Time: Portraits by Rod McNicol_ (2015). The winner of the 2004 Australian Photographic Portrait Prize, McNicol was a finalist in 2007 and 2010. He took out the National Photographic Portrait Prize in 2012 with his portrait of his friend, actor Jack Charles, who McNicol has been photographing since the 1970s. McNicol's work is represented in major collections including those of the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Monash Gallery of Art, and the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale, Paris."

After serving with the Australian Women's Land Army, formed during the Second World War to address labour shortages in the agricultural sector, she travelled overseas in the early 1950s, living and working in London for a number of years. She returned to Australia with her Swiss fiancÃ©, Phillipe Gabriel Menetrey, who she married in Rockdale, Sydney, in 1956. Largely self-taught as an artist, Menetrey became a member of the (selective) St George Art Society in the 1950s, and is thought to be the first woman accepted into its ranks.\\n\\nUnder her married name she entered the Archibald Prize in 1957 with the portrait of her colleague, photographer Noel Fraser Hickey; and in 1958 with a painting of Pat Woodley, model and former Miss New South Wales and Miss Australia. The painting of Hickey was among the 69 works selected for the 1957 Archibald exhibition. Menetrey left Australia again in 1958 and spent the next decade living in Canada and Switzerland. After returning to Sydney in 1969, she held the occasional solo exhibition and exhibited in a number of group shows, including the Portia Geach Memorial Award several times in the 1970s. She was president of the Kuring-Gai Art Society from 1979 to 1981. Among Menetrey's other portrait subjects were Rita Young (nÃ©e Lee), who modelled for artists such as Norman Lindsay, Rah Fizelle, Max Dupain and Kerry Dundas in the 1930s and 1940s; and author and conservationist Mary Edgeworth David, the daughter of the Antarctic explorer and eminent geologist Sir Tannatt William Edgeworth David. In the 1970s she painted a commissioned portrait of Admiral Sir Victor Smith (1913â€“1998), former Chief of Navy, which is on display at HMAS Albatross in Nowra."

According to the standard text on British silhouettes, Metford made 'some very fine family groups - Father and Mother surrounded by their children and pets, with hand-painted backgrounds of imposing rooms whose tall windows looked out on wide landscapes, or a seascape with a tall-funnelled steamship in a prominent position.' Metford moved to America in about 1834, and spent some ten years there, working mostly in Connecticut but also in New York and South Carolina. He returned to England in the early 1840s, and lived there for the rest of his life, although he revisited America in 1869 and 1867. He died at Weston-Super-Mare."

It was really the first time [that] time disappeared for me, you know; I was so excited about doing it.\\n\\nMost people, even people who are really well known and photographed all the time, feel a bit vulnerable. Itâ€™s incredibly easy to take a horrible picture of somebody where they look really tense and they donâ€™t look like themselves. So, I guess Iâ€™m interested in people being comfortable. And Iâ€™m interested in, not the eyes that are uncomfortable andâ€™ how Iâ€™m going to lookâ€™, Iâ€™m interested in the eyes that try to get some sort of straight gaze where at least you have the impression that youâ€™re contacting the essence of that person. I mean, there was a phrase that I quite used to like, which was Buddha Nature, which means, you know, like that in you which doesnâ€™t change. Obviously, it can be damaged, but you can take pictures of quite small children. And you know that thereâ€™s something in that photograph that if you came back 50 years later, there would be still the same thing in it. And thatâ€™s sort of, I guess, what Iâ€™m interested in, really.\\n\\nTaking photographs is a bit like a temporary infatuation for me. Because Iâ€™m not interested in taking awkward pictures of somebody. So itâ€™s a bit like, you know, that process when you fall in love with somebody, they do one thing, into that one thing you attach all these qualities which they donâ€™t have, they just do that one thing. But you donâ€™t want to show somehow â€¦ you donâ€™t want to see the bad things in that state. You just put all the good things together. Iâ€™ve taken photographs of people who have looked at them afterwards and Iâ€™ve thought, yes, the person whoâ€™s in love with him sees him like that.",

Born in Brisbane, she graduated from the Queensland College of Art in 1982. After moving to Sydney, Moffatt was one of the co-founders of the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative, and worked with Anthony (Ace) Bourke to curate NADOC '86 exhibition of Aboriginal and Islander photographers. In 1987 she made her first short film, _Nice Coloured Girls_. Moffatt became widely known through her celebrated first solo exhibition, _Something More_ (1989). In 1990 her short film _Night Cries â€“ A Rural Tragedy_ (1989) was selected for official competition at the Cannes Film Festival, as was her first feature-length film, _Bedevil_, in 1993. Following the photographic series _Scarred for Life_ (1994) she was invited to exhibit in the Venice Biennale in 1997, and during that year held solo exhibitions in Germany, Denmark, France and the USA. Since then, she has built an international reputation with a body of films and photographic series such as _Laudanum_ (1998), _Invocations_ (2000), _Under the Sign of Scorpio_ (2005), _First Jobs_ (2008) and _Spirit Landscapes_ (2013). In 2007 she received the Infinity Award from New York's International Center of Photography; in 2012 she had a solo show at the cityâ€™s Museum of Modern Art. She became the first Aboriginal artist to present a solo exhibition, _My Horizon_, at the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017. Moffatt's work is represented in all major Australian galleries."

After war service in New Guinea and Manila, he enrolled as an art student under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme at the Strathfield campus of East Sydney Technical College. He exhibited with the Strath Art Group between 1949 and 1954 (thereafter, he was part of no group). During this period, from 1949 to 1952, he travelled in Europe, where he was particularly influenced by the German and Norwegian expressionists. In 1955 he settled in Brisbane, where he began to paint passionately intense and personal works that are now in the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Queensland Art Gallery. As a teacher, he encouraged a number of innovative artists including Andrew Sibley and Merv Moriarty to pursue their own visions. In 1961 he won the inaugural Transfield prize, the countryâ€™s richest art award, and was able to purchase land near Brisbane on which he built a house. Through the 1960s he won a series of art prizes in Queensland, and exhibited with the Sydney dealer Rudy Komon. Molvigâ€™s work is notoriously variable in style; his many portraits illustrate his many different approaches to his art. From 1952 he entered the Archibald, but was not hung until 1955. In 1966, his portraits of Charles Blackman and Sir Charles Moses were both hung; he won the prize for the Blackman portrait, which is now in the Art Gallery of South Australia. From the late 1960s he was increasingly ill with chronic kidney disease; he died following the rejection of a kidney transplant in Brisbane. A retrospective of his work initiated by the Newcastle Region Art Gallery toured nationally in 1978. Molvig is represented in all major Australian galleries, with his striking portraits dispersed between them."

                "transcript": "I donâ€™t know whether youâ€™ve ever noticed it, but colour has a lot of psychological significance; some colours can make you happy and some sad, some heavy and some light. I try to use colours that heighten the feeling of what I want to say. For instance, if I was painting a young girl, I wouldnâ€™t use browns and purples and heavy colours like that; Iâ€™d naturally use something thatâ€™s light and youthful and airy, happy, perhaps, depending on whether I wanted to make her happy or sad. If I was painting an old man, I wouldnâ€™t use light greens and light blues, things like that. Thatâ€™s only a very rough basis for psychology of colour.\\n\\nQuite often I use drawings, particularly in portraits. When I have a portrait commission to do â€“ not a commission necessarily but a portrait â€“ I usually do a lot of drawings. I like to become familiar with the subject, especially the character of the subject and the general feeling of it. I usually throw the drawing away and do the painting from memory. But usually now, with an ordinary subject, I just start straight on the large canvas and work it out from there. Once a picture is started, it sort of paints itself. What I mean is: when you put a brushstroke down, it indicates the next brushstroke to put down and so on, itâ€™s like doing a jigsaw puzzle in which you put one piece in place and you have to find another piece to fit in with it.",

And he introduced me to the authorities that were handling the staging of the play. And I particularly wanted to show the Parthenon at the top of the hill, at the top of the Acropolis, behind the action that was going on, on the stage. But this meant getting the floodlights turned on, on the Parthenon at a particular time. Now, I thought this would be very, very difficult indeed, but as it turned out, the authorities were only too pleased to co-operate, and they said â€˜No, that would be no problemâ€™, and â€˜we can do it at a certain time and if youâ€™re in your position at a certain time, everythingâ€™ll be fineâ€™, and they gave me all sorts of help from a position point of view; and I could roam where I wanted to and photograph this play and the environment on this beautiful night in Athens. And I turned to my helper and I said, â€˜Well, you know, this sort of co-operation is more than I could ever expect, itâ€™s beautiful.â€™ I said, â€˜All we want now, just when weâ€™re taking these pictures, all we want now is for the full moon to rise through the Parthenonâ€™, joking, you see. And he said â€˜Well, Iâ€™ll see if I can arrange itâ€™, so I thought that was very funny. So there we were, taking these pictures, and the lights came on at the right time, and he tapped me on the shoulder and he pointed up and I looked up and there was the full moon, rising right through the Acropolis.\\n\\nI took some pictures at that point but that was not the one that was used â€“ but thatâ€™s often the way it goes.",

                "transcript": "In this book â€˜Australia and New Zealandâ€™ published by Life World Library, there are two colour pictures of Aboriginal children at Ernabella mission station. These children are of the Pitjantjatjara tribe and they have blond hair which tends to grow out in adolescence. And one afternoon we went out with about thirty of these children into the hills nearby, and as soon as we got there, the children virtually disappeared into the landscape, because theyâ€™re so sympathetic â€“ their forms and their colouring is so sympathetic to the rocks and the earth â€“ that you could hardly see the children in the landscape. The picture on page 114 tends to show this; the children are searching for rabbits and lizards and things in these marvellous rock forms.\\n\\nI found that these children [were] totally delightful, totally unsophisticated of course, genuine, happy, really beautiful kids. The light, of course, in this situation of photographing these children, was superb, it was bright low sun, and this accentuated this quality of fairness of hair that the children have, and the hair is very similar in colour and texture and the look of it in the picture, to the spinifex bushes which dot the landscape across the country there. But I find that whatever the light is, as a professional photographer you have to make it work for you one way or the other. There are certain things you would rather wait for and you have time to wait for, but very often the pressures are such that you just have to take it some way with what youâ€™re given, and make it work. And itâ€™s incredible how many times this can be done. I think that there was no problem in photographing these children â€“ the light was superb â€“ but to photograph them against the light so that the light is in fact coming through their hair, gives the hair more luminosity, more life, more movement.",

                "content": "Lewis Morley (1925â€“2013) established his reputation as one of the key British photographers of the 1960s and is known for his iconic image of a nude Christine Keeler straddling an Arne Jacobsen chair. He ran a highly successful studio above London's first satirical venue, the Establishment Club, where he formed important associations with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Barry Humphries and a range of as yet undiscovered young talents including Michael Caine who frequented the hip venue. Many of the faces he captured on film define the swinging sixties scene in London, including portraits of Charlotte Rampling, Vanessa Redgrave, Judy Dench, Jean Shrimpton and Peter O'Toole. He worked extensively for theatre and television, becoming sought after for his particular style of 'on location' and 'action' photography and portraiture. Migrating to Sydney in 1971, Morley found 'the sixties all over again'. Despite this, working in a new country in a new decade his work underwent a dramatic shift in approach to style and format. Shooting increasingly in colour for magazines such as _Dolly_, _POL_ and _Belle_, Morley's Australian work provides an evocative record of culture change through the 1970s and 1980s. Portraits from this era include images of Peter Carey, Brett Whiteley, Nicole Kidman, Marcia Hines, Sherbet and John Newcombe. The National Portrait Gallery held an exhibition of his work, _Myself and Eye_, in 2003; _Lewis Morley: 50 Years of Photography_ was staged at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2006."

Mort arrrived in New South Wales from England in 1838, and by 1843 had extablished the colony's main wool auction house, Mort Company. He soon took on export consignments, stock and station agencies, railway promotion, mining and sugar cultivation. Successful pastoral investments in the 1850s financed his development of a large model dairy farm at Bodalla, NSW, where he also tried to grow cotton and silk. While rebuilding a Darling Point mansion, he established a dry dock at Balmain in the mid 1850s, where he progressed from shipbuilding to locomotive production and general engineering. This business became Goldsbrough, Mort & Co. in 1888, some 10 years after Mort's death. In 1875 Mort established the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company, which capitalised on refrigeration experiments he had funded between 1866 and 1878. The first consignments of frozen meat were shipped from Australia in 1870, the year after Mort died. The Morts were married in Sydney in 1841 and travelled to England in 1857."

In October 1841, Theresa married merchant, shipbuilder and wool broker Thomas Sutcliffe Mort (1816-1878). Five years later, Mort purchased land at Darling Point where the family home, Greenoaks, was built. Theresa and Thomas had eight children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. Their eldest son, Laidley James Mort was born at Greenoaks in 1843 and was later educated at Eton. Theresa was a devoted wife and mother and was also an amateur artist, taking lessons from Conrad Martens (who painted Greenoaks) in 1846 and 1847. Thomas Sutcliffe Mort's biographer has described Mort as having an 'immense love' for his wife and family; he is said to have been devastated at Theresa's death, aged 49, in 1869."

He left Ellinthorp in 1838 and established himself in Launceston as an artist, his students having supplied a useful connection to the colonists most likely to commission portraits. In late 1840 he relocated to a farm near Little Swanport at his father-in-lawâ€™s instigation. But Mundyâ€™s attempt to make a living as a farmer failed, and by 1842 heâ€™d moved to Hobart, where he sought work as an artist with â€˜leisure for a few pupils who are desirous of instruction in painting, drawing or music.â€™ Mundy received favourable notice for his work and during the early 1840s completed a number of portrait commissions, but despite his â€˜excellent taste and professional abilityâ€™, his practice gradually declined and exacerbated his alcoholism and depression. He took an overdose of laudanum in a Hobart pub in March 1848, leaving Lavinia and five children to â€˜lament his untimely demiseâ€™."

                "content": "Arthur Murch, artist, is best-known as a painter in a colourful cubistic style, but he was occupied with sculpture throughout his career. Murch trained at Dattilo-Rubboâ€™s school between 1921 and 1925; meanwhile, in sculpture his most important teacher was Rayner Hoff. It was his sculpture that won him the 1925 Travelling Art Scholarship, which he spent most profitably in Italy. Later, his chief mentor was George Lambert, whom he assisted in Sydney from 1927 to 1930. At that time, Lambert was weakened by remnant malaria, and he greatly valued Murchâ€™s strength, calling him the â€˜pocket Herculesâ€™. They worked together on the figure for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in St Maryâ€™s Cathedral, and Murch completed the Henry Lawson Memorial after Lambert died in 1930. Other works Murch produced around the period of his association with Lambert include the memorial to Thorburn Brailsford Robertson in Adelaide University, and the Macarthur Onslow Memorial Light Horse Trophy. In 1933 he travelled with a scientific expedition to Hermannsburg, and he returned to the mission the following year. Many of his paintings reflect his interest in Indigenous culture and practises. In the late 1930s he was in the UK, and worked on the wool pavilion at the Glasgow Empire Exhibition. In 1941 he won the competition to execute the memorial relief in honour of Dame Nellie Melba in the Sydney Town Hall. During World War 2 he was an official war artist in the Northern Territory, working in Darwin and around the Adelaide River. Perhaps because his father was a carpenter-builder and he himself trained as an engineer, Murch sculpted in all imaginable media including fibreglass, rubber, pottery, stitched felt applique and cement - the latter when restoring Norman Lindsayâ€™s garden sculptures. He was a foundation member of the Australian Academy of Art; he won the Society of Artistsâ€™ Medal in 1935 and the Archibald Prize for 1949. The 1977 exhibition _Project 19: Arthur Murch_ at the Art Gallery of New South Wales was the first major survey of Murchâ€™s work by a public gallery. Now, the Art Gallery of New South Wales has many of his works; the Australian War Memorial has more than thirty of his paintings and drawings and he is represented in most Australian public galleries. The papers of Arthur Murch, collated by Ria Murch, are in the archive of the Art Gallery of New South Wales."

Having spent a good deal of his youth in New Guinea, where he learned to love simple shapes and materials, Murcutt only just scraped into a university architecture course at the University of New South Wales, graduating in 1961. As a student, he drew on principles he had learned while working for his father, who had a number of building businesses in Sydney after the war. Murcutt is unusual among Pritzker winners in that he works alone, mostly on residential homes; he has never made a skyscraper or a tourist attraction; and he uses mostly basic materials. By using shades, louvres, fully opening walls and carefully planned ventilation he enables his buildings to respond instantly to changing conditions and requirements. His overriding design philosophy is that dwellings should 'touch the earth lightly'. There are several books about his work, including _Leaves of Iron_ (1991) and _Touch This Earth Lightly_ (2000) by Philip Drew and _Glenn Murcutt: Buildings + Projects 1962â€“2003_ (2003) by FranÃ§oise Fromonot. Murcutt's Islamic Centre project, an unconventional mosque in suburban Melbourne, is at the heart of an intimate film about Murcutt by Catherine Hunter, _Glenn Murcutt: Spirit of Place_ (2016). He is a Professor at UNSW, and is the principle 'master' on the Architecture Foundation Australia annual International Architecture Master Classes."

                "content": "Graeme Murphy AO (b. 1950), choreographer and dancer, was co-artistic director of the Sydney Dance Company with his wife Janet Vernon AM for three decades. Born in Melbourne, Murphy grew up in Mole Creek, Tasmania, taking dance classes in Launceston. At age fourteen he was the youngest male dancer to be accepted into The Australian Ballet School in Melbourne; he commenced with The Australian Ballet three years later and choreographed his first ballet, _Ecco le Diavole_, in 1971. That year he received an Australia Council Grant to study overseas, studying with the Joffrey Ballet in New York, and dancing with the Royal Ballet in England and Les Ballets FÃ©lix Blaska in France. Back in Australia, he was appointed artistic director of the Sydney Dance Company (then known as The Dance Company NSW) in 1976, helping it to become one of Australia's most successful dance companies. His most popular piece is perhaps _Poppy_ (1978), a full-length ballet based on the life of Jean Cocteau, in which he danced the title role four years after announcing his retirement. In 2001 Murphy was presented with a Helpmann Award for _Body of Work: A Retrospective_; he won Australian Dance Awards for outstanding achievement in choreography for Tivoli in 2001 and Swan Lake in 2003. Named a Living National Treasure in 1999, Murphy retired from the Sydney Dance Company in 2007 after creating a repertoire of more than 50 works. Over the years he has also created productions for companies including Opera Australia, The Australian Ballet, Shanghai Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. His honours include the 2009 Best Choreography Green Room Award for _Firebird_ and the 2011 Fred & Adele Astaire Award for excellence in choreography for _Mao's Last Dancer_. He was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in June 2012 for his distinguished contribution to Australian dance. Murphy continues to direct and choreograph productions, including _Turandot_ (2019) and _The Merry Widow_ (2021) for Opera Australia."

Born in Queenscliff, she grew up in Melbourne, where she met store-owner Sidney Myer in 1916. Eighteen years her senior, he had arrived in Victoria as Simca Baevski in 1898. Changing his name to Myer, he opened a sophisticated American-style department store, the Myer Emporium, on Bourke Street in 1911. Merlyn began an arts degree at the University of Melbourne, but was distracted by love, and in 1920 she and Myer (a divorcÃ©) married in San Francisco. Throughout the 1920s they moved between California and Melbourne. In 1929, with two sons and two daughters, they set up house at Cranlana, Toorak. As the company continued to expand, Sidney made generous contributions to cultural and charitable causes, but in 1934 he died. Merlyn plunged herself into the Myer Emporium and charitable work, administering the Sidney Myer Charitable Trust, which financed the Sidney Myer Music Bowl among many other projects. Along with her many Myer-related activities, she was for more than four decades a board member of the Royal Melbourne Hospital, engaging closely with patients and staff as well as fundraising, often at Cranlana, and making big donations herself. For her work on behalf of the Red Cross during the war, she was appointed OBE. She raised large sums for cancer and heart disease research and was a member or patron of many community welfare organisations. In 1960 she was promoted to DBE for her philanthropy. She also remained passionate about the Myer retail business and took a practical interest in the welfare of the store's employees. Between 1919 and 1981 she went overseas 144 times, and from 1942 she often retreated to her sheep and cattle property Booroola, but she remained a byword in Melbourne for elegance and generosity."

He is recognised as the first person to link Aboriginal art and culture with European painting techniques. Born at Hermannsburg (Ntaria) near Alice Springs, Namatjira had been making art for much of his life before becoming interested in watercolour painting in the 1930s. Exhibiting from 1938 to acclaim and working prolifically, demand for his paintings increased during the 1940s. Though famous by the 1950s, First Nations people were not recognised in the Australian constitution at this time and faced widespread prejudice and inequality. Namatjira met Queen Elizabeth II in Canberra in 1954, and was the first Aboriginal person to receive citizenship in 1957, but restrictions on his family and his community remained engrained and complex, ultimately leading to his death in 1959. His distinctive style, though seemingly taking on the appearance of Western landscape traditions is rooted in deep ancestral connection and knowledge of the lands spanning his fatherâ€™s country around the MacDonnell Ranges and his motherâ€™s country in the region of Palm Valley in Central Australia. The Gamatj clan leader Yunupingu AM leader has explained that in his work Namatjira was 'demonstrating to the rest of the world the living title held by his people to the lands they had been on for thousands of years'."

Arriving in London in the early 1950s, she initially lived on a Chelsea houseboat. When her brother Richard Neville arrived in London, she introduced him to people who helped launch the English incarnation of his magazine _Oz_, the first issues of which were published from her Bayswater home. Following early encouragement by the Canadian author Elizabeth Smart, in 1966 she published her first novel, _Fall-Girl_, which drew on her tumultuous relationships with the poets Peter Porter and Robert Lowell. Moving to Paris in about 1967, she published six more novels, the last three of which, _Last Ferry To Manly_, _Swimming the Channel_ and _The Day We Cut the Lavender_, formed a loose trilogy exploring the experience of individuals torn between Europe and Australia. Through the 1980s and early 1990s she was a regular reviewer for the _Independent_, the _Times Literary Supplement_, the _Observer_, _London Magazine_ and the _Australian_. She also wrote _The Poet and the Goddess_, a play about Robert Graves and Laura Riding staged in 1995 at Oxford, the Cheltenham Festival and the Everyman Theatre, Hampstead. A warm friend and a generous critic, Neville was married three times, the last time to the geneticist Lewis Wolpert."

Jinx was nine when she asked Nolan if he would teach her to draw: believing that art couldn't be taught, Nolan apparently just gave her a pencil and some paper and said 'Now draw'. Despite this, her childhood travels in Central Australia with her family encouraged her love of art, and when she eventually went to art school, at age 30, Nolan told her that 'You either have it or you donâ€™t â€“ and you have it'. After the family's move to Europe in the early 1950s, Jinx spent several years at an English boarding school and later attended finishing schools in Paris and Lausanne. She was seventeen when they moved to the United States. She studied French and music at Bennington College, Vermont, and subsequently found work with the United Nations in New York. After moving to Boston in the early 1970s she started studying art at evening college but later went on to study full-time in printmaking and fine art. Following her mother's death in 1976, Jinx temporarily relocated to London and then returned to Australia to be with her stepfather. She returned to the USA following Nolan's death in 1992. Still based in Boston, Jinx continues to paint abstract landscapes, holding a solo exhibition in Sydney in 2017."

Born in Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island) in Queensland, she enlisted in the Australian Women's Army Service in 1942 before beginning her career in political activism. In the 1940s she was a member of the Communist Party of Australia, which opposed racial discrimination. She became Queensland State Secretary of the Federal Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advancement in 1961, and campaigned successfully for amendments to Sections 51(xxvi) and 127 of the Constitution in 1967. In the 1970s she chaired a number of bodies set up to promote Indigenous interests, including the Queensland Aboriginal Advancement League. Throughout her life, she aimed to promote cultural pride among Aboriginal people through her writing, which she described as 'sloganistic, civil rightish, plain and simple'. Her first book of poetry, _We are Going_, published in 1964, was the first poetry publication by an Aboriginal person. Noonuccal returned to Minjerribah in 1971 where she taught Aboriginal culture to thousands of school children, and published two children's books: _Stradbroke Dreamtime_ (1972) and _Father Sky and Mother Earth_ (1981). Having gained world acclaim for her writing and advocacy (for which she was also conferred with four honorary doctorates), she published her last collection of poems, _Kath Walker in China_, in 1988. That year, she reassumed her tribal name in protest at the Bicentennial celebrations, and returned the MBE she had been awarded in 1970."

There was a deputation from all over Australia of Aboriginal spokesmen and women and we did go in. Sir Robert Menzies had told the public and the politicians, the people of the House, that he would not have a referendum in his lifetime as prime minister. Heâ€™d been badly beaten on the referendum before where he had appealed to the people to outlaw Communism and when the people said â€˜No outlawing of the Communist Partyâ€™, Sir Robert Menzies refused then to have anything to do with referendums in his lifetime as prime minister.\\n\\nWe lobbied the House of Parliament and itâ€™s to their discredit, really, that when we asked them to bring out the laws concerning the Aboriginal people that there was no laws, no books on the Aboriginal people in their archives or libraries, and they had to quickly have them printed, so that the politicians could read what it was, for and against the Aborigines. There was one, however, on the national â€“ the Canberra law book saying that if Aboriginals go into Canberra, any Justice of the Peace could declare them illegal immigrants into Canberra and they could be chased out of Canberra. This still applied to us, incidentally, at this period of time. And we always made a joke of it when we went to Canberra, you know, â€˜If you get into trouble, you know the law on the book. If a JP says Get Out, make sure you get your blanket,â€™ because the law still said that before sending them out of Canberra, they must first issue them with one government blanket. So we were determined weâ€™d get our government blanket if ever they threw us out.  \\nWe told everyone this and we made it a laughingstock â€“ Canberra a laughingstock â€“ to such an extent that the first thing Sir Robert Menzies did was delete that off the Canberra constitution. So itâ€™s no longer there.",

Itâ€™s easy to put a mark on a ballot paper, and I must say this definitely, that there was a small minority group of sincere Australian people but I would say 75 [per cent] of those who voted Yes did it to clear their guilty conscience.\\n\\nIncidentally, itâ€™s interesting to understand why those terrible discriminative laws were put into the books. In the first place, our civic fathers, or the white manâ€™s civic fathers of long ago, during the â€˜soothing of the dying pillowâ€™ era, the politicians, or the statesmen of that time, were writing over to Queen Victoria saying, â€˜The Aborigine is dying out.â€™ And true, he was â€“ they were poisoning him with strychnine in the waterholes and they were shooting him, and they were doing all sorts of things. And the Aborigine dropped from 300,000 strong to 80,000 in a very short period of time. So it was quite natural for them to say the Aborigine was a dying race.\\n\\nNow it was during this period of time that the Constitution was being fixed, and as they thought we were a dying race, to save themselves a lot of bother they said, â€˜Well we will not count the Aborigines and we do not have to make laws for the Aborigines, because theyâ€™re going to die out anywayâ€™. And this is the reason today why Aboriginals have not had any education, any decent housing, any facilities that the white Australian enjoys today. Itâ€™s because of that stupid business of thinking the Aboriginals were going to die out.\\n\\nMind you, the Aboriginals are a determined lot, and theyâ€™re quite ungrateful. They didnâ€™t die, they lived on and are still living on; in spite of the many attempts to commit genocide and assassinate us all, we are still here. I think weâ€™ll last the white man out, truly.",

Never got any answers to any of that at all,â€™ she says. At 16 she got a job as a nanny. Encouraged to become a nurse, she applied for a traineeship and was â€“ eventually â€“ accepted, becoming the first Aboriginal woman to complete her nursing training at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. She worked there until the early 1960s, and also travelled to remote communities, learning about her heritage through â€˜just doing what I could to heal peopleâ€™. She joined the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1967 and by 1975 she had become its regional director in South Australia. In 1977 she was elected Foundation Chair of the National Aboriginal Conference, formed under prime minister Malcolm Fraser as a peak body to advise the Federal government on Indigenous affairs, and she chaired the Aboriginal Development Commission from 1989 to 1990. Named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1983, she was Australian of the Year in 1984, and in 1999 she was named a Companion of the Order of Australia. In 2005 she was invested by Pope John Paul II as a Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great. While Chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission between 1990 and 1996, she helped to draft the Mabo legislation. The holder of six honorary doctorates, she was the patron of the Lowitja Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research. In 2022, on her 90th birthday, the Lowitja Institute formed the Lowitja Oâ€™Donoghue Foundation to continue and preserve her legacy."

So, Iâ€™m not sure that he knew much about [the] Stolen Generation.

People who know me of course know that I do smile a lot.\\n\\nThe suit that I wore on the day, I think he was a bit surprised because it was really quite formal and itâ€™s a suit that I wear when I receive the many awards that Iâ€™ve received over the years. My family had no difficulty at all seeing me turn up in that same suit. And because it was a portrait, I thought, well, you know, Iâ€™m an Aboriginal woman and Iâ€™m going to wear the Aboriginal flag, and Iâ€™m going to wear everything red, black and yellow.\\n\\nIâ€™m much more proud of the fact that Iâ€™m a nurse and that I was able to use my nursing experience to actually travel to remote areas in my own, well in my own right, just doing what I could to heal people. I didnâ€™t know my people very well and so on, this is one way of getting to know them out on the APY lands. I have had a lot of senior jobs, met just so many people in high places, really. And I enjoyed seeing them but they werenâ€™t the most important things in my life. It was really about making a difference.",

She was well known in the Sydney post war art scene and her portrait was painted by Drysdale and Dobell â€“ Dobellâ€™s painting won the 1948 Archibald Prize. Olley held her first one-person show that year. It was a sellout, and she held at least one solo exhibition annually from then on. In 1991 she reprised her success of 43 years before, when a show of thirty-five of her intimate, brilliantly coloured interiors and still lifes sold out again. The Art Gallery of New South Wales held a major retrospective show of her long career in 1996/7. Olley remained one of Sydneyâ€™s best-known arts identities to her death, curating an exhibition with Barry Humphries called â€˜Favouritesâ€™ at the SH Ervin Gallery in 2002, continuing to paint, and posing for numerous portraits by younger artists she encouraged, including Nicholas Harding and Ben Quilty. In the 1980s she endowed the Margaret Hannah Olley Art Trust, of which several Australian galleries, including the National Portrait Gallery, have been beneficiaries. Quiltyâ€™s portrait of Olley won the Archibald Prize in 2011. Tweed River Art Gallery is home to the Margaret Olley Art Centre which includes a reproduction of Olleyâ€™s studio and living space."

In 1880, he arrived in Western Australia, then under the governorship of William Robinson, to become attorney general there. Suffering ill health almost from the day he arrived, he took his seat as chief justice in 1883. By 1884 he had severely antagonised the new governor, Broome. Tensions between them involving interpretation of Colonial Office instructions escalated until, in 1887, Broome interdicted Onslow from the exercise of his office. Onslow became a hero to anti-government factions, who burned Broome in effigy and were jubilant when the Colonial Office lifted Onslow's suspension. He returned to the bench in May 1888, but fell into another imbroglio when the proprietors of the West Australian and the Western Mail accused him of open prejudice against them. Broome held an inquiry in Executive Council, at which Onslow defended himself, but there was no outcome. After other avenues of inquiry were canvassed unsuccessfully, the matter was passed to the Legislative Council, which found that Onslow's occupancy of his present position was an impediment to 'peace and harmony' in the colony. Onslow took nearly a year's leave. However, he returned to the bench in 1891, welcomed by the reinstated Robinson and a conciliatory West Australian. Throughout his remaining years in office, he discharged his duties competently. Retiring in ill health in 1901, he returned to England for the last seven years of his life."

The youngest of twelve children, he grew up in the working-class Brisbane suburb of Mt Gravatt. He was a skilled rugby league player, chosen to play for the Queensland Zone side, but at the age of sixteen he chose instead to follow his brother to study at the National Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Association's Dance College in Sydney. Overcoming his initial rebellion at the discipline of dance, he quickly became 'pure spirit' in performance, equally breathtaking as an earth-bound or aerial dancer. With brothers Stephen, an artistic director, and David, a composer, he was a founder of the Bangarra Dance Theatre, and was its principal artist from 1991. Page occasionally took time to dance with other companies, including the Australian Dance Theatre in Adelaide and the Aboriginal and Islander Dance Theatre in Sydney. He was also a seasoned television and film performer, appearing in the feature film _Kick_, the contemporary opera _Black River_, ABC TV's _Poison_, Tracy Moffatt's film _Bedevil_ and Christine Anu's _Wanem Time_. He represented Australia at the 1997 Venice Biennale and appeared in the opening and closing ceremonies of the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000. The Bangarra production _Walkabout_ received typically ecstatic reviews from critics, with Page's solo singled out for special praise. He tragically passed away shortly after the close of the Sydney season of _Walkabout_ in July 2002, leaving his family, his three children, and Australian art, dance and Aboriginal communities mourning an irreplaceable loss."

Her first solo exhibition was in 1981, by which time she had exhibited in both the Archibald and Portia Geach competitions. She has won the Peopleâ€™s Choice Award of the Archibald three times, with portraits of Paul Lyneham (1992), Bill Leak (1995) and Patrick Dodson (1998), and she won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize in 1994 with a portrait of her father, veteran _Womenâ€™s Weekly_ illustrator John Mills. Palaitis had painted John Howard for the Archibald Prize competition of 1979, and otherwise knew the Howards slightly as their children had been at the same preschool. When she was chosen for the commission, the three met at Kirribilli House to discuss her conception of the work. As she took many informal snaps of them in different areas of the grounds, the interaction between the artist and her subjects became freer. Unlike many portraitists, Palaitis is happy to show her sitters the work as it evolves from photographs to watercolour studies to the final canvas, and the Howards viewed it several times over the course of the 650 hours it took her to paint in her studio. In response to media and public interest in the work, Palaitis maintained that â€˜foremost in my mind was to portray, in whatever way, a sense of relationship between the coupleâ€™, whom she found â€˜sincere and unpretentiousâ€™."

Travelling to Europe between 1898 and 1899, he continued his studies and returned to Australia via visits to Canada and the United States. In 1901 he returned to Europe, staying until 1910 under the sponsorship of Dame Nellie Melba, to whom he was related by marriage and who wished him to 'work and be a gentlemen without financial restraints'. During this time he became acquainted with Hugh Ramsay, with whom he shared a Paris studio, and who was to have an important influence on his work, particularly his self-portraiture. Patterson's widow recalled 'I don't need to say that my Husband looked on Ramsay as an exceptional artist - in fact, I know he felt he was the Australian artist whose work he most admired'. In 1915 Patterson travelled to Honolulu before migrating to the USA, where he taught and lectured at the University of Washington Art School from 1919 to 1947. He died in Seattle, having visited Australia for the last time in 1951."

Peck layers visual motifs that challenge dichotomies; addressing complex concepts of identity, culture, innocence, power; and the place of the individual within a pluralist society. Peck's hyper-real painting frequently intersects with street art aesthetics, post-apocalyptic imagery, nineteenth century photographic landscape and portraiture formats, and recently, patterning from luxury interior and textile designs.\\n\\nPeck won the National Gallery of Victoria's Trustees Award in 1998 and the Metro Art Award in 2005. A finalist in the 2010 Dobell Drawing Prize and the 2012 Archibald Prize, he was awarded a highly commended in the Doug Moran National Portrait prize the same year. In 2013 Peck won the People's Choice Nillumbik Art Prize, Melbourne and in 2014 he was a finalist for both the John Leslie Landscape Art Prize and the Tattersall's Landscape Art Prize. Peck is also a three-time Sulman prize finalist, in 2013, 2014 and in 2017 â€“ with the striking work _Therefore I am_.\\n\\nIn 2015 Peck exhibited _Recruit #6_ and _Recruit (Self Portrait in the image of my son)_, both created in 2012, in the National Portrait Galleryâ€™s exhibition _In the Flesh_. He has also worked on large scale public art and mural formats across Australia and internationally. Peckâ€™s work is held in collections throughout Australia, and in London, New York and Hong Kong."

                "content": "Christine Audrey Pecket (1908â€“1996), artist, was three years old when her family emigrated to Sydney from Yorkshire. Two years after arriving in Australia, Pecket contracted polio, which left her partially paralysed and reliant on crutches and leg braces for the rest of her life. Despite this and being from a large, working-class family with little interest in art, Pecket was determined to become an artist. 'Disabilities are supposed to take everything from life, to leave it hollow and empty,' she said in a 1937 interview, 'but they don't. They make you try all the harder. One makes up one's mind to succeed despite the odds, and one does.' From around 1934, and with financial assistance from the NSW Society for Crippled Children, Pecket studied full-time at East Sydney Technical College, undertaking courses in drawing, printmaking, painting and modelling. Her solo exhibition at the college in 1937 featured more than 60 works and included etchings, drawings, watercolours and mural designs along with oil paintings. Having completed her diploma, Pecket established a studio in Castlereagh Street, Sydney, where she initially painted and taught art. Subsequently, during the 1940s and early 1950s, she produced and sold a range of decorative ceramics under her own label, Christine Ware. In 1955, she bought a house in Cammeray, where she established a home studio and returned to painting and teaching. She published an autobiography, _Some facets of my life_, in 1976."

Sometimes I would, of course, sketch, mostly with pencil, and where portraits were concerned, directly on the canvas with paint. Later on, after coming back from England, I used to make more sketches but I did my painting, the actual portrait, directly from the sitter. In those days you could get a sitter to sit still but nowadays they donâ€™t sit still, they want everything done in a hurry so that the method has to change. It takes very much longer to paint a portrait than it used to, simply because you canâ€™t get your sitter.\\n\\nIn my _Portrait of Richard_, [a] schoolboy about 12 years of age, I remember that I painted him or drew him in, first of all, with terre verte and then painted directly in colour. It took me about three weeks. He came and stayed with me and so we worked every day.\\n\\nIn a portrait I try to get the character as well as the outside resemblance of the sitter, to get the feeling, because that would be your feeling of the sitter; it wouldnâ€™t be the sitterâ€™s feeling of you, fortunately. In this particular case I was very fortunate. Itâ€™s a portrait of my nephew and he was very co-operative indeed.",

Educated at the Charity School of the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich, he was apprenticed to a whaler before serving as a powdermonkey in the Battle of Minorca and, later, a lieutenant in the Siege of Havana. Over the ensuing years he lived in France, served in the Portuguese Navy in Brazil from 1775 to 1778, commanded the Europe in the Bay of Bengal and spent time in Cape Town before returning to France. According to a recent biography by Michael Pembroke, over this period he engaged in espionage for the British. Endorsed by Even Nepean, under-secretary of the Home Office, in October 1786 Phillip was appointed to establish a colony on the east coast of Australia (before the French did). It was largely down to his meticulous planning that the First Fleet â€“ comprising eleven ships, 1500 people and two yearsâ€™ worth of supplies â€“ arrived at Sydney Cove in January 1788 at all. However, in the four years of his governorship convicts and officers alike felt intensely isolated and uncertain, and experienced critical shortages of food. As an Enlightenment man, he persisted in his hopes for the colony, always envisaging more than a convict settlement, insisting on equal distribution of rations and generally emphasising the desirability of peaceful relationships with Sydneyâ€™s Indigenous people (â€˜Any man who takes the life of a Native, will be put on his trial as if he had killed one of the Garrison. This appears to me not only just, but good policyâ€™, he wrote.) He contributed to early plans for the layout of Sydney and initiated farming at Parramatta before leaving the colony because of illness. He returned to naval duties in the late 1790s, becoming a rear admiral of the Blue and inspector of the Sea Fencibles. By the time he died, to be buried in a small church in Bathampton, he was a full Admiral of the blue, the highest of the nine ranks of admiral."

I have always found the natives friendly, and still retain the opinion I first formed of those people, that they do not betray a confidence placed in them.\\n\\nIn December 1788, one of the natives was seized for the purpose of learning the language and reconciling them to us, as mentioned in my former letter to your lordship, none of the natives having for some months come near the settlement. The man who was taken for that purpose appeared to be about 24 years of age and in three months was so reconciled that he was freed from all restraint and lived with me perfectly satisfied with his situation.\\n\\nIn the beginning of the following April, numbers of the natives were found dead with the smallpox in different parts of the harbour. It is not possible to determine the number of natives who were carried off by this fatal disorder; it must be great. And judging from the information of the native now living with us, and who had recovered from the disorder before he was taken, one half of those who inhabit this part of the country died. And as the natives always retired from where the disorder appeared and which some must have carried with them, it must have been spread to a considerable distance, as well as inland as along the coast. We have seen traces of it wherever we have been.\\n\\nThat they have some idea of a future state appears from their belief in spirits and from saying that the bones of the dead are in the chase, but the body in the clouds.

American-born West, a noted portrait painter who succeeded Sir Joshua Reynolds as President of the Royal Academy in 1792, found Phillips employment on the windows of St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. On canvas, Phillips started out working in landscape and history painting, first exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1792. By 1796, he was primarily occupied with portraits and his reputation and demand as a portrait painter rivalled that of artists such as Thomas Lawrence and John Hoppner. He became a member of the Royal Academy in 1808, and in 1824, he succeeded Henry Fuseli as professor of painting at the Academy school. Among Phillips's portrait subjects are many eighteenth-century British luminaries, including William Blake, Sir Joseph Banks, Lord Byron, and Michael Faraday. His works are held in major public collections in Britain, Australia and the United States."

It means that you can be interested in people you are painting; doesnâ€™t necessarily follow that youâ€™re always interested in the particular job youâ€™re doing, although you make the best of it you can. Some sitters are more sympathetic than others and if you get no co-operation from a sitter it makes it very heavy going. However, you try to make the most of the composition and take some other interest in it.\\n\\nI think that my attitude to a portrait has to be reasonably objective, itâ€™s impossible to get rid of the artistâ€™s subjectivity altogether and necessarily one person sees another person in a slightly different light to what the next one would, and that does always condition your choice of position and your choice of light and your choice of angle and of expression that youâ€™ll put on a sitter. Nevertheless, I still, in a portrait, like to get more information about the sitter than I do about the artist who painted it. I think the work can be a work of art and yet be reasonably objective.\\n\\nBut Iâ€™ve had the experience that if I put what I thought was a reasonably amiable expression on a personâ€™s face and it seems to be an amiable person to me and the family accept that, to somebody else itâ€™s a supercilious smirk just because they donâ€™t like the person in any case, so that to the beholder all things are true.

British poet Stephen Spender described Porter's mind as 'immensely fertile, lively, informed, honest and penetrating'. Porter's first collection of poems, Once Bitten, Twice Bitten, was published in Britain in 1961. The death of his wife in 1974 gave rise to the poetry collection The Cost of Seriousness (1978). Porter's straddling of Australian and English culture remained central to his work, evoking urban and natural worlds. In 1990 Porter was awarded the Gold Medal of Australian Literature, and in 2002, the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry."

However, the thing which is most interesting to me about the process of writing is what particularly moves you to write on a, say, a theme or a particular purpose. Well, with me itâ€™s rather like something sticking into me, something will get into my mind, and since I observe this much of a method that I have a set of notebooks which I work in, Iâ€™m usually working in, say, four notebooks at once and approaching from one end and from the other end, moving towards the middle, so that I have sort of places where I am working, like a workshop, like a sculptor might have his workshop where he has still got a piece, say, unfinished which he is working on. I have poems which are in unfinished states, which I keep going back to, and every time I get an idea for a poem I just put it in a margin and return to it. The one thing I do believe in is often choosing deliberately a particular external form before you actually choose your poem, though over the years Iâ€™ve tended to write more free verse poems, but I still like returning to poems in set forms and recently Iâ€™ve been writing a whole batch of sonnets.\\n\\nI also try to use different forms and to attempt things which I havenâ€™t done before, but mostly itâ€™s ideas, I suppose. Iâ€™m probably an impure poet, I believe in impure poetry, Iâ€™m not interested in lyrical qualities for themselves. What interests me in poetry is the confrontation of certain sorts of language, and therefore I like to be able to use many different styles, many different ways of doing things. I neither like to be particularly modern nor particularly traditional. In my view, the best poets are those who, starting from a traditional basis, widen the language by their own imagination.",

After travel studies in Germany, France and Spain between 1904 and 1907 she returned to Adelaide to take on an increased teaching load. In 1912 she went to London, spending seven years there and in Europe before marrying and setting up house in the Sydney harbourside suburb of Mosman in 1920. Based there for the rest of her life, though travelling extensively, she campaigned vigorously on behalf of modern art while bringing forth a large body of robust paintings and prints. Preston was one of the first artists to recognise the significance and aesthetic power of Indigenous Australian art, the influence of which can be seen in some of her own work. She also saw the beauty in the native flowers and trees from which contemporaries such as Thea Proctor recoiled. Since the 1980s, many of her works have numbered amongst the most recognisable images of Australian art.

                "content": "Clifton Pugh AO was one of Australiaâ€™s best-known artists of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and one of its leading advocates for the arts. Born in Richmond, he grew up in Melbourne, moving to Adelaide as a teenager. There, while waiting to enlist, he attended evening classes at the South Australian School of Art. After serving with the AIF, and then for a year in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, he returned to Australia to pursue a career as an artist. Under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Scheme, he attended classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, training under Sir William Dargie. Although a favourite of Dargieâ€™s, soon after completing his course Pugh did away with tonalism, developing a style that is at once expressionistic and figurative, seeking to fuse successfully the rival approaches to painting the virtues of which the arts community debated so passionately in the 1950s. In 1959 he was one of seven artists who signed the Antipodean Manifesto. As Pughâ€™s popularity grew, so too did the demand for a portrait by him, which increased with his second and third Archibald victories in 1971 and 1972. Reluctant to accept commissions for portraits, he preferred to paint people with whom he had developed some degree of spiritual, intellectual or imaginative connection. These came to include some of Australiaâ€™s leading artists, philanthropists and academics. Pugh is now best remembered, however, for his portraits of politicians; his own deep interest in the arts and politics emerged publicly in his chairmanship of the Arts and Cultural Policy Committee of the Victorian Branch of the ALP from 1971. Once described as a court painter to the Australian Labor Party, he portrayed many of its key figures, including Gough Whitlam, Don Dunstan, Clyde Cameron, Clyde Holding, Lionel Murphy and Tom Uren. Yet, moved by various impulses, he also completed portraits of other politicians and statesmen, amongst them Harold Holt, John McEwen, Viscount de Lâ€™Isle, the Duke of Edinburgh and Sir John Kerr."

But always very upset because whenever they were aware of me, theyâ€™d gallop off, and I used to feel, if I could let them know that Iâ€™m not going to harm them. But perhaps because of other human beings they were scared. And my feeling the whole time was, if I could only get the birds and animals to realise that Iâ€™m not going to harm them.\\n\\nI saw one kangaroo had been shot and I was really upset about this and I used to go back and look at this â€“ remains. Then I got a shock the following spring, that the animal had practically disintegrated, but out of that area where this animal had died, there were these most beautiful orchids. And that gave me the realisation of this continuing cycle, is that this kangaroo had to die to produce something in the soil that produced these orchids, because they werenâ€™t anywhere else, they were just in this one spot. So all the paintings from then on, right up â€˜til halfway through â€™64, were of birds and animals, and this continuing cycle, always the paintings took the form, organic form of a movement, you could almost call it like a circle, â€˜til this trip came up to the north-west, up to the Kimberleys. There I had a very, very big change of feeling. As I said before, I felt myself not belonging to the world â€“ we were some mistake. Going up there, I felt myself starting to belong for the very first time, and itâ€™s made a big change to the paintings, because now Iâ€™m painting human beings, theyâ€™re in all the paintings Iâ€™m doing, because for the first time perhaps, at the age of 40, Iâ€™m feeling myself starting to belong in the world, that is, the world in its total stage, not just human beings and animals but all being one.",

He worked as a jackaroo for three years before undertaking art studies at the Grosvenor School in London. Back in Melbourne, he studied at the George Bell School where he met Maisie Mathews, who later became his wife. In 1938, Purves Smith left for Europe, where he painted major works including _Kangaroo Hunt_, acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, New York. He was an imaginative and inventive painter; the elongated figures and surrealist elements that Drysdale was to extend in representations of the Australian landscape were present in Purves Smith's paintings in the late 1930s and early 1940s. After proposing to Maisie, who had returned to Australia, Purves Smith joined the British Army in 1940 and served in West Africa and Burma until he was hospitalised with tuberculosis. He and Maisie married in 1946 in Melbourne, with Drysdale as best man; Purves Smith died following surgery to relieve his symptoms in 1949, at the age of 37."

He grew up in a mansion in what is now Essendon and studied at the NGV school from 1894 to 1899, when he was named runner-up for the National Gallery Travelling Scholarship. He sailed to Europe on the same ship as George Lambert. For fifteen months he painted and partied in a cold, grimy Paris studio, achieving some critical success while depending on the Lamberts for an occasional hot meal. In 1902 four of his paintings were chosen for exhibition at the New Salon, Paris; he wrote at the time 'it's rather an extraordinary thing . . . they seldom accept more than two, even from experienced and recognised men.' Ramsay's exhibited works brought him to the attention of Dame Nellie Melba, who subsequently became his patron in London. When he fell ill, she funded his return to Victoria, where Ramsay was to produce more than 20 full-length portraits before he died of consumption at the age of 28. His contemporaries admitted that he had the most brilliant potential of the artists of his generation. 'Had he lived longer', said Lambert, 'he would have beaten the lot of us."

She was accompanied by Mr Haddon Chambers, the playwright, and an Australian girl, Miss Johnstone. Madame Melba was great, and made me tell her all about myself, how many commissions Iâ€™d had over here and all that. She was intensely sympathetic, and I quite fell in love with her. I fancy she rather took to me, for some reason or another, as she seemed so interested, and told me she would be very angry with me if I didnâ€™t go and see her first thing when I get to London, and she promised quite voluntarily, of her own accord, to do everything she can to help me, which coming from such a person, is almost an assurance of success. With such a friend as Madame Melba, who knows everybody who is anything, well, it looks rosy for me, Auntie. My luckâ€™s in lately. My greatest fortune, next to having four pictures in the Salon, is to have been looked on favourable [sic] by Madame Melba.\\n\\nShe actually sat for half an hour for me, to do a sketch, but I was a bit flabbergasted and too nervous to do a chef dâ€™oeuvre. She has promised that she will pose for me in London. What an opportunity. Think of it. If I could make a successful portrait of her, Iâ€™m a made man.\\n\\nMadame Melbaâ€™s a charming lady, so natural, sincere and unaffected. Although sheâ€™s a great lady, you feel at home with her from the first, she doesnâ€™t put fears into your heart, as many in her position would, but makes you feel quite at your ease. I could tell you heaps of little incidents that happened during her one and a half hour stay at the studio, but wait till I see you, when perhaps Iâ€™ll have more to add.",

Her mother, a painter, woodcarver and accomplished musician, was a staunch supporter of women's rights and encouraged her daughter's interest in art. Rehfisch stated in 1965 that she began making art in earnest around the age of five in the wake of the death of her younger sister, her sole playmate. 'Life seemed so cruel without her, [so] I started to draw, pictures of God and heaven and angels and things â€¦ and the world to which I imagined she'd gone', Rehfisch said. Following the family's move to Mosman, she attended SCEGGS Redlands and after she finished school it was agreed that she should study art seriously. With her parents' full support, she studied under Julian Ashton at his Sydney art school for a time but left at the age of nineteen to marry Rodney Rehfisch, a warehouse manager. Their daughter was born in 1920. With her painting curtailed by wifehood and motherhood, it was several years before Rehfisch was able to resume her practice. When she did, she took classes with Antonio Dattilo-Rubbo at the Royal Art Society of New South Wales, where she met artist George Duncan. 'It was then that I really started to work', Rehfisch said, 'and from that day to now Iâ€™ve never ceased to work.' \\n\\nIn 1929, alongside her friend Dora Jarret, Rehfisch held her first exhibition at Farmer's Blaxland Gallery and she began exhibiting with the Society of Artists in 1931. By this time, she and her husband had separated and she was living in a studio apartment in Bridge Street in the city. Rah Fizelle, Dorrit Black, Thea Proctor and Adelaide Perry had digs in the same building. Heading to Europe in 1933, she studied at London's Grosvenor School of Modern Art under Iain MacNab, and became influenced by artists including Marc Chagall, El Greco, and Georges Braque â€“ the latter for what she called his 'feeling of design, his reality. Reality has always appealed to me. I've always hated frills and that sort of thing, in life and in painting too', she said. With Duncan, Elaine Haxton and sculptor Gerald Lewers, Rehfisch held a show at Cooling Galleries in London in 1934; and in 1938, she was one of the cash-strapped expats, including William Dobell, who contributed to the gigantic felt mural designed by Arthur Murch for the Australian Wool pavilion at the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow. During her time abroad, Rehfisch also exhibited with the Society of Women Artists, the British Empire Society, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, and at the SocietÃ© des Beaux Arts, Paris.\\n\\nFollowing the death of her estranged husband, and having travelled and painted in Spain, France and Germany, Rehfisch returned to Sydney in late 1938. She and Duncan married there in December 1942. Duncan worked as a camouflage artist during the war, and he and Rehfisch exhibited jointly at Macquarie Galleries, and in group shows with the Contemporary Group and the Contemporary Art Society. A fire in their studio in 1947 â€“ in which some 200 of Rehfischâ€™s paintings were destroyed â€“ prompted a move away from the city, and for the next several years they lived in the Southern Highlands. From 1939 until 1969, Rehfisch exhibited regularly in solo and group shows at Macquarie Galleries, the David Jones Art Gallery (of which Duncan was director from 1953 to 1964), the Blaxland Gallery and other venues in Sydney and interstate. She was known for her landscapes, still lifes and particularly her flowerpieces, often executed on hessian and always in a consistently post-impressionist style that employed rhythmic, structured composition, simple forms and a bold yet harmonious use of colour. As a result, Rehfisch was occasionally disparaged by critics who, in thrall to the vigorous, expressionist styles that came to prevail in the post-WW2 period, saw a lack of development or relevance in her work and that of some of her peers. 'These are contemporary painters in the sense that they are still living rather than in the sense that their work is executed in a contemporary idiom', James Gleeson wrote in 1951 of the Contemporary Group's annual exhibition. In 1950, Gleeson described Rehfisch's flowerpieces as being possessed of 'an ability to enthral us with a kind of magic nostalgia.' From the 1960s onwards, she and Duncan lived in Pymble, where Rehfisch painted and taught. Experiencing failing eyesight as well as bouts of severe depression following Duncan's death in 1974, Rehfisch took her own life in March 1975. Like many women artists of her generation, Rehfisch is now recognised as one of the foremost exponents of modernism in Australia, and her work has been included in landmark exhibitions such as Janine Burke's _Australian Women Artists: 100 Years 1840â€“1940_ (University of Melbourne, 1975) and _The National Women's Art Exhibition_, which consisted of more than 140 exhibitions presented simultaneously at galleries and museum around Australia in 1995. In 2002, the Beagle Press published the monograph _Alison Rehfisch: A life for art_, and the first ever retrospective of Rehfisch's work was presented at the National Trust SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney."

                "transcript": "When my daughter reached school age, a terrific longing to paint came over me, I just had to do something like that. I joined Dattilo Rubboâ€™s classes. It was then that I really did start to work. He was a wonderful teacher. He realised I was an unconventional, peculiar sort of person really, and he rather encouraged it, not always approving but always sympathetic and helpful. It was there that I met my present husband, who has always been a help to me, with his encouragement and criticism and so on, George Duncan.\\n\\nI worked seriously for years and years and from that day to now Iâ€™ve never ceased to paint.\\n\\nWithin the last few years, Iâ€™ve been extraordinarily interested in an ecological approach, which is the balance of life and place. I wanted to balance my subjects with something behind it, something deeper behind it. I think my early childhood feelings about trying to get behind things had something to do with it. Itâ€™s always been with me, always been interested in the other side of things. But somehow or other itâ€™s terribly difficult to get right behind things, as I think every artist should do. After all, itsâ€™ not just a superficial rendering of the things we see in front of us, itâ€™s trying to get the spirit behind all that and join it up with something, another life that isnâ€™t quite only of this world, and I expect I shall go along those lines for quite a while yet.\\n\\nUsually, when Iâ€™m painting anything at all, things come to me. Iâ€™m slightly psychic, and things come to me in that peculiar period just between waking and sleeping. I see the whole composition, the colour scheme, the feeling of the thing, but I have to work out the detail, of course, physically, myself, afterwards; but the whole general feeling of the thing usually comes to me, and I never start an important work unless that happens because I find itâ€™s never any use at all.",

His work is often deeply personal and explores his Aboriginal identity, combining the iconography of his Kamilaroi heritage with street art and graffiti styles. Largely self-taught, Rennie's practice is diverse, working across sculpture, painting, video work and installation. As a teenager in Melbourne Rennie explored graffiti through spray paint, which is a recurring medium and theme within his work. 'As an urban Indigenous Australian, my work often references the hip-hop and graffiti subcultures that were influential on my artistic practice in my formative years.' The spray can acts as a material and a message stick in Rennie's works, alongside the Aboriginal flag, crowns and diamonds he uses to question sovereignty and power in Australian post-colonial discourses of art. An activist, Rennie is outspoken around issues of education on First Nations' histories in Australia as well as the recognition and inclusion of First Nations' voices and self-determination in Australian political and cultural life."

Reynolds studied in London and Rome before establishing himself as an artist in London, where he was at the height of his fame by 1760. In 1764 he founded the Literary Club, with Joseph Banks, Dr Johnson, James Boswell, Adam Smith, actor David Garrick and playwrights Richard Sheridan and Oliver Goldsmith amongst the members. In 1768 he became the first President of the Royal Academy of Arts; he wrote a celebrated series of Discourses on Art to deliver to its members. Reynolds painted most of the stars of 18th century England. A few years after he painted Banks, he depicted Omai, exhibiting the work at the Royal Academy in the spring of 1776. Described by the National Portrait Gallery, London as 'an incredible socialite, social climber and self-promoter', Reynolds is buried in St Paul's Cathedral."

Born in Dubbo, Riley moved to Sydney in the late 1970s, setting aside his carpentry apprenticeship in 1982 and taking photography courses at Sydney University's Tin Sheds Gallery and the Sydney College of the Arts. Riley and his work became integral to the emerging movement of Indigenous artists working in photography and new media. He was one of the co-founders of the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative in 1987 and exhibited in the groundbreaking Indigenous art exhibitions _Koori Art '84_ at Artspace and _NADOC '86 Exhibition of Aboriginal and Islander Photographers_ at the Aboriginal Artists Gallery. He also worked at Film Australia, where he wrote and directed his first film _Boomalli: Five Artists_ (1988). His first solo exhibition, _Portraits by a Window_, was held at Hogarth Galleries in 1990. In 1991, he achieved international success with his photographs of his mother's Kamilaroi family in Moree, where he grew up. These were echoed in his 1999 series, which centred on his father's Wiradjuri family in Dubbo. His last photographic series, _Cloud_ (2000), was included in the Fourth Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art at the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane and the 2003 Festival of Sydney. His achievements were celebrated in the National Gallery of Australia's 2006 retrospective, _Michael Riley: Sights Unseen_, which toured around Australia. In 2014, the National Portrait Gallery displayed fifteen of Riley's black-and-white photographic portraits, made between 1984 and 1990, representing the vibrant urban-based Indigenous arts community in Sydney."

He arrived back in Melbourne in 1885 and established a successful portrait practice. At the same time, he began to paint outdoors with a number of other artists, including Charles Conder and Arthur Streeton, and they came to be known as the â€˜Heidelberg Schoolâ€™. In 1889 Roberts was an organiser of, and key participant in, the _9 by 5 Impression Exhibition_ in Melbourne. That year, intent on a series of paintings depicting quintessentially Australian scenes, he travelled from Melbourne to observe the action in the shearing shed on Brocklesby on the Murray near Corowa, New South Wales. There, over a few years he painted _Shearing the rams_ and _A break away_. In 1891 he moved to an artistsâ€™ camp at Sirius Cove near Mosman, Sydney; he was to live in the city for twelve years. In 1892 he exhibited some significant portraits. Amongst them were _Eileen_ and _Aboriginal head_ (Charlie Turner), the first two of his pictures to be purchased for the Art Gallery of New South Wales; and also the trio â€˜Church State and Lawâ€™, portraits of Cardinal Moran, Henry Parkes and Justice William Windeyer. (The location of the portrait of Cardinal Moran is one of Australian art's great mysteries.) Having completed his series of â€˜Australianâ€™ pictures with _The Golden Fleece_ and _Bailed Up_ by 1895, in the late 1890s he painted his series on wood panels of eminent Australians, amongst them many musicians and newspapermen; and also the remainder of his great portraits of women. Unsuccessful in his lobbying for the establishment of a national collection of portraits in the newly-federated Australia, he moved to England in 1903. In London, he completed his vast â€˜Big Pictureâ€™ of the opening of the Australian Parliament, but the project was exhausting, his eyesight dwindled, and he fell into a black period as the success he had hoped for in the old country eluded him. During the First World War he understated his age to work as an orderly at the Third London General Hospital, Wandsworth. He returned permanently to Australia in 1923, settling at Kallista in the Dandenongs. There, he mostly painted small landscapes and flower pieces."

                "content": "William Robinson AO (1936-2025) was one of Australia's most distinguished and influential contemporary painters, known for his distinctive and prolific output as landscape painter in particular. Born and raised in Brisbane, he trained as a teacher and studied art at the Central Technical College (now Queensland University of Technology) in the 1950s, after which he began a distinguished career as a tertiary art educator in Brisbane and Toowoomba (including at QUT). His painting practice continued alongside his teaching work, and he held his first solo exhibitions in Brisbane in the late 1960s. During the 1970s, following his move with his wife Shirley to a small farm outside Brisbane, he began creating works which were inspired by Bonnard and documented his surroundings, the interiors of his home and the day-to-day life of his growing family. When they moved to a bigger property at Beechmont in the Gold Coast hinterland, he began painting farmyard scenes â€“ witty, merry pictures in which cows, goats, chickens and other animals cavort across the picture plane, often with minimal acknowledgement of realism or perspective. He included self portraits and portraits of Shirley in many of these works. 'Every place that we've ever lived has really affected my work', Robinson has stated. 'My work is a total reflection of my life, and these places have sometimes been difficult but they have been of extreme importance because they have given me an individuality â€¦ rather than a recipe which must be followed, or fashion or anything like that. I abhor fashion: I could never become a fashion model and nor could I become a fashionable painter, because I just do what I am.' The move to Beechmont also initiated Robinson's engagement with the landscape, which he likewise began rendering in swirling, increasingly Romantic compositions that dispense with conventional viewpoints, incorporating multiple perspectives instead. Skies, rivers, rainforests and ranges contort and are upended; night and day, summer and winter coincide; trees grow sideways or upside-down; stars collide with the forest canopy and vice-versa. During the same period, Robinson entered the Archibald Prize for the first time with _William and Josephine_ (1984) â€“ a self-portrait with one of his favourite cows. Robinson won the Prize for the first time in 1987 with _Equestrian self portrait_; his second Archibald win came in 1995 with _Self portrait with stunned mullet_ â€“ his final Archibald entry.\\n\\nArt critic John McDonald has written that Robinson 'is the only non-Aboriginal artist since Fred Williams and John Olsen to give us an entirely new view of the Australian landscape.' Twice winner of the Wynne Prize (in 1990 and 1996), Robinson's name has become synonymous with swooping, grand and all-encompassing pictures of gnarled rainforests and deep green mountain ranges, dizzying views of the heavens, and paintings evoking the creation. His work is represented in in each of the major Australian public art museums as well as in prestigious international collections such as those of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the British Museum, London. In 2011, Robinson donated works valued at almost $5 million to the Queensland University of Technology in honour of his longstanding association with the institution as a student and educator. The gift included both of his Archibald-winning self portraits and now forms the basis of the William Robinson Gallery, situated on QUT's Gardens Point campus in Old Government House. Robinson held numerous solo exhibitions since the late 1960s and his work has been included in a similar number of prestigious group exhibitions. Robinson represented Australia at the Venice Biennale (in 1990), and the retrospectives of his work â€“ _William Robinson: the revelation of lands_cape (SH Ervin Gallery, Sydney, 2003) and _Darkness and Light: the art of William Robinson_ (QAG, 2001) have toured to venues across the country. Robinson's official honours included an AO, awarded in 2007, and three honorary doctorates."

                "content": "Robert Rooney (1937-2017), painter, conceptual artist and photographer, studied at Swinburne Technical college from 1954 to 1957. Between 1961 and 1966 he â€˜slowly and systematically eliminated the figureâ€™ from his paintings. In between his Slippery seal (1967) and Canine capers (1969) series, in which he used brightly coloured cut-outs on the back of Kelloggâ€™s boxes as stencils, he was represented in The Field. Soon after he made his Superknits series, hard-edged abstractions, â€˜absurdlyâ€™ based on knitting patterns. He studied at the Phillip Institute from 1972 to 1973; by 1978, his work was the subject of survey exhibitions at the NGV and the Art Gallery of New South Wales; with hindsight, it has become clear that although Rooneyâ€™s work â€˜employs the visual vocabulary of colour-field painting, it is in fact closer in intent to pop and conceptual artâ€™. From 1980 to 1982 he was art critic for the Age; for the next eighteen years he held the same position at the Australian. Rooney exhibited at Pinocotheca and then Tolarno Gallery between 1960 and 2006. The Monash Univeristy Museum of Art retrospective From the Homefront: Robert Rooney Works 1953-88, held in 1990, was accompanied by a catalogue essay by Philip Brophy. Since then, Rooneyâ€™s hand-painted acrylic pictures have been based on illustrations in little-known childrenâ€™s books or concerned with artworks made by children themselves, though he explains that it is not his aim to draw or paint like a child; rather, his interest is in â€˜modern Art (or Modernism) and childhood, or, if you like, the early childhood of Modernism.â€™ His recent exhibitions at Tolarno include Balletomania (2005) and Le Rire. In 2010-2011 the National Gallery of Victoria presented Endless Present: Robert Rooney and Conceptual Art, featuring Rooneyâ€™s photographs in the context of his comprehensive collection of Australian and international conceptual art, much of it gifted to the NGV."

Born in Sydney, Rowe was one of 23 students in the first intake of The Australian Ballet School in 1964. At that time, Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn were guesting with The Australian Ballet, which had formed in 1962. Dame Peggy van Praagh invited Rowe to join the company at the end of 1964 and she was promoted to principal artist in 1969. Four years later, she and Kelvin Coe won silver medals at the Second International Ballet Competition in Moscow. Rowe danced all of the major roles in The Australian Ballet's repertoire and had several works created for her by leading international choreographers, including _Gemini_ (Glen Tetley), _The Merry Widow_ (Ronald Hynd) and _Anna Karenina_ (AndrÃ© Prokovsky). She and Coe performed in New York and London, and became the first Australians to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi, Riga and Vilnius ballet companies. At the end of 1980, while pregnant, Rowe's husband Christopher Maver died in a plane crash. She went into seclusion, but when her son was six months old, in response to demands from the dancers, she returned to the company as an adviser to the artistic director. In 1982 and 1985 she received the Green Room Award for Best Female Dancer. Director of the Dancers' Company from 1984 to 1986, she was on the board of The Australian Ballet from 1994 to 2009, and was Director of The Australian Ballet School from 1999 to 2014. Rowe has produced and directed major contemporary and classical works and received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Australian Dance Awards in 2015."

She exhibited with the Society of Artists, the Contemporary Group and at the Macquarie Galleries; at the same time, she was a competitive horserider and keen surfer. In 1940, she first exercised what proved to be a formidable skill at fundraising by organising an exhibition in aid of the Journalists and Artists Ambulance Fund. The exhibition featured loaned works by British artists such as Augustus John and Duncan Grant, and locals such as William Dobell, and enabled the purchase of an ambulance for the army's Medical Services division. Roxburgh qualified as a nurse during the war; when it was over she went to London and studied at the Central School of Art. She worked in a number of jobs during her ten years abroad including dressmaking, nursing, creating costumes for the Old Vic Theatre and teaching art as therapy in hospitals. She also took up pottery, which she studied at the Hammersmith School of Arts and Crafts. After returning to Sydney she joined the Potters Society of New South Wales, exhibiting in its first group show at the Macquarie Galleries in 1958. The interior designer Marion Hall Best sold her pots, as did the David Jones Art Gallery. For many years she taught art and pottery at schools including Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School, Abbotsleigh and Ravenswood, and at East Sydney Technical College. From the 1960s onwards she was increasingly involved in built heritage conservation, serving on the council and the executive of the National Trust (NSW) and on its historical and architectural survey committee. Among her many contributions, she was integral to the fundraising for the restoration of Francis Greenway's St Matthewâ€™s Church in Windsor; and she published a number of books on colonial architectural treasures. A committed bushwalker, she held roles with the National Parks Association and the National Parks Advisory Council and campaigned for the preservation of wilderness now contained in the South-East Forests National Park."

Rubinstein left her home in KrakÃ³w, Poland at age 22 and moved to Australia. When local women in Coleraine, Victoria admired her skin, she is said to have set about importing pots of face cream made by a chemist in Poland, later described as 'the celebrated Russian skin specialist Dr Lykuski'. She opened her first beauty salon in Melbourne in 1902, with her signature CrÃ¨me Valaze, said to include rare herbs from the Carpathian Mountains, but probably comprising mostly lanolin sourced from local druggists Felton, Grimwade & Co. Her beauty cream was an overnight sensation. In late 1905 she established the Valaze Institute in Collins Street, offering various beauty treatments administered by her sisters and developing skincare and make-up. Having expanded to Sydney and Wellington, New Zealand, in 1908 Rubinstein departed with Â£100,000, to open modern salons in London and Paris. Fleeing wartime France, she opened in New York in 1916, becoming one of the first luxury beauty brands in the US; other stand-alone salons followed, and she established a presence in various department stores while retaining brand and marketing control. After the war, she returned to Paris, where she collected modern art, African and Oceanic sculpture and jewellery. In 1953 she established the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, which funded Tel Avivâ€™s Helena Rubinstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art, and also the Helena Rubinstein travelling art scholarship in Australia, which she last visited in 1957. The year before she died she published her memoir, _My Life for Beauty_. In 1973, the Helena Rubinstein brand was sold to Colgate-Palmolive, and is now owned by Lâ€™OrÃ©al."

After cursory art studies at East Sydney Technical College she attended Franklin School of Art, New York. Having returned to Sydney and married Jack Sages, between 1955 and 1984 she worked as a freelance illustrator and travel writer for books and fashion magazines including _Vogue Australia_. Following a trip to the Kimberley in 1983, Sages decided to become a full-time artist, concentrating on portraits, abstract and landscape works. A specialist in the medium of encaustic wax, delicately coloured with powdered pigments, since 1985 she has worked in a studio atop her home in Carlotta Road, Double Bay; she has had regular solo exhibitions since 1988. Her portrait of Emily Kngwarreye, the first work purchased for the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in 1998, was painted following her annual trips to Central Australia. From 2010 to 2013 an expanded iteration of the National Portrait Gallery exhibition _Jenny Sages: Paths to Portraiture_ toured to Tweed, Toowoomba, Mackay, Burnie and Mosman. Sages won the Portia Geach Award in 1992 and 1994 and the Wynne Prize in 2005, and has been a finalist for the Archibald Prize twenty times (1990, 1993â€“2009, 2011â€“2012); her 2000 and 2001 Archibald Prize entries were highly commended by the Trustees and the affecting self-portrait of the artist in widowhood, _After Jack_, was People's Choice in 2012. She last entered the Prize in 2013 with a portrait of Sarah Engledow, which was hung in the Salon des RefusÃ©s. The National Portrait Gallery has her portraits of Emily Kngwarreye, Helen Garner, Kate Grenville, Irina Baronova, and Nancy Borlase and Laurie Short. Her solo exhibition, _Lest I forget_, showed at her long-term gallery, King Street Gallery on William, in 2018."

With a background in advertising and journalism, he was the director of the Melbourne Festival from 1994 to 1996 and the Sydney Festival from 1997 to 2001. In the latter role, he was credited with making the annual showcase for music, dance, theatre, art exhibitions and outdoor events more diverse, accessible and financially viable. From 1996 to 2000 he was the energetic inaugural chairman of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and in 2001 he directed the Olympic Arts Festival. He has been a lively and powerful newspaper and television commentator on the performing arts, food, museums and heritage issues, and during his long tenancy at Sydney's historic Bronte House he painstakingly restored and maintained the house and its grounds. In 2001 Schofield gained an honorary doctorate for his cultural advocacy from the University of New South Wales."

                "content": "Ronald 'Bon' Scott (1946-1980) had come to Australia with his family in 1952, aged six, had lived in Melbourne and Fremantle, where he joined a pipe band; had dropped out of school at fifteen; and had spent some time in custody. By 1974, Scott was working at a fertiliser plant by day and writing songs that he would try out with other musicians at night. Artistic differences had arisen between AC/DC and their lead singer, Dave Evans, and Scott had had a terminal falling-out with his own loose group, the Mount Lofty rangers. He liked AC/DC but thought they were too young to rock; they thought he was too old to rock; but their first jam session was enough to seal the first AC/DC lineup. The following year, with two albums and four huge singles in Australia, the band was signed to an international deal, but American success did not come until Highway to Hell reached number 17 on the US charts in 1979. Two years later he was dead, having inhaled his own vomit while 'sleeping off' a bender in a parked car in London. His grave in Fremantle is the most-visited grave in Australia. In mid- 2004 UK magazine Classic Rock rated Scott as number one in a list of the 100 Greatest Frontmen. Significantly, however, largely thanks to Angus Young's star status, the band weathered the loss of Scott and his replacement by Brian Johnston. AC/DC's Back in Black, issued five months after Scott's death, is said to be the second-highest-selling album of all time worldwide, after Michael Jackson's Thriller; it is the fifth-highest selling album in the USA alone."

He returned to Australia in 1956 to take up a lectureship in English at the University of Western Australia and during this time developed an interest in environmentalism. He completed a BSc in Perth, with a major in geology, and then returned to the USA, attaining masters and doctoral degrees in science from the University of Minnesota. He briefly returned to WA before going back to America and taking up a professorship in geology and geophysics at the University of Oregon. In 1970, he published his first book, Swan River Landscapes. This was followed by many others including A Sense of Place (1972); Your vegetable garden in Australia (1983); A city and its setting (1986); and Searching for the Snowy: an environmental history (1994), which won the Eureka Prize. From 1971 to 1974, Seddon was chair of the History and Philosophy of Science program at the University of NSW. He then became the founding professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Melbourne; and was dean of the Faculty of Architecture and Planning there from 1982 until 1987. Seddon's other interests included tennis, gardening, botany, photography and languages. He was the recipient of many awards and in 1998 he was made a Member of the Order of Australia.

In 1994 he returned to Sydney, and began shooting for major publications including _Vogue_ and _Australian Style_. Retaining a distinct influence of his early years, during which he was surrounded by bush characters with large personalities, over the course of his career he has tried to craft a style of photography that is intrinsically Australian. He was instrumental in developing a distinctive photography style for the newly published _Who Weekly_, and was the first photographer to be commissioned to shoot in Australia for _Marie Claire_. His creative use of light came to be seen as a trademark feature of his work. His portraits have appeared on the covers of _NME_, _Q Magazine_ and German _Rolling Stone_ and continue to be published around the world. The National Portrait Gallery holds seventeen of his portraits, including photographs of Sir Donald Bradman, Shane Warne and Molly Meldrum."

Largely self-taught at first, he eventually studied at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, where he became strongly influenced by his teacher Shangyi, Chinaâ€™s most famous portraitist. Shen became a specialist in history paintings, many of which he produced for public collections. One picture, however â€“ a depiction of heroes of the Chinese nationalist movement â€“ necessitated his departure from China in 1989. His wife, artist Lan Wang, was pregnant when he left; it was two years before they were reunited in Sydney, where Shen met their daughter Xini for the first time. Having started out making sketches of passers-by at Darling Harbour, Shen is now a much sought-after portraitist, a regular Archibald finalist and has created work for clients such as the Vatican and Parliament House. He has painted commissions of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Tom Hughes KC and L Gordon Darling AC CMG for the National Portrait Gallery. 'There are two sides to my work,' he explains. 'When I came here I was nothing â€¦ so any commission was very exciting. But for a long time now, I've been interested in making paintings that show the big things: the world, history, great men.' To make a picture such as _The Third World_ 2002, depicting 92 identifiable contemporary and historical figures, he spends months in the library, as well as in his studio. He has no plans to return to China, commenting that â€˜When I go back I see the worst of communism and the worst of capitalism.' Shen and Wang both live and work in Bundeena, south of Sydney."

                "content": "Arnold Shore, a lifelong inhabitant of Melbourne, was apprenticed to a stained glass and leadlight company called Brooks, Robinson soon after leaving school at the age of twelve. He worked there for more than twenty years, and there, he met his lifelong friend, artist Jock Frater. For five years before World War 1 he trained at the NGV School under Frederick McCubbin, but left before completing his qualifications, transferring to the tuition of Max Meldrum until 1923. Meanwhile, he read up on modern European art when he got the chance. Over the 1930s he developed a reputation for flower studies before turning to the bush, which became a favourite subject. He exhibited with the Twenty Melbourne Paintersâ€™ Society, a breakaway group from the dominant Victorian Artistsâ€™ Society, from 1923 to 1946. In 1932, with the older and wealthier George Bell, an established art critic, he founded the Bell-Shore School. Bell had been classically trained; as Shore put it, â€˜Bellâ€™s training and experience was balanced by my enthusiasm and sense of art . . . He generally trusted to logic. I depended on feeling.â€™ The school quickly became an important influence on the development of Melbourne modernism but tensions developed between the founders and the partnership dissolved in 1936. In 1935 HV â€˜Docâ€™ Evatt and his wife Mary Alice gave Shore his first portrait commission (amongst the first works acquired for the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in 1998). The National Gallery of Victoria first purchased one of Shoreâ€™s works in 1937, and for some years he gave annual lectures there about modern art. From that time, his works were purchased by state galleries in Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney, and he also found himself increasingly teaching, lecturing, critical reviewing and judging art prizes. He won the Crouch prize in 1938. Shoreâ€™s career was at its high through much of the 1940s, when he lived at Mount Macedon and painted rich and distinctive views of the bush. By the spring of 1949 he had had six solo shows in Melbourne, the National Gallery of Victoria had five of his works and the Art Gallery of Western Australia had bought one of his paintings. In the 1950s, however, he painted very little. Throughout his life the artist endured periods of suicidal depression and anxiety, which were addressed with shock treatment and the prototype medications of the day. Shore was art critic for the _Argus_ and the _Age_. In 1957, Tam and Anne Purves held the first major retrospective of his works â€“ nearly a hundred of them - at their new Australian Galleries; both Alan McCullough and John Brack declared his significance. In 1960 and 1961 he was president of the Victorian Artistsâ€™ Society, which awarded him its medal of honour. In 1962 he was one of six Australian painters represented in a touring exhibition through Victoria, curated by James Mollison for the National Gallery of Victoria. However, by that time, the Angry Penguins were the fashionable artists of the day. Estranged from his wife and having to sell assets to afford a home, he plunged into melancholy that waxed and waned until he died of natural causes in the autumn of 1963. Shore is represented in all major Australian galleries. Much of this information is taken from _Arnold Shore: Pioneer Modernist_ by Rob Haysom."

I might be going to a shop to buy something to eat or to get a drink, or I might be going to meet somebody. But as a painter youâ€™re always looking at things, a big percentage of your time anyway, if not always, youâ€™re looking at things with a painterâ€™s eye. Youâ€™re noticing the colours and the shapes and the textures that you see about you. You also â€“ youâ€™re not lacking in humanity â€“ you also notice people, that people look sad or sick or happy and so on, when you see them. You see a drunk and you step out of his way if you think heâ€™s going to be pugnacious, and so on, or you laugh at him if heâ€™s just happy. But as a painter you look for these colours and these shapes, and youâ€™re thinking of your job. It might sound awful to talk about painting as a job, but it is a job just like anything else.\\n\\nAnd another thing, Iâ€™m breaking in on myself, but I believe that a cricketer or a footballer or a golf player, that they are when theyâ€™re at the best, that theyâ€™re in the same position as the artist; theyâ€™re using their knowledge and their skill and their feeling to do something. There is a difference: the golfer when he dies, heâ€™s dead except in the memory of people who remember that he won a certain competition or that he put up some record round, but he doesnâ€™t leave anything behind him except that. The artist if heâ€™s lucky, and the worldâ€™s lucky, does leave things behind him and thereâ€™s a peculiar quality about a work of art, is that once itâ€™s created by a man who combines knowledge and feeling â€“ it doesnâ€™t matter whether heâ€™s a primitive, a caveman, an Aboriginal artist in the bush, or a painter in a studio in one of the great cities of the world, a Rembrandt or a Velasquez â€“ once they create a work of art that really is a work of art, it never loses its quality. Art doesnâ€™t progress; it changes.\\n\\nÂ ",

                "content": "Ivy Shore (1915â€“1999), painter, was born in Melbourne, daughter of a South Australian suffragette, Elka, and engineer John Williams. After her father died in 1919, the family relocated to Adelaide. She trained as a seamstress before marrying a financier, Ray Shore, and moving to Sydney. Bored, she enrolled in painting classes with Graeme Inson, a disciple of Max Meldrum's. Separating from her husband in 1960, she bought a house in Ocean Street, Woollahra and in 1962, soon after Shore was widowed, Inson moved in. Through the 1960s Shore continued to develop her artistic skills under Inson, and he in turn eventually dubbed her 'my greatest student'. She first entered the Portia Geach competition in 1976; she won it in 1979 with a portrait of Della Elliott, now in the National Portrait Gallery collection. Inson was so irritated by the style of the portrait â€“ a departure from the Meldrum method â€“ that he went to live in his studio, but he returned home after a week. Shore used her prize money to have a studio built by architect Peter Moffitt above the garage of her house, and painted there out of sight of Inson. Over the coming years Shore continued to exhibit in the Portia Geach award, winning Most Highly Commended three times, and the Royal Easter Show Art Prize Exhibition. In 1993, she created her last painting _Influences_, a tribute to the five people who had most influenced her, depicting Henry Hanke, Robert Haines, Justin Oâ€™Brien and Lloyd Rees at a dinner table, Inson holding forth with a glass of wine in hand. This painting now hangs in The Dundee Arms Hotel in Sydney, where Inson once had a studio, alongside Inson's favourite of his own portraits of Shore. Her work is included in many galleries and private collections in Australia, UK and France."

He arrived in Australia from England in 1948 at fifteen, having studied at the Gravesend School of Art in Kent. Associated with artist Jon Molvig, he became a key member of the Brisbane School and held his first exhibition in 1960. In 1961, he exhibited at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. The following year his work was included in an exhibition at the Tate Gallery and he won the Transfield Art Prize, then Australia's richest art award. In the 1960s and 1970s his work was included in exhibitions in Japan, USA, Paris and Germany. Sibley moved to Melbourne in 1966 and was a lecturer in Fine Arts at RMIT until 1990, when he became Head of Painting at Monash University. Throughout his career he exhibited regularly and is represented in most major Australian galleries. His portraits of Molvig, Mirka Mora and Alan McCulloch were finalists in the Archibald Prize, and he was a finalist in the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize with his works of his wife Irene Sibley and Rodney Hall. Drawing was an essential part of Sibley's practice, and the National Portrait Gallery has eighteen of the artist's portraits in pencil and ink."

During the war, Smith worked in a camouflage unit with fellow artist William Dobell. In January 1944 Dobell's portrait of Smith was awarded the Archibald Prize for 1943. A law case ensued, with the artist complainants alleging that Dobell's work was a caricature of his friend. The court found that it was a good likeness. The trial was inevitably distracting, embarrassing and debilitating for Dobell and Smith, but the following year Smith rallied to win the Archibald himself, for a portrait of HS Rosevear. Dobell's portrait of Smith was badly damaged in a fire in 1958, but it has since been restored. Smith painted several memorable portraits, including one of Dame Mary Gilmore and a haunting study of his parents acquired by the Art Gallery of NSW in 1943. He was a regular exhibitor in the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes for many years."

If I remember correctly, I asked for about 15 sittings. Being the first official portrait that Iâ€™d been given from the Government I was rather a bit scared, you know. Anyway, Mr Rosevear was very co-operative, and it eventually won the Archibald, so, quite good!\\n\\nNow with my own procedure as regards portrait painting, that has varied considerably over the years. At one stage, I used to make a small drawing, say about 15 inches deep, in pencil, and more in the nature of a very accurate map, and then work from that; but later I found that I prefer to draw straight onto the canvas with charcoal, just dust that off and then paint direct. And I also like to have my sitter in front of me the whole time.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™ve been asked to say something about Chips Raffertyâ€™s portrait and how I did it. Well that was painted out in the open in the lawn in his backyard. I had a good many sittings. I remember Chips saying to me, â€˜Youâ€™ve worn a track across my lawn, running backwards and forwards!â€™. I like to have my canvas right alongside my subject and get back from it to make my observations as far as possible.\\n\\nNow Iâ€™ve been asked about any particular highlights in my life. Well, I think one of the most important things that I can remember is my first sale of a drawing. And it was a little drawing of my mother, a pencil drawing of my mother playing the piano. And we had it in the Julian Ashton School sketch club. And I was sitting next to the late Julian Ashton and Julian turned to me and said, â€˜Would you take half a guinea for it?â€™. I said â€˜Sold!â€™.",

After the war, he recommenced study at RMIT under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Training Scheme. Smith and his wife Joy moved to Sydney in 1952, and he found work as a window cleaner at David Jonesâ€™s. When he won his first Blake Prize for religious art in 1956, the _Sun_ reported that â€˜window cleaner Eric Smith took only an hour to paint the Scourged Christ.â€™ Characterised as a â€˜battlerâ€™, he initially painted in the bedroom he and Joy shared. In 1958 he, Joy and their children moved to Small St, Woollahra. Smith was to win the Blake prize five more times up to 1970. Notable for experimenting with diverse art styles, he also won the Wynne Prize twice, and the Sulman Prize in 1953, 1973 and 2003. In 1963, when he was in London to see his work hung in the Tate exhibition of Australian art, he received the Helena Rubinstein Art Award. \\n\\nEric Smith first entered the Archibald Prize with a strong self-portrait in 1944. He won the Prize in 1970, 1981 and 1982 with portraits of architect Neville Gruzman, art dealer Rudi Komon and composer Peter Sculthorpe respectively. The prize for the portrait of Komon survived a challenge from an artist whoâ€™d been stripped of the Archibald five years earlier for painting from a photograph. Smith acknowledged that he used photographs, but he also knew Komon, and had had multiple sittings with him. Smithâ€™s paintings are in the collections of the National Gallery, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Queensland Art Gallery. Working almost until his death, he was the subject of a television documentary, _Not Finished Yet_, in 2012."

This seems necessary for me, to just let the thing grow, to really try and find out about myself, let the thing happen, and as the forms appear on the canvas they suggest something to me, something perhaps to do with a subject matter, and if the forms seem dynamic enough, things are working and exciting level and I push that thing on to a particular subject matter.\\n\\nIt is so hard today, we have nothing to hang our hat onto, and itâ€™s a case of really digging down deep to find out about yourself. You take a risk here that you wonâ€™t be understood.\\n\\nI have always been concerned with the human condition, whether the tragedy or aspirations of man.

Arriving in London from Sweden in 1760, Solander became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1764 and began cataloguing plants at the British Museum. Not long after, he became known to Joseph Banks, and in 1768 he and Banks together applied to the King to obtain berths on James Cook's Endeavour. Having barely survived the dysentery that killed many of the Endeavour's crew, Solander returned to England to be fÃªted along with Banks for his scientific achievements. When Banks withdrew from Cook's second voyage, Solander followed suit; the pair went to Iceland and the Western Isles before Solander settled into the role of Banks's librarian and curator in London."

I have been well acquainted with him for many years and he proposed to me to go with him at his expense. I thought that such an offer and such an opportunity should not be turned down. We therefore made an application together to the King of England to obtain a passage on the ship, which was so well received by the government that the captain was ordered to give us the best cabins and to receive as well three draughtsmen and six hands who all belong to Herr Banks. The ship was called _Endeavour_, the captainâ€™s name is James Cook.\\n\\nOur intention is to sail around the southern point of the Magellanic land that is called Cape Horn and from there make our course through the South Seas to a big island that was discovered three years ago. It is inhabited by a very kind-hearted, civilized and well-shaped people. There we plan to perform our astronomic observations and maybe stay four to six months. If afterwards our ship and crew are in a good state, I believe we will try to see if there are no unknown countries left for us to discover. Our shipâ€™s name alludes to that Endeavour meaning Attempt. We will probably not return home before 1771. And if Mr Banks then is in the same spirit as now to follow up his studies of natural history we will probably directly undertake together a journey to Sweden.\\n\\nI hope when we return to Europe our ship will surely be the richest in Natural Curiosities, for Mr Banks spares himself no expense.",

                "content": "Lady Ellen Stirling (1807-1874) was the third daughter of James Mangles of Woodbridge in Surrey, a Director of the East India Company and later an MP. On her sixteenth birthday, Ellen married James Stirling, a naval officer twice her age. After the customary honeymoon tour of the Continent, the Stirlings settled at Woodbridge for around two years. Ellen bore the first of eleven children during this time, before James Stirling was recalled to active duty and given command of HMS Success. Stirling sailed for Sydney in early 1826, his arrival in the colony coinciding with renewed British suspicions about the intentions of the French regarding the west coast of Australia. Stirling eventually managed to convince the Colonial office of the political and commercial advantages of establishing a settlement on the Swan River and in 1828 he was appointed to the post of the new colony's Lieutenant Governor. With her husband and 3-year-old son, Ellen left England in February 1829, giving birth to her second son at sea en route to present-day Perth. The 'very affable and unaffected' Ellen Stirling was one of only a handful of 'ladies' in the new settlement, and like other governor's wives would have fulfilled the role of a hostess and focal point for colonial Society. Ellen has also been described as a courageous woman with a warm personality who took an active, if typically genteel, interest in the landscape and botany of the colony. Her 'dignified bearing', charm and youth are said to have endeared her to many in the settlement and softened some of the criticism of her husband and his governorship. Almost every year between 1831 and 1838, Ellen gave birth to more children - three daughters and three sons, one of whom died in infancy. James Stirling retired as Governor of Western Australia in 1838 and returned home with his family. The couple had three more daughters after returning to England; Ellen survived her husband by nine years."

The second box I also hope to ship but Mr Drummond who offered to fill it has been so dilatory that it has not yet made its appearance.\\n\\nIf my letter has reached you, you will know that Number One has been filled by Captain Meares. They all appear healthy plants. I sincerely hope the contents of both the boxes may arrive safely in England and that they may meet with your approbation. I should wish you to mention which of the two cases arrive in the best order and also which of the two contains the most valuable collection. Captain Meares will be much gratified to hear that his exertions have been successful, as he has been very kind in obtaining flowering shrubs. You will also receive by the _Hero_ the specimens collected and arranged by Miss Vittoria Meares and I think they are so well done that they will be valuable to you or at least to some of your friends.\\n\\nAny curious fruit trees would be an acceptable offering to Captain Meares in return for what he has done. But as he is not overburdened with riches and the large cases are rather expensive, you had better send his portion with mine or in case of our having left the colony, make some arrangement about the payment. He is very clever with everything connected with gardening. When you write to him do not allude to what I have said about expenses.\\n\\nThe box which Drummond undertook to fill has not yet arrived. It is not my fault if it is left behind for I have done all in my power to hurry the old man but he is rather obstinate and likes to have his own way. All the fruit trees that came out in the last box are dead but those that arrived in the _Shepherd_ are very flourishing. I am going to ride to Woodmanâ€™s Point in quest of shells. I walked there and back the other day, a distance of twelve miles without picking up one, but I hope I shall be more successful this morning.",

After a period of travel in France and further study at the AcadÃ©mie de la Grand ChaumiÃ¨re, he returned to Australia, enrolling at George Bellâ€™s school in Melbourne before moving to Sydney in 1941. He exhibited landscapes, figurative works and still lifes and became one of the group of artists who travelled regularly to the abandoned New South Wales mining town of Hill End. After World War II, during which he worked as a camouflage painter at Bankstown aerodrome and performed minor roles with HÃ©lÃ¨ne Kirsovaâ€™s ballet company, Strachan returned to Europe, living in Paris and then London and studying at the CJ Jung-Institut in Zurich in the late 1950s. Back in Sydney from 1960, he bought a Paddington terrace house, spurring his close friend, Margaret Olley, to purchase a house nearby; she often painted at his home, and used it as a studio after he died. During the 1960s Strachan taught at East Sydney Technical College and exhibited regularly, winning the Wynne Prize in 1961 and 1964. In the mid-1960s, too, he was the executor of the estate of Godfrey Miller and became president of the Society of Artists. In 1966 the National Gallery of Victoria held a survey exhibition, _Four Sydney Painters_, showing works by Strachan, Donald Friend, Justin Oâ€™Brien and Jeffrey Smart. In late 1970, just as he was beginning to feel â€˜contemporaryâ€™ and that his best work was still to come, Strachan died as the result of a car accident in Yass. Daniel Thomas curated the exhibition _David Strachan 1919-1970_ at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1973. Lou Klepacâ€™s _David Strachan_ with an introduction by Barry Pearce and an essay by John McDonald accompanied a touring exhibition of Strachanâ€™s work in 1993. The National Portrait Gallery acquired Strachanâ€™s portrait of Kenneth Rowell through the intervention of Margaret Olley in 2002. The Tweed Regional Art Gallery and Margaret Olley Studio mounted the exhibition _The mystery of things: Margaret Olley and David Strachan_ in 2016."

Becoming interested in women's issues in her twenties, in the interwar years she intervened in unemployment relief, the plight of Jewish refugees, and Indigenous rights. She stood unsuccessfully as a Labor Party candidate in the federal elections of 1939 and 1946; in between, in 1945, she was the sole Australian woman delegate to the founding of the United Nations, where she pressed for women's rights. Street first visited Russia in 1938, and was president of the Australian Russian Society from 1946; as the Cold War developed, she was (falsely) accused of communist sympathies. In 1949, expelled from the Labor party, she stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate. Street's husband, Sir Kenneth Street, was Chief Justice of NSW from 1950, and for much of the 1950s she worked for the World Peace Council in London. Her son, Laurence, became Chief Justice of New South Wales in 1974."

After all, the trade union movement is supposed to represent both the men and the women in jobs. There must be amongst their membership, the same number of intelligent women as there are intelligent men. And I would very much hope to see in the future â€“ I donâ€™t suppose itâ€™ll come in my lifetime â€“ that they have the proper distribution of places of influence between men and women both in the governing bodies of unions, and also, later on, when things gets more socialistic, in the governing body of the industries themselves.\\n\\nNow I say, â€˜get more socialisticâ€™, there because many years ago I became a socialist. I read quite a lot of books about politics and so on and so forth, and it seemed to me to be the system under which the individual, whether a man or a woman, had the greatest opportunity of developing their usefulness and status. You only have to look back in history in the days of serfdom and all the rest of it. Itâ€™s as theyâ€™ve gradually overcome the limitations that were placed on them by the social system, that not only women have advanced but society itself has advanced. And of course, if you come to think of it, men and women are both components of society and if you have a horse with a lame foot or a shackled foot itâ€™s not going to gallop was well as one that hasnâ€™t got, who hasnâ€™t got any shackles on. And itâ€™s the same with the human race â€“ if youâ€™re going to shackle the women, as they have been in the past and to a certain extent still are, youâ€™re going to hold up the progress of the whole of our society.",

In 1969 she was one of five women involved in founding the Women's Liberation Movement group in Adelaide. She then moved to Sydney and in 1973 was part of a cooperative that established Australiaâ€™s first refuge for victims of domestic violence, Elsie. For her doctorate at the University of Sydney, Summers wrote her first book, _Damned Whores and God's Police_ (1975), a landmark text in Australian feminism that has sold over 100,000 copies. As a journalist for _The National Times_ she investigated NSW prisons, which led to a royal commission and a Walkley Award for Summers in 1976. She then worked as a political correspondent for the _Australian Financial Review_. Appointed head of the Office for the Status of Women in 1983, Summers was instrumental in the passage of the Anti-Discrimination Act; in the 1990s she worked as an adviser to Prime Minister Paul Keating. In New York from 1986 to 1992, Summers was editor-in-chief of _Ms_ magazine; and later edited the _Good Weekend_. Deputy President of Sydney's Powerhouse Museum from 1999, she also chaired the board of Greenpeace International from 2000. Her autobiography, _Ducks on the Pond_, was published in 1999; and her book _The Lost Mother: A Story of Art and Love_ (2010) was shortlisted for the Victorian Premier's Literary Awards. In 2013 she published _The Misogyny Factor_, an analysis of the status of women in contemporary Australia. Her memoir _Unfettered and Alive_ was published in 2018.

Having begun an apprenticeship as a railway engineer, Sutherland studied at Goldsmith's School of Art for five years during the 1920s, concentrating on engraving and etching. He first exhibited drawings and engravings at the XXI Gallery, London, in 1925 and was a member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers from 1926 to 1933; during this period he taught, and illustrated books. In the 1930s he began painting surreal landscapes in oils and in 1936 was represented in the _International Surrealist Exhibition_ in London. During the Second World War he was an official war artist, often depicting scenes of bomb damage. He held his first New York exhibition at the Buchholz Gallery in 1946, and in the same year completed a representation of the crucifixion for St Matthew's Church, Northampton. In 1949, he painted a portrait of Somerset Maugham, which is credited with reviving English interest in portraiture and initiated a series including Lord Beaverbrook, Churchill and others. Between 1954 and 1957 he was commissioned to design the Coventry Cathedral tapestry, installed in 1962. He also designed posters, ceramics, book illustrations, and ballet costumes and dÃ©cor. Major retrospective exhibitions were held at the London Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1951, the Venice Biennale and the MusÃ©e National dâ€™Art Moderne, Paris in 1952, the Tate Gallery in 1953, and at the SÃ£o Paulo Bienal, Brazil in 1955."

Born in Darwin, she attended dance schools in Melbourne, Penang and Sydney before being accepted into the Australian Ballet School in 1973. After joining the Australian Ballet in 1975, she then worked as a soloist with Pina Bausch's dance theatre in Wuppertal, Germany between 1978 and 1984. As a freelance choreographer, she established her distinctive choreography in works such as _Two Feet_ (1988) and was commissioned for projects in France, the Netherlands and Germany. For three years from 1989 she was artistic director of Canberra's Meryl Tankard Company, followed by six years as artistic director of Adelaide's Australian Dance Theatre, later renamed the Meryl Tankard Australian Dance Theatre. Tankard's defining work in this period was _Furioso_, featuring aerial choreography. With composer Elena Kats Chernin, she created the full-length ballet _Wild Swans_ for the Australian Ballet in 2003. The _Oracle_ (2009), a revisioning of the _Rite of Spring_ for Australian dancer Paul White, won the Australian Dance Award for Outstanding Choreography in 2010 and toured internationally. Since graduating from the Australian Film, Television and Radio School in 2010, Tankard has made several films including the award-winning documentary _Michelle's Story_ (2015). She continues to create dance productions, including recreating _Two Feet_ for the 2019 Adelaide Festival and choreographing _Claudel_ for the Sydney Opera House in 2021."

She began training with the great Russian teacher Olga Preobrajenska, formerly of the Imperial Russian Ballet, at age ten after her family emigrated to Paris from Bessarabia, Romania. Noticed by choreographer George Balachine, at seventeen she joined the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. Tchinarova came to Australia on the first and second tours of the Russian ballets in 1936 and 1938, and chose to remain in Sydney after the second tour. In 1943 she married the actor Peter Finch, who had recently made his film debut in _Dad and Dave Come to Town_. During the 1940s she danced with three Australian dance companies, the Kirsova Ballet, the Polish-Australian Ballet and the Borovansky Ballet. In 1948, Finch and Tchinarova moved to London before divorcing in 1959. She then began working as a Russian/English interpreter for touring ballet companies, including the Australian Ballet, and as a dance writer. Tchinarova came back to Australia for the last time in 1994 as a guest of The Australian Ballet, delivering a series of lectures. Her autobiography, _Dancing into the Unknown: My Life in the Ballets Russes and Beyond_, was published in 2007. She died ten years later in Marbella, Spain at the age of 98."

                "content": "Violet Teague (1872â€“1951) was among Edwardian Australia's most fashionable and assured portraitists, although the art historical establishment was slow to acknowledge it. The daughter of a doctor, Teague was born in Melbourne and educated at home by a governess before completing her schooling at Presbyterian Ladies College, Burwood. In her twenties she undertook studies in art in Brussels and London, before returning to Melbourne and studying at the National Gallery School and the Melbourne School of Art. By the late 1890s, she'd already begun to secure portrait commissions â€“ her painting of former goldfields commissioner Robert Rede was awarded an honourable mention at the Paris Salon of 1898 â€“ and the portraits she exhibited in the Victorian Artists' Society exhibition in 1896 had attracted favourable attention. Her portrait of Una Falkiner won a bronze medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915; a portrait of family friend Theo Sharf was exhibited in the Paris Salon in 1920 (winning a silver medal) and in the Royal Academy exhibition in 1921. In addition, Teague was a pioneering Australian exponent of Japanese-style woodblock prints and gave lectures on the technique for the Victorian Arts and Crafts Society. Her work featured in the 1907 _Women's Work_ _Exhibition_ and in the _British Empire Exhibition_ of 1924â€“1925. In 1932 she travelled in Central Australia, and was so shocked by the conditions in which Aboriginal people lived that she organised an exhibition in Melbourne that raised thousands of pounds to pay for a permanent water supply for the Hermannsburg community. During the First World War, she initiated a series of tableaux vivants of scenes from Australian and British history, which were presented to raise funds for civilian charities. Several of Teague's best paintings deftly combine tradition and modernity, portraying sophisticated, educated and independent women in settings and poses which ostensibly conformed to notions of 'appropriate' behaviour and femininity. Examples of Teague's work are held by the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. In 2000, the Ian Potter Museum of Art mounted the touring exhibition _The Art of Violet Teague_."

His father was a Yuin man and his mother was of Chinese descent. Aged nine, he accompanied his father and other Elders on a 350-km walk from Mallacoota to the Hawkesbury River, learning about the sacred sites for which he was later responsible; he re-enacted the walk when he was 80 with a group of disadvantaged Aboriginal children. During the 1930s he toured New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland with the Wallaga Lake Gumleaf Band, performing at the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. After working as a commercial fisherman for many years, he became active in the land rights movement in the 1970s, working with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (now AIATSIS) to document significant sites on the New South Wales south coast. After a five-year campaign by Thomas, the title deeds to Wallaga Lake were handed over to the Yuin people in 1983. At the same time, he campaigned against logging on Mumbulla Mountain and for recognition of its cultural significance; then NSW Premier Neville Wran ordered logging to cease and it was gazetted as an Aboriginal Place in 1984. In the 1980s and 1990s Thomas met spiritual leaders such as the Dalai Lama, and held Dreaming camps around Australia and internationally to pass on his knowledge. Through his books and stories, Thomas strove to educate people to respect the earth, appreciate Aboriginal culture and live in harmony. Just before his death at the age of 93 he continued to protest against developments threatening Aboriginal sites near Wollongong."

His expressionistic style of painting was formed during the wartime years, when the city of Melbourne took on a strange and unreal atmosphere. His first major series of paintings, collectively titled Images of Modern Evil, was painted between 1945 and 1947. Tucker lived in Europe and the United States throughout the 1950s. There he refined and extended his subjects, concentrating on Australian myths, which he saw as central to the definition of national identity. Although best known as a painter, Tucker was an enthusiastic photographer. He took many of the now-familiar photographs of Melbourne's artistic circles of the 1940s."

And I suppose it relates to oneâ€™s attitude to life. I think that, despite all the negative and destructive powers that are constantly at work with us, that one is constantly striving to affirm life, to be in love with it, and these are the tokens of affection on our way, as it were.\\n\\nThe question of why I paint the particular things I do is also pretty ambiguous. I think I would say that Iâ€™m trying to exorcise my own particular devils, and I suppose some of them get into the painting. I hope they do, thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m trying to put them, and get rid of them.\\n\\nBut once out, of course, one can then feel this kind of relaxation, the affirmation flows in, and the devils in the painting can sometimes turn into angels.\\n\\nI suppose in the act of work that it is essentially a struggle to escape the enmeshment of oneâ€™s ego, and in the attempt to struggle free one seems externally, to the external world, to be a very egocentric person, because youâ€™re following a necessary compulsion without which one loses oneâ€™s own balance and direction in life; and in the act of working one is defining these shapes, ejecting them as it were, and getting rid of them; and this process of ejectment is one there which is defining and clarifying oneâ€™s own particular kind of energy which you are attempting to flow out into life.",

After the war he returned to Sydney to pursue his vision of establishing successful commercial airlines, and proved a capable and energetic administrator. When he co-piloted the Southern Cross from California to Brisbane, he had not yet obtained a pilot's licence. However, he went on to make several more record-breaking flights, both with Kingsford Smith in Southern Cross, and in command of his own aircraft, Faith in Australia. Ulm's Airspeed Envoy Stella Australis went down in the sea between California and Hawaii. His body was never found."

Valadon studied the Meldrum style of tonal painting in the early 1970s and after travelling abroad returned to Sydney, where she completed a postgraduate diploma in art. Her interests at this time included philosophy, feminist discourse, art theory, spirituality and mythology. Between 1990 and 1996 she completed _The Goddess Series_, a major series of portraits of Australian women as mythological/archetypal figures, including Germaine Greer, Ruth Cracknell, Blanche d'Alpuget and Noni Hazlehurst. This was followed by paintings with themes including fairytales, wicked women and the four seasons. Valadon is a regular finalist in the Archibald, Sulman, Blake, Portia Geach and Mosman prizes, and in 1991 she won both the Portia Geach Prize and the Blake Prize for Religious Art."

In the early years they often danced together; later, she danced with the company throughout the world, in roles and productions they had created together. In 1996 she was named amongst Australiaâ€™s top five female dancers of all time (along with Marillyn Jones, Marilyn Rowe, Kathleen Gorham and Lucette Aldous). In 2000 Murphy and Vernon celebrated their achievements in Body of Work: A retrospective. Two years later they put together a unique Swan Lake. They married in 2004, and in 2009 choreographed the film Maoâ€™s Last Dancer. Vernon and Murphy retired from the Sydney Dance Company in 2007 but the couple has continued to create works for Chinese, German and Australian companies."

She grew up in Western Australia, where in 1905, aged eighteen, she married 58-year-old John Winthrop Hackett, newspaper proprietor and politician. Together they had five children. During the First World War she raised funds for the war effort and wrote _The Australian Household Guide_, the profits from which went to various charities. Widowed in 1916, she moved to Adelaide and married Frank Moulden, who was made Mayor of Adelaide a few years later. As Lady Mayoress from 1920 to 1922, she raised Â£100,000 for Adelaide's charities and presided over the local branch of the National Council of Women. Over the course of the 1920s Lady Moulden became interested in tantalite, a scarce mineral. Intrepidly visiting potential sites in in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, she became convinced of its viability as an export, and travelled to the USA to secure a contract to supply ore. She incorporated Tantalite Ltd while living in London in 1932, and returned to Australia to form a syndicate to mine wolfram in Central Australia. During the Second World War her tantalite was used to make radar equipment. After Frank died in 1932 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Western Australia. Four years later she married barrister Basil Buller Murphy; henceforth known as Dr Buller Murphy, she lived in Toorak, raising funds for the women's auxiliaries of various hospitals and serving on diverse welfare committees. They moved to an orchard property named 'Lordello' at Kilsyth in the Dandenong Ranges after the war. Her third husband wrote a book about her interests in tantalite called _A Lady of Rare Metal_ (1949). In 1958 she published a book of stories of the Dordenup Aboriginal people who she had known when young. She died at home in Kilsyth and was buried alongside her parents in Perth."

No effort has been spared to make the work the most generally useful publication on the subject of domestic economy which has emanated from the Australian press.\\n\\nThe series of articles which it contains embraces such various subjects as: _Foods; their Functions and Values, The Australian Baby, The Kindergarten, What Young People Should Know, General Hygiene, Home Nursing, Hints upon Personal Appearance, The Home Garden, Poultry Keeping, Domestic Animals and The Typhoid or House Fly_ and _Insect Pests_.\\n\\nEach of these articles has been written by an expert, who speaks with authority upon the subject treated of. The recipes, some 3,500 in number and dealing with every branch of the culinary art and every department of household management have not been collected or collated haphazard [sic] but carefully selected by competent advisers, the great majority being actually contributed and vouched for by the correspondents, whose reliability and knowledge every reasonable care has been taken to ascertain and determine.\\n\\nSince the entire net proceeds of _The Australian Household Guide_ are to be devoted to charities it is hoped that its reception in Australian homes and its appreciation by Australian mothers will warrant the early publication of a second edition.",

Vickery was an important painter in Australia's engagement with the Op Art movement.\\n\\nA student at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, the artist had good success as a portrait artist early in his career. A finalist in the Archibald Prize three times: in 1932 with a portrait of Miss Leila Pirani, and twice in 1933 with his self portrait, and a portrait of Miss Joan Burbury. After a brief stay in London, he moved to the United States of America in the 1930s, where he pursued his arts practice while working in advertising in New York, as an illustrator. From 1943 through to the end of the Second World War, he sketched the portraits of more than 650 patients in military hospitals in the US and the South West Pacific, as part of the USO. Vickery's contribution continued after the end of the war, as Chairman of group counselling for The Society of Illustrators Veterans' Program, supporting upskilling, education, and reengagement.\\n\\nBy the 1950s, Vickery had become friends with Philip Guston and come into contact with other members of the expressionist New York School, including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Yves Kline. Despite his proven capacity as a fine portrait artist, Vickery primarily worked in Op Art, and named the New York School as a significant influence. He exhibited regularly in the US over the course of his career, and three decades after his death, his contribution was recognised at his alma mater: an exhibition of his work was the inaugural show at the Victorian College of the Arts' Founders Gallery in 2013. Vickery's work is represented in the collections of the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia, Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TÄmaki. The University of Melbourne offers the John Vickery Scholarship for Art students enrolled in Painting or Drawing, based on financial need and academic achievement."

He was soon in demand as a portrait painter, many of his subjects coming from high-ranking sections of the military and society, including royalty. Between 1935 and 1955, he created portraits of sitters such as King George V; Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother; and Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery. He also exhibited regularly throughout this period, often with large scale genre paintings dealing with subjects such as mythology, war and historical scenes. His obituary in The Times recalled him as â€˜a very gentle man, and immaculately turned out, choosing always to paint, no matter what the subject, in one of the same Savile Row tailored suits that he might wear to one of his exhibition openingsâ€™."

In 1963 he was won the Australian Commercial and Industrial Artists' Association's Award of Distinctive Merit, and thirty years later he was inducted into the Illustrators' Hall of Fame. In the 1970s Walters moved away from full time advertising work to concentrate on painting, holding solo shows of landscapes and photorealist nudes. Gradually he developed a specialisation in portraiture, undertaking many commissions. When he won the Archibald Prize in 1979 for a portrait of Phillip Adams - pipping Keith Looby's portrait of Padraic McGuinness - Adams predicted correctly that the 'arties' would be furious because of Walters's background in commercial art. Walters has stated that 'My main objective as a portrait painter is to paint as well as my hero, Velasquez, in my estimation by far the world's greatest portraitist. I feel this is unlikely to be brought to fruition, although sometimes there are instances when I feel I get a little closer.' The National Portrait Gallery acquired his painting of Sir Zelman Cowen PC AK GCMG GCVO QC DCL by gift of Joseph Brown and Marc Besen AO in 2000. In 2006, also by gift from Joseph Brown, the Gallery acquired Waltersâ€™s undated portrait of Arthur Boyd."

When he retired from Test cricket in 2007, he'd taken 708 wickets since playing his first match for Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1992. A specialist leg-spin bowler, he also made remarkable contributions as a slips fielder, lower order batsman and leader, securing him as one of the nationâ€™s sporting greats. After some inauspicious early Test performances, he took seven for 52 in the second innings of the Boxing Day Test in 1992; he was the leading wicket taker for the 1993 Ashes series, during which he bowled out English batsman Mike Gatting with what was dubbed the 'ball of the century'. In 2000 he surpassed Dennis Lillee to become Australia's leading wicket taker, and during the 2005 Ashes series he became the first player ever to take 600 Test wickets. Warne weathered the fallout from various off-field transgressions to be honoured with a portrait in the Long Room at Lord's Cricket Ground, the only cricketer to have been recognised in this way while still playing. An inductee to the Sport Australia Hall of Fame and the International Cricket Council Hall of Fame, he was Wisden's Leading Cricketer in the World for 1993, 1997 and 2004. Outside of cricket, Warne was a significant contributor to causes including Christchurch Earthquake Relief and fundraising for communities impacted by the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires. He was named an Officer of the Order of Australia three months after his sudden death at the age of 52."

(c. 1752-1793), the son of a Swiss sculptor, living in London, submitted his work to the Royal Academy Schools, one of the first to admire his paintings was Dr Daniel Solander, the Swedish naturalist who had accompanied Cook and Banks on the first voyage. Knowing that no artist had yet been selected for Cook's voyage, Solander recommended Webber to the Admiralty and Royal Society. His appointment was made just days before the departure. Webber was lucky enough to escape the massacre in Hawaii, where Cook met his death, and returned to London in October 1780. On his return he was employed by the Admiralty to make finished drawings and engravings to illustrate the official journey of the trip. He completed a series of paintings for the Admiralty, was elected a member of the Royal Academy and continued to paint landscapes in England and abroad until his death in 1793. HIs posthumous portrait of Captain James Cook, painted in 1782, shows not only the hand of a fine artist, but also a sensitivity and understanding of the sitter - a man Webber had known well and greatly admired."

In the late 1760s he brought forth his best-known work, the Death of General Wolfe, which became the model for various other death scenes of national heroes, including, to a degree, that of Captain Cook. West preferred producing history paintings to portraits; it was an indication of Banks' social standing at the conclusion of the Endeavour voyage, as well as the depth of his purse, that West agreed to paint him. West was closely associated with Joshua Reynolds, and it was a natural progression, for Banks, from a portrait by West to one by Reynolds. When Reynolds died in 1792, West succeeded him as President of the Royal Academy."

Largely self-taught, Westwood did not start painting professionally until his mid thirties and held his first exhibition in 1967. Prior to this he had an eclectic career in economics, advertising and the film industry. His decision to pursue an artistic vocation was prompted by a friendship with Jeffrey Smart and Justin O'Brien, with whom he had some lessons. His work was characterised by a dispassionate scrutiny of objects and a mannerly approach in their portrayal. Like fellow painter and friend, Margaret Olley (who sat for him on a number of occasions) he emphasised craft, conscientiousness and respect for tradition in his practice. His portraiture has been described as photorealist. He was the official artist appointed by the Federal Government to the 75th Anniversary of the Gallipoli landings in 1990, travelling with the veterans. The resulting paintings and sketches were exhibited at the Australian War Memorial. Westwood's work is represented in State and University collections throughout Australia and in the National Gallery of Australia, as well as in a number of corporate collections. His portraits of Prime Ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Fraser are currently on loan to the National Portrait Gallery and are on display in Kings Hall."

After studying half-heartedly at art school he travelled to Europe on a scholarship. In London he excited art dealers and fell under the influence of painters such as Francis Bacon. He won the international prize at the second Paris Biennale for Young Artists in 1961, and married his beautiful muse, Wendy Julius, the following year. Through the 1960s he exhibited around the world before returning to live on the Sydney harbourside. He began the 1970s with gentle pictures of birds, moving on to massive portraits of the poets Verlaine and Rimbaud before taking two years to paint the eighteen-panel Alchemy 1972-1973. He then turned to series of paintings of waves, interiors, the harbour, and coastal landscapes. In 1978, his annus mirabilis, he became the first artist to win the Archibald Prize for portraiture, the Wynne Prize for landscape and the Sulman Prize for genre painting all in the same year. He died of an overdose in a motel in Thirroul, New South Wales in the winter of 1992."

Iâ€™ve always understood, basically, that I used to be something else, that Iâ€™m a continuation of a particular kind of thread of human spirit, that the only thing that Iâ€™m involved in is the notion of interpreting time, in a sense that Iâ€™m alive. That the spirit will continue and itâ€™ll be the same as what it was, and various painters have given their flash at it and that in a summary is basically what Iâ€™m doing. Along with that, is like, the immense sense of the requirement towards survival so one gets more interested in the capacity for power, or in the various ways that can be appropriated. And that art has to follow that, has to employ it, if itâ€™s of any value.\\n\\nThereâ€™s no such a thing as Australian art because thereâ€™s probably no such a thing as Australia. Thereâ€™s a kind of ancient piece of immense and interesting and very strange land, which has had a few people come down on it and in a very surreal way started a kind of sensual civilisation. Itâ€™s got to a kind of point where weâ€™re suffering like the rest of the world with a kind of paralysis of confidence.\\n\\nI think that humankind are trying to force and press open a new area of brain think â€“ a capacity to sense, a broader knowing. In order to do that weâ€™re going to have in Godâ€™s, or in the puzzleâ€™s term, some sort of a major reckoning up. Weâ€™ve got death absolutely in our hands, a complete capacity to bang it out, and weâ€™re trying to force open this newer channel. I see, to a certain degree, that I along with numbers of other individuals, are trying to, you know, cause inside their own pressure, that breaking through, that kind of time. I mean, thereâ€™s immense relaxation inside it, but thereâ€™s also like the heat towards want, the necessity of the mystery of life, of the system of life, which is always, like, come and go.

His unique landscape vision emerged in the late 1950s, after his return from a period of study and work in London. The 1960s saw an increasing minimalism in his paintings, which reached its most extreme point at the end of the decade. In his monumental works of 1969, he attempted to evoke the vast scale of the Australian land through canvases of a single colour dotted with tiny flecks of paint. Although Williams later turned to representation of denser, more colourful terrain, his bare, uncompromising pictures of the 1960s contributed profoundly to subsequent interpretation of the Australian landscape. Williams made a number of portraits of friends and family members, particularly during the 1970s. He completed his first portrait commission, of Sir Louis Matheson, first Vice Chancellor of Monash University, in 1976; portraits of University of Melbourne figures followed. The National Portrait Gallery has his self portrait at the easel, and his portrait of Murray Bail, with whom he served on the Council of the National Gallery of Australia. Subjects of his other masterly portraits include Rudy Komon and John Brack."

While studying for his law degree, he worked as his father had, as a parliamentary reporter and journalist. Married in 1832, Richard was called to the Bar in 1834 - also the year that his only child, William Charles, was born. Encouraged by the opportunity to practice as a barrister in New South Wales, Richard left for the colony in 1835. In Sydney, Richard established a considerable practice and was noted as 'a barrister of superior abilities' and eloquence. Like his father, Richard acquired land in the Hunter Valley. Here, Windeyer built Tomago House (1843) and successfully cultivated 30 acres of vines, producing his first wine in 1845 with the assistance of several imported European workers. Richard was elected to the colony's first Legislative Council in 1843. He supported free trade and worked to open the British market to the colony's wheat. He was also interested in education, social welfare and law reform and became a member of the Aborigines Protection Society after appearing in trials arising from the Myall Creek atrocity of 1838. An 'able, enlightened, honest and uncompromising public man', Richard Windeyer died from a combination of illness, overwork and financial worries at the age of forty-one."

Thousands of people lined up to see his eight foot tall frame and witness his displays of linguistics (he was reportedly able to speak ten languages) and he was soon touring Europe and America. Accompanied by his wife, Kin Foo, he arrived in Australia from the United States in 1870 and toured the country over the next several years. While in Australia, after the death of his first wife, Chang met and married Catherine Santley and returned with her to China. They had two sons before moving to England. He attracted the attention of American showman and entrepreneur P.T Barnum who, in 1880, contracted Chang to join his so-called 'Greatest Show On Earth', a travelling circus, menagerie and museum of freakish human 'specimens'. Returning to England, Chang retired from the stage and, to help cure his suspected tuberculosis, moved with his family to Bournemouth. Here, he opened a tearooms and 'Oriental Bazaar' selling Chinese curios and fabrics. He died, reportedly of a broken heart, four months after the death of his wife in 1893"

While still a student, she won the Le Gay Brereton Prize for Drawing; she has since participated in countless solo and group exhibitions. From 1961 to 1971 she taught at various secondary schools and colleges; from 1972 to 1978 she taught at the West Australian Institute of Technology in Perth; from 1979 to 1985 she taught at Hornsby College of TAFE. Meanwhile, from 1967 she travelled widely through remote areas of Australia and abroad. She won the Wynne Prize in 1971 and the Portia Geach Memorial Awards in both 1983 and 1984. Recipient of a number of smaller prizes, she has been an Archibald finalist seven times, several times with self-portraits, of which she has made many over the course of her career (the â€˜hornedâ€™ turban is characteristic.) The Art Gallery of New South Wales has four of her works and she is represented in a number of regional galleries. Gavin Fryâ€™s monograph _Margaret Woodward_ was published by the Beagle Press in 2003."

                "content": "Thomas Woolner, sculptor, studied first with the brothers Henry and William Behnes, painter and sculptor respectively, and later at the Royal Academy, at which he was to become professor of sculpture in his fifties. As a young man he was a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and contributed poems to its journal, The Germ, including â€˜My Beautiful Ladyâ€™, expanding at some length on the themes â€˜I love my lady, she is very fair/ Her brow is wan, and bound by simple hairâ€™. His small sculpture Eleanor sucking the Poison from Prince Edwardâ€™s Wound (1843), exhibited at the Royal Academy, attracted much attention, but by 1850 he was engaged mostly on medallion portraits. \\n\\nWoolner came to Australia in1852 to try his luck on the Victorian goldfields, but was appalled by the conditions and soon resumed his sculptural work, making a number of plaster medallions of prominent Melbourne citizens including La Trobe. In 1854, Woolner spent a happy six months in Sydney, where various families and individuals commissioned portrait medallions. In all, during his stay in Australia, Woolner produced 24 portrait medallions. Some portraits, including those of LaTrobe and Wentworth, were copied more often than others. There were 25 subscribers listed for the LaTrobe medallion in the Melbourne Banner of 28 February 1854. Over a few months in 1854, print-sellers Woolcott and Clark at 555 George Street Sydney advertised that those interested in subscribing to a specimen of the Wentworth medallion could inspect the plaster version at their premises in Sydney. Woolner was heading for England on the Queen of the South; there, he would have his plaster impressions cast by the finest artisans in bronze, for shipment back to the colony. The price was five guineas per medallion and Woolcott and Clark promised that subscribers would receive their portraits within twelve months. Although he was commended for the likeness of Wentworth in the portrait medallion, he failed to obtain the hoped-for commission for the full-length statue of Wentworth that now stands in the Great Hall of the University of Sydney. \\n\\nHaving returned to England with his case of colonial medallions, Woolner continued his portrait sculpture practice. He made medallions of Tennyson, Browning, Carlyle, Palgrave and Hooker, amongst others; Gladstone, Darwin, Dickens, Huxley, Charles Kingsley, and Lord Cavendish were amongst his subjects. He made the statue of Lord Lawrence, Viceroy of India for Government House, Calcutta; that of Sir Stamford Raffles currently in Empress Place, Singapore; the statue of John Stuart Mill that stands on the Thames Embankment; and a bust of Alfred, Lord Tennyson for Westminster Abbey. He made the life-sized statue of Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, for the New Museum at Oxford and in 1879 he was commissioned to make the statue of Captain Cook that stands near the Australian Museum in Sydney. Woolner died the day after Tennyson, in October 1892. The National Portrait Gallery, London, has eight of his medallions and eleven of his busts, as well as a plethora of photographs of him."

We came to a shepherdâ€™s hut that was in a spot which might by labour be turned into a paradise. The manâ€™s wife and family were there. It has something wild and comfortable in aspect. One little girl was swinging, a graceful little creature. I will make a bas relief of her when I get back to England and the fine arts. The place where we are camped in is the most beautiful we have seen, and the wildest.\\n\\nChristmas â€“ and warm soft air, brilliant sunlight, plentiful flowering foliage, butterflies, innumerable common flies, voices of birds, almost as various and manifold as the vegetation. I can scarcely write for the flies buzzing about and irritating my eyes. The grass is pale yellow and more like hay than grass with the sunâ€™s heat. It dazzles my eyes to look across the plain where the heat is shaking the distance. All this should be strange to an Englishman, but somehow it seems all a matter of course to me. I knew before I left my own country that Time and Place were reversed here, so all I see appears appropriate. If anything comes better than I have been accustomed to, I enjoy; if worse, I endure it.\\n\\nI have seen 27 Christmas days now but never expected to see one like this. While I write in the full shine of a glorious day, my friends are in their beds sleeping, or perhaps a few rather â€˜jolly fellowsâ€™ may be winding home through the streets with raw, dark, dirty drizzle falling on them, after spending Christmas Eve. Well, I hope they may enjoy their plum pudding. I wish I could get my letters. Ah! If I could it would be better than a princeâ€™s feast to me, a Christmas luxury truly.",

                "content": "Judith Wright (1915â€“2000), poet, conservationist and Aboriginal land rights campaigner, was born at Thalgaroch Station, near Armidale, NSW, into a pastoralist family whose origins go back to the first settlement in the Hunter Valley in the 1820s. After studying English at the University of Sydney, she travelled in Europe from 1937 to 1938, before settling in Sydney to write. She wrote 'an occasional modest, thoughtful poem', but when Japan entered the war, she returned to help on the family property, Wollomombi. During this time, she rediscovered her love of the countryside and also had the opportunity to think deeply about her art, leading to the first intensely creative period of her writing. From 1943 to 1947 she worked at the University of Queensland, where she met and married the philosopher and writer J.P. McKinney. Her first major volume of poetry, _The Moving Image_ (1946) was said to have 'brought a sense of excitement and anticipation to the Australian literary world of the time'. It was followed by _Woman to Man_ (1949), which won the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry, _The Gateway_ (1953), _The Two Fires_ (1955), _Birds_ (1961), The _Other Half_ (1966), and _Alive_ (1973), among many others. She also wrote novels, short stories, children's stories and literacy criticism. A conservationist, Wright co-founded the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland and was president from 1964 and 1976. Through the 1960s and early 1970s she was devoted to protecting the Great Barrier Reef from oil drilling and campaigned against land mining on Fraser Island, which she evoked in her poem 'Australia 1970'. She was also an active supporter of Aboriginal land rights. The Canberra suburb 'Wright' is named after her."

A woman of the Waanyi nation of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Wright was raised by her mother and grandmother in Cloncurry, her non-Aboriginal cattleman father having died when she was five years old. Her first novel, _Plains of Promise_, was published in 1997 and was shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers Prize, a New South Wales Premierâ€™s Literary Award and the Age Book of the Year. Throughout the ensuing decade Wrightâ€™s short stories and essays were included in a number of anthologies and in journals such as _Overland_, _Australian Humanities Review_ and _Southerly_, and her criticism appeared in _The Age_ and _Meanjin_, among other publications. _Carpentaria,_ a 500-page-long novel about an Aboriginal family from the Gulf, was written in a style incorporating â€˜the way we tell stories and in the voice of our own people and our own way of speakingâ€™, and was initially rejected by several publishers. On its eventual appearance in 2006, however, it won a slew of awards including the Victorian, New South Wales and Queenslandâ€™s Premierâ€™s Literary Awards for Fiction; the Australian Book Industry Award for Book of the Year; and the Australian Literary Societyâ€™s gold medal, in addition to the Miles Franklin. Her third novel The _Swan Book_ (2014) was also awarded the ALS gold medal and was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin and the Victorian and New South Wales Premierâ€™s Awards. In addition, through her work as a researcher, activist and consultant with various Aboriginal organisations, she has published widely on Indigenous issues and land rights in Australia and overseas. Her non-fiction titles as author and editor include _Grog War_ (1997), examining alcohol abuse in the Northern Territory, and _Take Power_ (1998), an anthology of writing on land rights in Central Australia. Wright has undergraduate qualifications in social studies and creative writing and a doctorate from RMIT. She is currently a Distinguished Fellow of the Writing and Society Research Centre at the University of Western Sydney."

                "content": "William Yang (b. 1943) is a pre-eminent Australian photographer known for an intensely sustained body of work that examines issues of cultural and sexual identity, and which unflinchingly documents the lives of his friends and community and his own lived experience with curiosity, sensitivity and humour. He is known in particular for his documentation of the Sydney LGBTIQ+ community from the 1970s onwards, including the evolution of the Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras, and for photographic series engaging with the impact of HIV/AIDS on his friends and community, his sense of identity as a Chinese-Australian, and his family history and relationships.\\n\\nBorn in Mareeba, near Cairns, Yang grew up in a family who repudiated their Chinese heritage so as to escape the intolerance characteristic of mid-twentieth century Australia. He realised he was Chinese at age six, after being subjected to a bigoted taunt at school. He has recalled becoming aware of what homosexuality meant as a high school student in Cairns, when he came across an article that made him feel as if 'there were only four homosexuals in the world: Oscar Wilde, Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo â€“ and me'. He was given his first camera at seventeen, but became more serious about photography as a student at the University of Queensland, where he studied architecture and began writing and directing plays. In the late 1960s, he moved to Sydney. Having decided to make a living as a photographer, he attended numerous parties and events to take images of celebrities for the social pages of magazines, creating at the same time an unmistakeable and candid record of the city's creative cliques and subcultures. 'The arena suited me; it was more theatrical', Yang wrote in his Sydney Diary 1974â€“1984. 'Even as a playwright I'd always thought that real life set up better situations than you could ever think of yourself.'\\n\\nBy the mid-1970s his connections to the theatre and the creative arts had resulted in portraits of sitters such as artists Martin Sharp and Brett Whiteley; designers Linda Jackson and Jenny Kee; and theatre director Jim Sharman, whose friends and collaborators Yang also photographed. Two of the very first photographs purchased for the National Portrait Gallery's collection, for example, were Yang's portraits of actor Judy Davis (b. 1959), who in 1981 performed the title role in Sharman's production of _Lulu_ for the Sydney Theatre Company and the State Theatre Company of South Australia, and writer and Nobel laureate Patrick White (1912â€“1990), whom Yang first photographed in 1977, backstage after a performance of White's play _Big Toys_, directed by Sharman. Yang's first exhibition, _Sydneyphiles_, at the Australian Centre for Photography in 1977, established Yang (then Willy Young) as the preeminent freelance photographer and social documenter of the period. He changed his name from Young to Yang in 1983. He has since exhibited widely in Australia and abroad, also becoming known as a storyteller through his performance works which combine spoken word monologue, memoir and slide projection â€“ such as _Friends of Dorothy_, _Shadows_ and _Blood Links_ â€“ and series of photographs characterised by the use of text in the form of handwritten inscriptions.\\n\\nYang's work has been included in many significant group exhibitions such as _World without end_ (AGNSW, 2000); _Don't leave me this way: art in the age of AIDS_ (NGA, 1994); _Life Lines_ (QAGOMA, 2009); _On the edge: Australian photographers of the 1970s_ (San Diego Museum of Art, 1998); _Sydney Photographed_ (MCA, 1994); and _From Bondi to Uluru_ (Higashikawa Arts Centre, Hokkaido, 1993). A retrospective of his photographs, _Diaries_, was held at the State Library of New South Wales in 1998. In 2001 the National Portrait Gallery mounted the exhibition _William Yang: Australian Chinese_ which then toured widely in Australia. Yang has produced books including _Patrick White: The late years_ (1995), _Sadness_ (1996), _Friends of Dorothy_ (1997) and _China_ (2008). His works are held in major state galleries, the National Gallery of Australia and the National Portrait Gallery, for which Yang created the commissioned work _My Generation_ in 2008. In 2021 Queensland Art Gallery held the major survey exhibition _William Yang: Seeing and Being Seen_, and published a book of the same name."

But after that period, I started to do performance pieces. My photography changed a bit because one of the things that I undertook was to photograph my own family which represented the Chinese in Australia. I claimed my heritage in the 80s because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged.\\n\\nAnd the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields in the place where my uncle had been shot. I somehow knew that this was an important event because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event. And that was a very important moment in my life. I kept doing self-portraits and Iâ€™ve done about 40 of them.\\n\\nGradually I evolved to tell my own story and just photograph things about my own life. Iâ€™m very happy that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so I feel that Iâ€™m living my art as well as my life. And so thatâ€™s very satisfying for me.\\n\\nI had to come to terms with being Chinese, being gay and just feeling comfortable as a human being. There are lots of people who arenâ€™t comfortable about that, still. And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. Thatâ€™s been my philosophy.",

Glasgow-born, he and his older brother Malcolm formed the band in Sydney in 1973, with Angus soon adopting his trademark school uniform and energetic antics onstage. The bandâ€™s line-up was confirmed in 1974 when Ronald 'Bon' Scott joined AC/DC as lead singer. Between 1975 and 1977 they released their first five studio albums, all co-written by Angus, Malcolm and Bon. With four huge singles in Australia, the band was signed to an international deal, but American success did not come until the title track from their sixth album Highway to Hell reached number 17 on the US charts in 1979. The multi-platinum album was the last to feature Scott, who died of alcohol poisoning in London in February 1980. Significantly, however, largely thanks to Angus Young's star status, the band weathered the loss of Scott and his replacement by Brian Johnston. Back in Black was released five months after Scott's death and vastly outsold the bandâ€™s previous albums, going platinum 22 times in the USA alone. AC/DC have since released a further nine studio albums. In 2014 Malcolm Young retired due to worsening dementia; he was replaced as rhythm guitarist by his nephew Stevie. Johnston left in 2014 having been advised that he risked total hearing loss if he continued with the band. Angus Young is the only band member remaining from the heydays of the late 70s and early 80s. A biography of him, High Voltage: the life of Angus Young, was released in 2017. Back in Black is still held to be the second-highest-selling album of all time worldwide, after Michael Jackson's Thriller; and it is the USAâ€™s fifth-highest selling album ever."

After studying at East Sydney Technical College and Sydney College of the Arts, Zahalka began participating in group exhibitions in Australia and Germany in the early 1980s. Returning to university, she would later graduate with a Master of Fine Arts from the University of New South Wales in 1994.\\n\\nIn her practice Zahalka reconstructs recognisable imagery to explore concepts of identity, cultural and gender diversity, and the environment. Concepts of appropriation and the subversion of art historical motifs and signifiers are interwoven with the artist's restaging of historic portraiture and photography. The resulting works are intelligent, humorous and accessible. With a growing interest in ecology and the impact of humans on the environment Zahalka's 2019 series _Wild Life, Australia_ moved away from portraiture to reimagine Australian natural history dioramas; to reflect on the changing relationship between society and the natural world.\\n\\nShe has held over 40 solo exhibitions including the touring shows _Woven Threads_, _Leisureland_ and _Wild Life, Australia_. _Welcome to Sydney_ was shown in the International Terminal of Sydney Airport in 2003 and _Hall of Mirrors: Anne Zahalka Portraits_ was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery on the Canberra leg of an extensive tour in 2007. Zahalka's work was included in the international photography exhibition _Civilization: The Way We Live Now_, shown at the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, in 2018 and the National Gallery of Victoria in 2019.
