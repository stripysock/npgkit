In the early 1950s he became a company director with BHP, a position he held for thirty-two years. For fifteen years during this period he was also Chairman of Rheem Australia and Koitaki Ltd. His interest in the visual arts led him to accept the position of inaugural Chairman of the Board of the Australian National Gallery from 1982 to 1986. At the end of this period he established The Gordon Darling Australian Print Fund, which has acquired more than 6000 prints for the national collection to date. In 1991 he established the Gordon Darling Foundation, which provides funding and staff development opportunities for public art institutions Australia-wide. That year, too, he and his wife, Marilyn, initiated and facilitated the touring exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery. The interest generated by the exhibition led to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery. Amongst the very earliest acquisitions of the Gallery were gifts from Darling, who accepted the inaugural Board's invitation to become the Founding Patron of the Gallery in mid-1998. Since then he has enabled the acquisition of many key works for the Collection, and his support carried the Gallery to the opening of its new, dedicated home in December 2008. \\n\\nJiawei Shen (b. 1948) who painted the portrait of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark for the National Portrait Gallery in 2005, often places his sitters within evocative dreamlike or remembered settings. The backdrop of his portrait of Darling suggests the competition-winning design for the dedicated National Portrait Gallery â€“ the project the Founding Patron long envisaged and urged. Set apart from the rest of the Collection in the Gordon Darling Hall, and seeming to capture some of the natural light of the space, his portrait hangs adjacent to the boards listing the many donors and benefactors to the institution.",

Best known for his role as Wolverine in the _X-Men_ movies, Jackman grew up in Sydney and turned down a role in _Neighbours_ to focus on honing his skills at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts. Soon after graduating in 1994 he scored a role in the ABC television drama, _Correlli_, playing opposite Deborra-Lee Furness, who he married the following year. He won a Tony Award for his performance as Peter Allen in _The Boy from Oz_ (2003â€“2004), a Golden Globe for his role as Jean Valjean in the film _Les MisÃ©rables_ (2012) and a Grammy for _The Greatest Showman_ (2017). \\n\\nVincent Fantauzzo had organised to meet Jackman to take photos in preparation for this portrait, when Covid-19 hit and the actor flew back to New York. Instead, the portrait was based on an image by Furness and on Zoom chats between Jackman and Fantauzzo. 'There's a look in Hugh's eyes, itâ€™s a moment in a conversation with someone he knows and trusts. It's not a GQ photo shoot. There's a love and intimacy, a side of Hugh thatâ€™s not the showman, itâ€™s not Wolverine. I want people to walk in, see the portrait of Hugh and feel a real connection.'",

And when you get to know people, you learn so much from them. So I think I just became interested in people.\\n\\nSo Hugh asked for me to do his portrait. We actually share a lot of mutual friends, but you never know, itâ€™s like going on a blind date with someone, you meet up with them and you actually have a real great connection. Photographyâ€™s a big part of the portrait to me and I normally film people and just base the portrait on all my images and film so I can see those moments. Hughâ€™s son is very into art and quite creative and he wanted to bring his son along for the photo shoot. So I had a plan up my sleeve that I was gonna ask his son to talk to his Dad and pull the trigger on a camera. And then the virus hit. And then Hugh called me up the night before he was coming to do photographs at my house and said, â€˜If I donâ€™t jump on a plane tonight then Iâ€™m gonna get shut out of the U.S.â€™ And his family was there, so they had to fly off and that didnâ€™t happen. And then I made a video for Deb, Hughâ€™s wife, on how to shoot the portrait and I think because Deb took the pictures thereâ€™s this beautiful look in â€¦ The paintingâ€™s quite different to the photograph because I made it black and white and added my own touch to it, but thereâ€™s a look in Hughâ€™s eyes and you can tell itâ€™s a conversation with someone that he knows and trusts, itâ€™s not a GQ photo shoot which is probably great images as well. But I didnâ€™t want that; I wanted that intimacy we spoke about. So I think thereâ€™s a love and intimacy that I think Iâ€™ve got.",

It is an unframed canvas protruding 5 cm off the wall.\\n\\nPainted in black and white, the portrait is an immensely detailed photorealistic painting. Against a bright cream-white background, a relaxed smiling Jackman leans to the right of the frame, his left hand wrapped around the side of his neck, supporting his head. His gaze is fixed brightly on the viewer. His face occupies the top-right quarter of the frame while his shoulders and chest, in a dark grey t-shirt, occupy the bottom half, the white background filling the top-left.\\n\\nJackmanâ€™s kind eyes show a detailed reflection of his surroundings, his gaze warmly addressing a dark figure reflected in his irises. Deep creases and crowsâ€™ feet fan out from his eyes, above which are thick dark eyebrows, with grooved frown-lines interrupting his otherwise smooth forehead. His soft dark hair appears messily parted out of frame with just his hairline and a handful of individual wayward hairs in view. The edges of his hair and t-shirt and Jackmanâ€™s protruding ears are painted with less detail than the rest of his sharply focused face, giving the impression of a camera lensâ€™ blur.\\n\\nHis nose is prominent and descends into a dense salt and pepper stubble moustache which continues seamlessly into a beard. His facial hair extends up to his ears and down his rounded chin to his neck and is painted in exceptional detail, with each individual black white and grey follicle clearly visible. Amongst the facial hair his mouth is closed and upturned in a gentle smile. Half of his neck is obscured in shadow by his left wrist which hovers just below his chin as he leans into his palm.\\n\\nAudio description written and voiced by Kate Matthews",

An Anmatyerre woman, Kngwarreye was born at Alhalkere, Utopia Station in the Northern Territory. As she grew older she became a leader in Awelye (women's business), experienced in ceremonial body painting. In 1977 she was a founding member of the Utopia Women's Batik Group. Kngwarreye began to paint on canvas late in life, in 1988. During her brief career she produced thousands of canvases depicting the flowers, roots, dust and summer rains of her Country, the translucent colours built up with layered touches of paint to create an illusion of depth and movement. In 1998 a retrospective exhibition of Kngwarreye's work travelled around Australia, and ten years later _Utopia: The Genius of Emily Kame Kngwarreye_ showed in Japan. With that exhibition, Kngwarreye was recognised as one of the very greatest abstract artists of the twentieth century.\\n\\nFor more than twenty years, Jenny Sages went on annual expeditions to Central Australia. On one of these trips Sages arranged to meet Kngwarreye. The two women sat on the dusty ground talking while Sages sketched, capturing the changing expressions on the Anmatyerre woman's face. Back in her Sydney studio, Sages developed this huge, spare painting, portraying Kngwarreye sitting cross-legged in the quintessential Australian landscape of her Country.",

The painting was made by Jenny Sages in 1993, oil on canvas, and measures 2.16m tall by 1.85m wide, including its frame. The frame itself is discrete and simple, made from blond wood, and measuring about 2cm thick. \\n\\nThe portrait depicts Emily, close up, sitting cross legged, grounded on the earth, in the right foreground, and Lily, also sitting, some distance behind Emily, about half way up, and on the left edge of the picture. The focus and detail is on Emily, while Lily and the background landscape are less distinct. The warm orange-browns, yellows and whites, painted in loose, delicate brush strokes, shimmer and shine, capturing the heat of the day. \\n\\nThe background of the painting is flat and sparse, with no defined horizon, only a gentle gradient from lighter tones smudging together at the top, to darker shades in more defined strokes nearer the bottom. \\n\\nLily is shown at the very far left edge of the painting, her right side partially cropped. Her hair is a tangled mass of dark curls framing her round, dark skinned, face. Her face is angled slightly up to her left, as if she is turning towards Emily. Lilyâ€™s eyes seem to be on her friend and a smile plays over her closed lips. Lily wears a t-shirt, coloured in deep green-browns, with dashes of yellow where the light hits it. Her arms are loose with her hands resting, fingers just touching, in her lap. Lily is wearing a blue-green skirt and her bare legs are crossed.\\n\\nOn the ground between Lily and Emily is a pale grey-blue mass of lines which looks like the ashes of a small fire. \\n\\nThe portrait of Emily dominates the painting. Emily faces you directly, her head positioned straight on. Around her head, the brush strokes change from following the horizontal direction of the land in the background of the painting, to following the oval shape of her face, forming a sort of halo in whites and pale yellows. Emilyâ€™s white hair is cropped close to her skull, and her dark skin can be seen through it. Her forehead is high and elaborately furrowed â€“ the furrows having their nexus at, and are most prominent where her brows, eyes, and nose meet. Emilyâ€™s eyes are dark crevices, the irises barely visible, surrounded by wrinkled skin. Her nose is large and smooth, with wide nostrils, and her ears are long and lie flat against her head. Emilyâ€™s cheeks are bunched up and deep lines run beneath them, between her nose and mouth. Emilyâ€™s lips are closed, with the lower slightly fuller than the upper - they are difficult to read, perhaps the glimmer of a smile is passing over them, or they may be set in resignation. Beneath the lips she has a small round chin, around this, her skin is loose and falls into the shadows of her creased neck. \\n\\nWound about Emilyâ€™s neck and tied loosely at her front, is a scarf, painted in fine brush strokes of pale yellows, orange-ochres and greens. Her top too, is made from many colours, - haphazard strokes in orange and yellow are layered and criss-cross each other in rich texture over her broad, rounded, and relaxed shoulders. These warm colours give over to lilac, mint-green, and black brush strokes, weaving together, and defining the volume and contours of her chest. \\n\\nEmilyâ€™s elbows rest comfortably on the thighs of her crossed legs. Her bare forearms are covered in thick veins, her large, wrinkled hands come together at her shins, the left sitting lightly, partially over the right. Light falls on the hands, highlighting their creased skin, emphasising them. Emilyâ€™s skirt covers her crossed legs, and is white, with patches of bright orange-red and the suggestion of a floral pattern in greens and browns. Part of her left foot, in a white shoe, pokes out from under her right knee. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

A pioneer in the field of breast cancer treatment, she promoted the introduction of mammography and helped establish the National Breast Cancer Screening Program. Also a conservationist, Croll was one of a group of thirteen women â€“ the Battlers for Kelly's Bush â€“ whose campaign to protect bushland in Sydney's Hunters Hill in the early 1970s led to the world's first green ban. \\n\\nMelbourne-born John Brack emerged as one of Australia's foremost figurative artists in the 1950s with paintings such as _Collins Street, 5p.m._ (1955). Brack didn't consider himself a portraitist, yet he created a number of portraits that, like his images of ordinary people and urban scenes, are finely observed, sometimes austere examinations of everyday life. On being told that Brack had been commissioned to paint her, Croll wondered: 'Oh, what am I going to look like?' Brack made a number of sketches of her in Sydney and completed the painting â€“ the first of his few private portrait commissions â€“ in Melbourne. 'When I look at my portrait, I see somebody who likes fashion', Croll later said. 'And I see me ... I'm a bossy lady, and I look like a bossy lady.'",

It measures 165 centimetres by 119 centimetres.\\n\\nJoan Croll, formerly a breast physician and radiologist, is a conservation activist and vigorous writer of letters-to-the-editor. This oil on canvas portrait depicts her sitting upright on a French Provincial dining chair, legs crossed, with her hand on hip, looking straight at us, her expression stern. She is in the corner of a sparse mauve room, a large Persian carpet occupying much of the foreground. The floor appears to tilt, as if tipping toward us. The painting style is very exact with strong, straight outlines around flat colours with minimal shading.\\n\\nThe bare mauve walls fill the top third of the background. They meet in the exact middle of the picture and spread diagonally down to the left and right with huge umber skirting boards running along the base. The mauve floor fills the lower two thirds with the large intricately patterned Persian carpet lying on a diagonal angle to the right. The carpet is umber with yellow oxide complex patterns and white linear details. It is cropped at the bottom right corner of the painting.\\n\\nJoanâ€™s seated figure is positioned in the centre top half of the picture. She is sitting on an ornate French Provincial dining chair with an umber cushioned backrest, cushioned seat and cushioned arm rests. The wooden frame is light brown with umber decorative details.\\n\\nHer short, cropped hair, neat gradations of combed grey, frames her oval face. Tiny unadorned earlobes poke out from beneath it. She has fair skin, short straight eyebrows, hooded eyelids and large dark almond shaped eyes. She gazes at us, front on. Beneath her eyes are shadows and at their corners, creases. She has a long nose and thin closed lips. Her cheeks and chin are flat. \\n\\nJoan has a long neck creased below the jawline, narrow shoulders and lean arms. Her elbows flare out each side of her body, her right hand on her hip, her left elbow resting lightly on the arm of the dining chair. Her left wrist bent downward, her hand and fingers hanging loosely. Thereâ€™s a silver metallic bracelet wrapped around her left wrist, a thin band on her ring finger. \\n\\nShe is wearing a simple black sleeveless dress with a high neckline, knee length, sheer black stockings and black t-strap heels. Around her neck hangs a long string of white pearls. Her left leg crosses over her right resting in the air at a diagonal angle. Her right foot is firmly on the floor pointing toward us.\\n\\nAudio description written by Marina Neilson and ready by Carolyn Eccles",

Over his career he was also senior honorary consultant general surgeon at Lewisham and the Mater Misericordiae hospital on the North Shore, where he often performed operations for disadvantaged patients on Friday nights and was much-loved by the resident Sisters of Mercy. \\n\\nAn avid collector, MacMahon came to know William Dobell after accepting one of his paintings as payment from an impecunious patient. In 1957 Dobell was diagnosed with bowel cancer, and in 1958 MacMahon performed two difficult operations on him. The men spent a lot of time together while Dobell recovered at St. Vincent's, during which period Dobell started to paint MacMahon's portrait. It won Dobell his third Archibald Prize, in 1959. 'Dr MacMahon is an enormous person. I owe everything to him', said the artist, who was a regular in the doctorâ€™s family circle for the rest of his life.",

She established the Australian Dance Theatre in 1965, Australiaâ€™s first professional modern dance company, and was its artistic director for ten years. After moving to Lake George, New South Wales in 1989, Dalman founded the Mirramu Creative Arts Centre and later the Mirramu Dance Company, where her focus has been on the creation of site-specific works. She tours internationally as an actor/dancer, most recently with Michael Keegan-Dolanâ€™s award-winning _Swan Lake/Loch na hEala_.\\n\\nAnthea da Silva was awarded the 2020 Darling Portrait Prize for this painting of Dalman. She said of her winning work, 'I am inspired by Elizabethâ€™s constant reinvention as a dancer, choreographer, actor, director and environmental activist.' National Portrait Gallery Director Karen Quinlan AM said, 'Anthea da Silvaâ€™s Elizabeth, 2019, is a gentle, beguiling portrait that reveals the fragile, fluid nature of the human body. Here is a woman who has spent her life moving and while she is captured here sitting, she looks set to leap. We were struck by the deliberate power of the seemingly unfinished elements of the work because, like Elizabeth, the complete picture is yet to be filled in â€“ there is much yet for her to do.'",

In 1998, for her performance in the film _Radiance_, she became the first Aboriginal woman to win Best Actress at the AFI Awards; five years later she was named the NAIDOC Person of the Year. In 2012, she won Best Lead Actress for her role in _The Sapphires_ (2011) at the AACTA Awards. For _Mabo_ (2012) and _Redfern Now: Promise Me_ (2015), she won Most Outstanding Actress at the 2013 and 2016 Logies. In 2019 she starred in the ABC series _Total Control_, for which she won the AACTA Award for Best Lead Actor in a TV drama; the second series was filmed in 2021.\\n\\nEvert Ploeg painted this work on a panel of jute which he sourced from an old wool bale located in the rafters of his barn-like studio. 'I needed someone who was earthy, Australian, and my mind just naturally went to Deborah.' In speaking about the portrait to the Sydney Morning Herald, Mailman said: 'I feel he has brought to light a deeper, more contemplative side of myself.' The work was a 1999 Archibald Prize finalist.",

The original work is recessed in a larger, dark wood frame. Deborah is seated on the ground, barefoot and cross legged. The canvas onto which she has been painted is repurposed wool-bale jute; coarse, careworn, stained and dimpled, perforated in places from use, it bears letters and numbers relative to its previous life. \\n\\nIn the top left, stencilled black letters DM, below it - CRT- adjacent to Deborahâ€™s shoulder and almost halfway down the work, a nine digit batch number with a miniature map of Australia stamped in its centre. Continuing down, by her knee, the word WOOL upside down. In the bottom left corner Evertâ€™s concertina-like signature. On the other side, above her knee also upside down CLASS 1A\\n\\nThe jute wall meets a similarly coloured floor.\\n\\nDeborah sits with her arms behind her body, her weight resting on her bottom and her hands, torso straight, legs crossed.\\n\\nHer dark curly hair is drawn away from her face, centre parted and a curl is escaping from behind her left ear. She isnâ€™t wearing any jewellery. Deborahâ€™s skin is golden brown. Her head is angled slightly, her right ear out of view. She has a high forehead, her brow offers the suggestion of a furrow rising from between dark, manicured eyebrows and dark eyes. An even, rounded, prominent nose above wide, full, red-painted lips. Her lush mouth is closed, the edges turned up leaving small, vertically angled creases where the corners of her mouth meet her otherwise creaseless cheeks. She is looking out, beyond us, her gaze unfocused.\\n\\nShe wears a long-sleeved kaftan, its collar rising to meet her rounded chin on her right, and sliding perilously close to falling off and down her left arm. An opalescent, rounded shoulder and the shadowed crevice of her collar bone bared to our gaze. \\n\\nThe robeâ€™s deep V- neck hints at a braless cleavage, her lower body lost in the stiff folds of her white kaftan, its shade and texture contrasts dramatically; her smooth brown skin against the large, coarse, beige-and-tan jute squares behind. \\n\\nHer right knee is exposed where the robe has been pushed back. The flesh of her thigh and shin are pressed together, the underside of her knee in shadow and the rest of her leg disappears into wild sea of material in her lap. \\n\\nAt her left bent knee, material falls a short distance to the floor and covers her shin, leaving only her left, arched foot exposed, toes relaxed. \\n\\nIt is a full-length kaftan, ending beyond her crossed legs, outlining her calf and shin in the material. On the floor in the bottom right, 7 letters, inclusive of Sâ€™s and Nâ€™s, itâ€™s not clear what it says, letters splayed from her knee down her shin. At the bottom of the frame, on our left, the way light hits the tendons of her ankle gives the appearance of streak of golden body paint from her ankle to the bones of her foot.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Emma Bedford and Jody Holdback and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

Best known for his signature series of images, incorporating schoolgirls with flowers and _Alice in Wonderland_ figures and motifs, he exhibited prolifically throughout his career. Judy Cassab AO CBE painted this portrait of her friend in 1979, two years after he was awarded an OBE. Captured at the height of his career, Blackman is depicted as a confident and successful artist, comfortable in his surroundings, and portrayed through the artist's signature expressionist style. Shortlisted for the 1979 Archibald Prize, the painting shows Blackman in his then eponymous beret, seated before a large, leaning painting of a reclining, draped nude. At this time, the artist was working on a 'nightmare' series, inspired by Henry Fuseli's 1781 influential work; one of these paintings â€“ with a very similar composition to that shown in Cassab's portrait â€“ had just been acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1978. One of Australia's best-loved, most successful and prolific portrait painters, Cassab was an Archibald finalist 41 times. The Portrait Gallery currently holds sixteen portraits of notable Australians by Cassab, and four portraits of the artist â€“ including one self-portrait.",

But it was not really a sort of disciplined thing, it wasnâ€™t really a thought-out thing. It was a thing where it was chasing a substance, it was kind of style chasing a substance. Once the substance was realised in some sort of sense, then the operative thing was to make it function properly, make it function fully. Itâ€™s like, sort of, driving a little baby Austin, finally you become a mature enough driver to be able to run an E-type Jag or a very complex piece of machinery. You have the emotional equipment realised, but it is then to make it a public fact, it is then to make it kind of articulate, a real articulate message in plastic terms, that is, it must be, the feeling must be couched properly in paint, the image must be embedded properly in the paint, must be trapped, as Francis Bacon says very well, in the paint.\\n\\nWell, now I work not so haphazardly, get up very early in the morning, go to the studio, clean up all the brushes, tidy up the room, sweep the floor and start working in a very detached sort of way, and work through disinterest to interest, or work, labour, very long hours on making a painting function within itself in a fairly detached sort of way. But this only could have been done by this kind of organic growth of the personality, it couldnâ€™t have been done in the artificial sense, you canâ€™t outside impose thoughts, they have to grow.",

In 1933 he won the Wynne Prize, and was awarded a scholarship that enabled him to study and travel in London and Europe. After war service, including a period as an official war artist, he made the King George Memorial in Sydney. Ten years later, he completed the Newcastle Memorial before taking up grants to study in the USA, UK and Europe. He taught at the National Art School in Sydney from 1937 to 1967, retiring as its Head. A retrospective exhibition of his (sometimes controversially modernist) work was held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1978. The following year Margel Hinder observed that â€˜there is hardly a sculptor in Sydney who is not indebted to Lyndon in some measureâ€™. \\n\\nAs a sculpted self portrait, this work is a great rarity in Australian art history.",

They investigated things that interested them, they experimented and they researched. In the process they used the point or they used the chisel, they used the clay or they used all the many materials and colour and paint and so forth. The by-products have been regarded as art, so it is false in my opinion to commence teaching students on the assumption that you can teach art. You introduce them to investigation and inquiry, and through the research they will develop a means of communicating whatever they must communicate.\\n\\nIf I were asked to say something about my own sculpture, my own work, Iâ€™d find it most difficult to say very much at all. Iâ€™m of such a make-up that I like the challenge offered me by a client, who is usually an architect, when he comes to me and says, â€˜Look, here are the restrictions in which I want you to be as free as you possibly can.â€™ This is the exciting challenge. As far as Iâ€™m concerned, itâ€™s quite impossible for me to repeat the same type of thing building after building, or situation after situation. I havenâ€™t that strong emphasis of â€˜this is a Dadswell workâ€™ in me, perhaps this is a lacking, I donâ€™t know about that, but personally I feel that if I could take my client a little further than he expected to go and yet found himself willing to go, then Iâ€™ve done something that is tremendously important for him. I have an obligation and I think Iâ€™ve sort of worked it out in doing this, I think this is my job, in the experience; although Iâ€™ve been restrained Iâ€™ve learnt a great deal in this restraint.",

Travelling in Europe between 1898 and 1899, he continued his studies before returning to Australia via Canada and the United States. By 1901 he was back in Europe, where he was to remain until 1910 enjoying some critical, though little financial, success. Initially, he was sponsored by Dame Nellie Melba, whose sister Belle was married to Pattersonâ€™s brother Tom. During this time he became acquainted with Ramsay, with whom he shared a Paris studio, and who was to have an important influence on his work, particularly his self portraiture. Ramsay painted several brilliant portraits of Patterson, and Pattersonâ€™s Parisian self portrait from 1902 is a low-keyed highlight of the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. Pattersonâ€™s widow recalled â€˜my husband looked on Ramsay as an exceptional artist â€“ in fact, I know he felt he was the Australian artist whose work he most admiredâ€™. Melba, however, withdrew her support from Patterson, who had married without consulting her and whose work was going in a direction of which she disapproved, and transferred her favours to Ramsay. Having returned to Australia to be feted for his international experience, in 1915 Patterson travelled to Hawaii, where he made a series of woodcuts and put an end to his marriage. Migrating to Seattle, he taught and lectured at the University of Washington Art School from 1919 to 1947, marrying a fellow artist with whom he spent significant periods in Paris and Mexico. Now credited as Seattleâ€™s first modern artist, he became a US citizen in 1928 and did not return to Australia except for a brief, dispiriting visit in 1951.\\n\\n\\n\\nHugh Ramsay (1877â€“1906), painter, was runner-up for the National Gallery Travelling Scholarship in 1899, and sailed to Europe on the same ship as his fellow artist George Lambert. For fifteen months he painted and partied in a cold, grimy Paris studio, gaining some critical success while depending on the Lamberts for an occasional hot meal. In 1902 four of his paintings were chosen for exhibition at the New Salon, Paris; this extraordinary achievement earned him the patronage of Dame Nellie Melba, a relative of his friend Ambrose Patterson. When Ramsay fell ill, she funded his return to Victoria. Here, he worked hard, amassing works for his sole one-man exhibition (at Melbaâ€™s rented home in Toorak) before dying of consumption at the age of twenty-eight. It was widely acknowledged that he had the most brilliant potential of the artists of his generation. â€˜Had he lived longerâ€™, said Lambert, â€˜he would have beaten the lot of us.â€™",

His dark deep-set eye has a dark shadow beneath it, strongly contrasting with his pale creamy skin. His nose is large and slightly hooked and there is the hint of a moustache on his upper lip, his pale pink lips partially open as if caught in conversation. His pointed chin and strong jaw line are intensely defined above his wide long neck.\\n\\nAmbrose wears a cream round-necked knitted jumper with a check shirt revealed at collar and cuffs.\\n\\nHis left hand draped across the back of the chair is clasping four long fine paint brushes. The twist of his torso is emphasized by folds in the jumper sweeping down from his left shoulder to the right-hand side of his waist. His body and right arm face forward with the sleeve of his jumper pushed up above his elbow.\\n\\n**Audio description written and voiced by Krysia Kitch**",

Let me see now! Yes, I sang _Shells of the Ocean_ first, followed by _Cominâ€™ throâ€™ the Rye_. It was a great occasion, and I am by no means certain that I am not prouder of it than of anything I have done since.\\n\\nEven as a child of three or four, I was so passionately devoted to music that I remember frequently crawling under the piano and remaining quiet there for hours while listening to my motherâ€™s playing. Yes, my mother sang also, though she had not a particularly notable voice. But her sister, my Aunt Lizzie, possessed a soprano voice of extraordinary beauty and quality. Indeed, I feel sure my Aunt Lizzie would have enjoyed a brilliant career as a public singer, had she adopted it.\\n\\nI remember once our family moving into winter quarters at one of my fatherâ€™s outlying stations. I was 10 years old at the time, but I know I felt furious, on arrival, to find there was no piano. My gentle mother consoled me with the gift of a concertina which I taught myself to play during the three months that we lived there.\\n\\nOne Sunday, I was perhaps 13, we were visited by a worthy man, who chanced to be a particularly poor preacher. At the conclusion of his very long and (as we children thought) somewhat wearisome discourse, he suggested that we should sing a hymn. My mother asked me to play a familiar hymn but in revenge for having been so bored, I played â€“ to the horror of some and the secret delight of others â€“ a music hall ditty which had succeeded in penetrating our wilderness. It was called _You should see me Dance the Polka_. In the sequel, I received the well merited punishment of being sent to bed for the remainder of the day.",

She was accompanied by Mr Haddon Chambers, the playwright, and an Australian girl, Miss Johnstone. Madame Melba was great, and made me tell her all about myself, how many commissions Iâ€™d had over here and all that. She was intensely sympathetic, and I quite fell in love with her. I fancy she rather took to me, for some reason or another, as she seemed so interested, and told me she would be very angry with me if I didnâ€™t go and see her first thing when I get to London, and she promised quite voluntarily, of her own accord, to do everything she can to help me, which coming from such a person, is almost an assurance of success. With such a friend as Madame Melba, who knows everybody who is anything, well, it looks rosy for me, Auntie. My luckâ€™s in lately. My greatest fortune, next to having four pictures in the Salon, is to have been looked on favourable [sic] by Madame Melba.\\n\\nShe actually sat for half an hour for me, to do a sketch, but I was a bit flabbergasted and too nervous to do a chef dâ€™oeuvre. She has promised that she will pose for me in London. What an opportunity. Think of it. If I could make a successful portrait of her, Iâ€™m a made man.\\n\\nMadame Melbaâ€™s a charming lady, so natural, sincere and unaffected. Although sheâ€™s a great lady, you feel at home with her from the first, she doesnâ€™t put fears into your heart, as many in her position would, but makes you feel quite at your ease. I could tell you heaps of little incidents that happened during her one and a half hour stay at the studio, but wait till I see you, when perhaps Iâ€™ll have more to add.",

                    "transcript": "This full-length self-portrait of Australian artist Hugh Ramsay is a slim 102cm x 63 cm oil on canvas with a plain 12cm wide gold frame. \\n\\nThe overall impression is of the artist as a young man in a dark studio space. Ramsayâ€™s body is in profile, he turns to his left, his head facing us. His face and shoulder are brightly illuminated from the right, otherwise the interior is painted indistinct dull browns, beige, greys, and black. In comparison, the texture of the canvas surface varies. Some areas appear speedily painted with thick brushwork and thin streaks of lumpy red and gold, contrasting with the blended flesh tones in the artistâ€™s face. \\n\\nOn the left, behind Ramsay, a beige coloured floor rises steeply to meet stacked, stretched canvasâ€™ leaning against the studio wall. Some are tall and rectangular, there are two, smaller, gold-framed paintings leaning back to back. The scene on the foremost canvas is too dark to read. \\n\\nIn the lower left corner, two identical, small angular shapes project in from the edge of the painting suggesting the wooden feet of a studio easel. A kidney shaped artistâ€™s palette sits on a brown, thinly spoked four-legged stool, it reaches Ramsayâ€™s thigh.\\n\\nRamsayâ€™s head is almond shaped. His short, wavy brown hair lies flat on the top of his head, parted in the middle, cut cleanly above his ears. Beige and pink skin tones on the left side of his face contrast with his dark and featureless right side. He has a high and furrowed forehead, his deep-set left eye gazes forward, the shadow line of his long straight nose runs down to his closed mouth. \\n\\nHis jaw is long and pointed; jutting over his high, white shirt collar. The collar is stiff but the shirt, tucked into his trousers, is loose. A lightly knotted black tie delineates the curved profile of his chest and stomach. The generous shirtsleeve of his left arm is folded back above his forearm. His left hand holds a paintbrush and a small grey cloth, relaxed, wrist facing up. Ramsay stands with his legs apart; his right leg supports his weight while at a step distance in front; his left leg is slightly bent at the knee. \\n\\nThe artist wears plus four trousers which are high waisted, black and baggy, finishing beneath his knees. Long, black socks define his calves and merge into slim black shoes. His feet are splayed, at 90-degree angle to one another; the left foot is in profile and behind one of the stool legs, his right foot is facing the easel the artist is working on.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Annette Twyman and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

Walter Spong, her father, was a scene painter who had worked at the Theatre Royal in Bristol and at Drury Lane. Hired by the Brough and Boucicault Comedy Company, in 1888 he moved to Melbourne, where he became friends with Arthur Streeton and Tom Roberts (who soon painted Hilda's mother). Hilda first appeared on stage when she was fourteen. After taking acting lessons, she made her speaking debut in 1891 in the Brough and Boucicault production of _Dr Bill_. Two years later, Walter Spong established a company to showcase his daughter's talents. On the basis of triumphs in Melbourne and New Zealand, in 1896 she left Australia to establish her career in London, making her Drury Lane debut in _The Duchess of Coolgardie: A Romance of the Australian Gold Fields_. Before long she moved to New York City, where she was to star in 50 Broadway productions between 1898 and 1940.\\n\\nTom Roberts exhibited his portrait of Hilda Spong at the Art Society of New South Wales in 1893, where it was considered to be one of the best works in the show. At the time, Roberts painted many portraits of prominent actors, musicians and artists.",

A laugh is considered hard but I found I got on beautifully with it, and I have been laughing ever since. I always like to have a play with plenty of laughs in it. I love comedy. It is the first laugh that people think is hard but after that, once you learn to laugh on stage, itâ€™s no trouble.\\n\\nI was only a little girl then â€“ I wasnâ€™t fourteen. I used to go behind the scenes of the theatre in Sydney and Iâ€™d take tea with Fanny Brough, and there I became stagestruck. I was very anxious to go on the stage and my family did not wish me to, but after a great deal of persuading my father consented to let me try it once. He thought that after one experience, I would be tired of it. I went on in the company of Brough and Dion Boucicault, the younger. In one of the lines of my part I had to pick up the cassock of a clergyman and ask with a laugh: â€˜Whatâ€™s this, darling?â€™\\n\\nThen we went to Melbourne and they were afraid people would take offence at those words. Iâ€™m sure I couldnâ€™t see anything wrong about them. They cut them out and it nearly broke my heart. But that was my first experience in having lines cut. It is a great trouble to have lines cut out and scenes transposed after you have once learned them.\\n\\nI was a particularly ugly child at that time. My father used to say that I would never get on with such an ugly face and squeaky voice. I think that was one reason he didnâ€™t want me to go on the stage in the first place. I used to have essays and books sent me by the people in front, saying they had seen my performance and were sorry that I didnâ€™t know how to manage my voice. Oh, the people of Australia are delightful. They were awfully sweet and kind to me. I love every gum tree and every stone in Australia. No one would have any trouble in getting along on the stage there, if he had any talent at all, for people appreciate it. You go entirely on your merits in Australia.\\n\\n(Interview in the New York Times, February 18, 1900)",

This large work of the young performer is housed in a heavy, old, gold frame and modestly embellished with a lapping leaf design on its outer rim. The frame is substantial but not overly elaborate. The oil paint evenly coats the surface of the canvas and has a low satin sheen. The artist has employed a realistic style with some of the brush marks visible creating subtle texture and movement.\\n\\nArtfully arranged, a glowing Hilda stands centrally, poised as if about to dance.\\n\\nA background of deep, natural green frames the figure, and covers three quarters of the canvas from top to bottom. \\n\\nOn the top right-hand side of the work, the slim edge of a framed picture is visible however the details are indistinct. Adjacent to Hildaâ€™s left shoulder is a collection of long upward strokes in brown and black with touches of gold indicating some sort of plant reminiscent of rushes, the base of which is obscured by Hilda. The green backdrop seems to be made of fabric, indicated by the suggestion of folds and creases in the lower left-hand corner.  \\nBeneath her feet the hard, polished floor captures some reflected light in varying tones of chocolate, chocolate gold and red brown. \\n\\nHilda is a young woman with fair skin, auburn hair clipped up in a loose style and dark eyes that gaze upwards to her right. She has a rosy complexion, pink lips and a gentle smile.\\n\\nShe stands composed, her right foot pointed forward, and left hand gracefully holding out the sweep of her dress. In her right hand, raised up level with her eyes, she holds a large splayed white fan, extending above her head and trailing parallel to her angled body. The fan enhances Hildaâ€™s theatrical pose. \\n\\nHilda is wearing a flowing golden, empire-line dress, extending to the tips of her toes. The v shaped neckline is trimmed with lace of the same golden hue as the dress. A section of fabric wraps around her chest, it ties in large bow peeping from behind her back and trails the length of her skirt. The sleeves, puffed at the shoulder, fit tightly along her arm and extend to below the elbow. She is wearing long, fingerless evening gloves, typical of the time. \\n\\nBarely visible in the bottom left hand corner is the artistâ€™s signature, scratched into the surface of the paint.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Sally Adair and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

She exhibited paintings with the Victorian Artist's Society between 1888 and 1892; and appears to have started making frames during the 1890s. She married artist Tom Roberts, a family friend, after a long courtship, in April 1896 and then moved to Sydney, where their only child, Caleb, was born in 1898. In 1903, dispirited at the lack of patronage in Australia, Roberts took his family to London, where Lillie trained in woodcarving and gilding. She later received a number of awards for her picture frames, examples of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1908 and the Imperial Exhibition in 1909. They returned to Australia in 1923 and settled at Kallista in the Dandenongs, east of Melbourne. Two years after Lillie's death in 1928, Roberts remarried; his second wife, Jean Boyes, was one of Lillie's oldest friends.\\n\\nThis work is one of few existing paintings by Roberts known to be framed in a frame designed and carved by his wife.",

                    "transcript": "This portrait of Mrs Tom Roberts (Elizabeth) was painted in oil on canvas by her husband Tom Roberts in 1910. Elizabeth Roberts designed the ornate gold frame herself. It measures 96 cm by 84 cm and it is 22 cm deep. Large scrolls of decorative leaves adorn the middle of the frameâ€™s top, bottom and sides and also cap each corner.\\n\\nThe canvas itself measures 74.1 cm by 60.8 cm. The overall colour tones of the plain background are subdued; pale, matte grey and green contrast strongly with the luminosity with which Mrs Robertsâ€™ face is highlighted. Mrs Roberts sits in a central position in the composition. Sheâ€™s turned at a 45-degree angle facing out of the picture to our right. Her upper body occupies most of the space. Her large hat is cropped at the top of the painting, her shoulders stretch across most of the canvas and at the base of the painting her hands rest on her lap. The painting style is realistic, with more detail in the face, the clothes becoming even softer and less distinct the further away from her face.\\n\\nMrs Robertsâ€™ black hat is perched on the very top of her head, an ascending wrap of black chiffon forming a tall helmet shape. A swathe of the semi-transparent fabric hangs down her back from the top of the hat to behind and below her right shoulder, appearing black as it folds over itself and light grey between. Her head is turned to the right and slightly tilted back, showing a profile of pale flesh with a little pink blush around her cheek and underlying yellow tones especially around and under her eye. Her expression is engaged but not smiling. \\n\\nA narrow forehead under the beak of her hat is framed by auburn brown hair with shades of grey, which is brushed back and pinned up behind her head. \\n\\nHer eyebrows are dark, thin and arched, her eyes are an indistinct blue, they gaze out of the portrait space through pince-nez glasses, circular lenses with thin wire rims sit on her nose. She has a straight slightly upturned nose and a small pale pink mouth. \\n\\nA tight white collar sits under her soft chin and neck. A yellow neck scarf with touches of green is knotted and tucked into her long-sleeve dark slate grey jacket which is buttoned at her mid chest. A very thin white chain hangs in a loop under a soft fur stole which wraps around Mrs Robertsâ€™ shoulders and over and down her chest. The light soft brown of the fur continues with a matching muffler. Mrs Robertsâ€™ gloved hand can just be seen as it disappears into it.\\n\\n**Audio description written and voiced by Annette Twyman, 2021**",

His father had a shop that was the first outlet for the _Freeman's Journal_, a Sydney-based journal of Irish and Catholic news and affairs. James began work for the paper at a young age; he was its sub-editor for many years, as well as a contributor to several other Sydney and Melbourne newspapers. While in his early twenties, he wrote _The most Rev. Roger Bede Vaughan, D.D., O.S.B., Archbishop of Sydney, life and labours_: containing an account of his career from opening to close, a review of his writings, speeches and ecclesiastical work: together with some personal sketches never before published (1883). His biography of Moran, His Eminence, Australia's first cardinal, prince of the church and public man: an appreciation of Cardinal Moran's work as prelate and philanthropist, scholar and statesman: in celebration of his sacerdotal golden jubilee was published in 1902. Over the 1890s Donovan established a reputation as a melodious singer and elocutionist in benefit concerts and liedertafel nights. His various talents combined with his knowledge of Sydney's history, his amusing discourse and his pleasant manner to make him very well-known about town. After he died, several papers lamented that he had not completed an account of his own life, times and acquaintances.",

Arriving in Sydney in 1843, he performed across the country before opening a theatre in Adelaide in 1846. His commercial holdings increased over the next few years, but in 1851 he lost his fortune. Through performing on the goldfields, he rebuilt a portfolio of theatres and hotels. In 1858 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council, but after five years, in serious debt, he resigned and returned to tread the boards. In 1874 he became a member of the Legislative Assembly; he held this post intermittently to 1888, after which he returned to the Council. Victoriaâ€™s first Freemason Grand Master, he energetically promoted reforms and innovation in the municipal sphere, including copyright legislation, the establishment of Post Office Savings banks, the St John Ambulance Society, the Old Colonistsâ€™ Association, the Dramatic and Musical Society, and the development of Sorrento as a tourist destination.",

If he is a bad actor and unpopular, he can put his name in large letters and fill the theatre with free admission to make it appear that he is attractive â€“ for which he has to pay the penalty of â€˜egotismâ€™.\\n\\nMy great desire was to leave myself out of the â€˜billâ€™ whenever I could â€“ not that I dislike acting, on the contrary I used to thoroughly enjoy it â€“ but because I think a manager has quite enough to do to look after the Treasury. It was no easy task to carry out the position of sole manager of the Theatre Royal, the Olympic Theatre and Cremorne Gardens at the same time.\\n\\nThe rule of my life has been to balance accounts and take stock every week. Very easily done with a ready money business.\\n\\nIn making the public acquainted with my checkered life, I intend to restrict myself to facts, and shall endeavour to give the opinion of others, avoiding anything approaching egotism.\\n\\nMy great misfortune is to neglect to keep a diary. Let me here impress upon all young people, no matter what their prospects in life might be, the great value of keeping a diary. Five or ten minutes in the morning or evening is the only trouble it would give, while the pleasure of reading it occasionally after years would fully repay you, with the chance of a history of your life becoming of financial value to your family as it no doubt would have been in my case.",

In 1886 he and his sister Nina joined Robert Brough to form the Brough and Boucicault Comedy Company, ushering in a golden age of Australian theatre. The company made its bases in Melbourneâ€™s Bijou Theatre and Sydneyâ€™s Criterion, but when the Bijou burned down in 1889, Boucicault lost his large private collection of costumes. After that, although audiences still loved him, he lost interest in the company and in 1896, having toured for three years, he retired exhausted to London. He came back to Australia in 1923 and made a final tour in 1927.",

In 1887 he was appointed to the Legislative Council; he resigned five years later to become president of the Council of Arbitration, but returned to politics from 1895 to 1898. He served on various boards and inquiries, and was a commissioner for the Philadelphia International Exhibition of 1876 and the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879.\\n\\nThis work is from the series of portraits on cedar panels painted by Tom Roberts during the 1890s.

With Roberts, McCubbin and Charles Conder, Streeton was a core member of the group of landscape artists known as the â€˜Heidelberg Schoolâ€™. In 1889 he painted Golden Summer, Eaglemont and exhibited 40 works â€“ mostly painted on cedar cigar-box lids â€“ in the â€˜9 x 5 Impressionsâ€™ exhibition in Melbourne. He moved to Sydney the following year and lived for a time with Roberts and others in a harbourside bush camp near Mosman. Over the next several years, Streeton painted the â€˜great, gold plainsâ€™, the harbour and pioneer scenes including the hot, bright Fireâ€™s on (1891). Streeton went to England in 1897 and remained there until 1923. He continued to paint landscapes on his return to Australia and became the art critic for the Argus in the late 1920s.",

The Duke and his Duchess, Mary (1867â€“1953) left England on 15 March aboard an Orient steamship specially chartered for the voyage. Two days after arriving in Melbourne, on 9 May, the royal couple drove through streets lined with cheering crowds to the Exhibition Building, where the Duke declared the Parliament open before thousands of guests. Later the same month it was confirmed in a letter to new Prime Minister Edmund Barton that â€˜Mr Tom Robertsâ€™ had undertaken to create a painting of the event. â€˜This gentleman is desirous of getting sittings of the Duke and Duchess before they leave Australiaâ€™, the letter continued. In 1903, when Roberts was in London working on the project, he requested portraits of the Duke and Duchess from his friend, photographer Walter Barnett. Roberts then referred to these photographs in the completion of his â€˜Big Pictureâ€™, which contains over 200 individual portraits.",

Roberts was paid nearly 2 000 guineas to complete the work â€“ a feat which took two and a half years and required numerous individual sittings with subjects in Melbourne, Sydney, London and elsewhere. Completed on three separate panels to facilitate transport, the painting was sent from England to France for photo-engraving. This is one of the resulting prints, which were sold to recover some of the cost involved in creating the work. For Roberts, the Big Picture was onerous, and he was grieved when it failed to boost his career. After it was shown at the Royal Academy in 1904, it was presented by the Commonwealth to King Edward VII. The painting, three metres high and five metres wide, returned to Australia on permanent loan in 1958 and is now displayed in Parliament House in a space specifically designed to accommodate it.",

Of Polish, Irish and Scottish heritage, she was the eldest child of socially progressive parents who fostered her interest in issues of education and welfare. After attending Presbyterian Ladies College, Melbourne, she opened a school with her sisters and during the same period became active in the fight for womenâ€™s suffrage. She was appointed general secretary of the United Council for Womenâ€™s Suffrage in 1900 and established the paper The Womanâ€™s Sphere. An able, quick-witted public speaker, in America in 1902 she gave evidence to a Congressional committee on womenâ€™s suffrage and attended the International Council of Women Conference before returning home to run for a Senate seat in the 1903 Federal election. She was unsuccessful despite attracting over 50 000 votes. Undeterred, she set about to educate women on the matter of the vote, Victorian women still being unable to vote in state elections despite being granted the right to do so in Federal polls in 1902. Goldstein stood for parliament again, without success, in 1910, 1913, 1914 and 1917, campaigning on equal pay, equal property rights, industrial reform and many other issues. She launched her second paper, the weekly Woman Voter in 1909; and in 1911 the militant Womenâ€™s Social and Political Union invited her to London, where she was touted as â€˜one of the foremost leaders of the Australian womenâ€™s movement â€¦ now helping her sisters in England to win their freedomâ€™. A committed pacifist, during World War I she served as chairman of the Peace Alliance and formed the Womenâ€™s Peace Army with the English suffragette, Adela Pankhurst. After the war she took an increasing interest in international matters, advocating disarmament and the pursuit of better living standards. She died from cancer in 1949.\\n\\nThis photograph shows Vida Goldstein (right) with compatriots Margaret Fisher (centre) and Emily McGowen (second from right) â€“ the wives of the Australian prime minister and NSW premier â€“ who led the Australian marchers in the 1911 Suffragette Demonstration.

She grew up in Western Australia, where in 1905 she married John Winthrop Hackett, newspaper proprietor and politician. During the First World War she raised funds for the war effort and wrote _The Australian Household Guide_, the profits from which went to various charities. Widowed in 1916, she moved to Adelaide and married Frank Moulden, who was made Mayor of Adelaide a few years later. As Lady Mayoress she raised enormous sums for Adelaide's charities. In 1923 she became interested in tantalite, a scarce mineral. After visiting potential sites in in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, she travelled to the USA to secure a contract to supply ore. She incorporated Tantalite Ltd while living in London in 1932. After Frank died she married barrister Basil Buller Murphy and lived in Melbourne, raising funds for the women's auxiliaries of various hospitals and serving on diverse welfare committees.\\n\\nDeborah's first husband John Winthrop Hackett was a patron of artist Florence Fuller, and it is said that he and Deborah are portrayed in her 1905 masterpiece _A Golden Hour_. In this portrait, Fuller has captured her young sitter's beauty and elegance, while also revealing her intelligence and determination through her direct gaze.",

It breaks much new ground. It treats practically with problems with which the Australian mother of a family and the Australian housekeeper are confronted day by day, year in and year out. No effort has been spared to make the work the most generally useful publication on the subject of domestic economy which has emanated from the Australian press.\\n\\nThe series of articles which it contains embraces such various subjects as: _Foods; their Functions and Values, The Australian Baby, The Kindergarten, What Young People Should Know, General Hygiene, Home Nursing, Hints upon Personal Appearance, The Home Garden, Poultry Keeping, Domestic Animals and The Typhoid or House Fly_ and _Insect Pests_.\\n\\nEach of these articles has been written by an expert, who speaks with authority upon the subject treated of. The recipes, some 3,500 in number and dealing with every branch of the culinary art and every department of household management have not been collected or collated haphazard [sic] but carefully selected by competent advisers, the great majority being actually contributed and vouched for by the correspondents, whose reliability and knowledge every reasonable care has been taken to ascertain and determine.\\n\\nSince the entire net proceeds of _The Australian Household Guide_ are to be devoted to charities it is hoped that its reception in Australian homes and its appreciation by Australian mothers will warrant the early publication of a second edition.",

                    "transcript": "This portrait of Deborah Vernon Hackett was made around 1908 by Florence Ada Fuller. It is painted with oil on canvas and measures 82 centimetres tall by 64 centimetres wide. The ornate gold frame is 13 centimetres wide. At the lower edge in the centre of the frame in black handwritten print is the inscription Mrs J.W. Hackett aet. 16. and beneath this F.A. Fuller.\\n\\nThe young woman is painted realistically with light brushstrokes and soft edges. She is positioned centrally, taking up the bottom two thirds of the canvas in front of a plain dark background. Deborah looks directly towards us. She is visible to her thigh which is seated in a cane chair. \\n\\nThe background is dark olive green. Vertical lines near the top of the painting suggest the folds of a curtain. This graduates to deep shadows that are almost black on the lower left.\\n\\nDeborah wears a large black hat with a low flat crown. A few dashes of paint indicate a bow of gauzy ribbon peeping above the wide brim that sweeps upwards on either side of her head. Her medium-brown hair is drawn off her forehead and curves up and out, giving volume and framing her face. The rest of the hair hangs loose behind her, with a small section falling in gentle waves over her left shoulder. \\n\\nLight touches Deborahâ€™s face from the right of the painting, leaving the left side in partial shadow. Her oval face has a smooth fair complexion and cheeks tinged with delicate pink. Her brown eyebrows are fine and straight. Deborahâ€™s sea-blue eyes look directly at us, their outer edges follow a slightly downwards lilt. Her nose is straight, leading to small shapely lips. The corners of her mouth are slightly upturned, the rose-pink lips are closed. Deborah has a faint groove just beneath her lower lip and a little round chin.\\n\\nA band of cream open lacework encircles Deborahâ€™s neck and extends over her chest. It is secured beneath her chin with a slender gold pin. A long strand of pale pink irregularly shaped stones also hangs about her neck. Her dress is light blue-green, and the fabric looks almost sheer, with a subtle silk-like sheen. Cream-coloured lace runs horizontally across the upper bodice, further ornamented in the middle of her chest by an oblong-shaped reddish gold pin. The sleeves are embellished with lace above the elbows and on the lower edges of the cuffs.\\n\\nThe cuffs of her wide sleeves hang elegantly from her wrists, creating strong almost-vertical lines in parallel with the arm of the straw-coloured cane chair. Deborahâ€™s left hand, displaying the glint of a gold band on her ring finger, is lightly placed over her right on the top of the chairâ€™s arm. Beneath her hands the rounded scroll-shaped edge of the chair is emphasized by its plaited edge.\\n\\nThe back of the cane chair curves down from the arm around her body following the sloping line of Deborahâ€™s left hip at the lower right of the painting. On the bottom left the artistâ€™s signature F. A. Fuller can be seen faintly in brownish pink over the dark background.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucinda Shawcross and voiced by Amy Middleby**",

Founder of the Victorian Arts and Crafts Society, she was secretary of the committee who organised the First Australian Exhibition of Women's Work in Melbourne, now considered a landmark event in the history of womenâ€™s art in Australia. After travelling to England in June 1914, Chomley was prevented from getting home by the outbreak of war. She threw herself into work: teaching English to refugees and volunteering at the Robert Lindsay Memorial Hospital for Officers. In 1916, she joined the Australian Red Cross, coordinating a team of volunteers to distribute thousands of parcels to prisoners of war. Remaining in London after the armistice, Chomley worked with organisations investigating working conditions and opportunities for British immigrant women in Australia. She returned permanently to Melbourne in 1934, resuming her work with the Victoria League for Commonwealth Friendship and the Arts and Crafts Society. \\n\\nWell-known for her sophisticated portraits of assured, commanding women, Violet Teague's elegant and vivacious painting of Chomley was considered to be a stand out when shown in a solo exhibition held at the Guild Hall in Melbourne in 1909. Teague and Chomley knew each other socially and were both involved in the Arts and Crafts Society.",

From 1908 to 1931 she championed a variety of social causes as editor of the women's page of the _Australian Worker_, including women's suffrage, children's welfare and aged and invalid pensions. In 1930 she published _The Wild Swan_, a book of verse decrying white settlers' ravaging of the land and indifference to Aboriginal culture; _Under the Wilgas_ (1932) and subsequent works expanded on this theme. Between 1891 and 1961 at least thirteen portraits were made of Gilmore by various artists, an indication of her importance as a feminist and social crusader. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1937 for her contribution to Australian life and literature. Her State funeral in Sydney was the first for an Australian writer since that of her friend â€“ possibly, briefly, her boyfriend â€“ Henry Lawson, 40 years earlier. She is featured on the Australian $10 note and the Canberra suburb Gilmore is named after her.\\n\\nIn this portrait, prolific artist Lyall Trindall has depicted Dame Mary Gilmore as strong, determined and slightly forbidding. At the time the work was painted, Gilmore was assembling the poems in _Battlefields_ (1939), the title referring to her campaigns for the underprivileged.",

Of course, I go such a long way back, 95 years and now nearly going on for 96. Iâ€™ve seen the beginnings. I began myself with a slush lamp, went onto the tallow candle, then to the imported stearin candle, and then to kerosene lamps and from kerosene to gas, from gas to the electric light and now we have ahead of us the atomic to cover every mortal thing that we can think of. It seems an astounding thing for one personâ€™s recollections.\\n\\nI remember the poor old convicts, so many of them â€“ they worked for my father, some of them. Some of them had backs that were ridged and ridged from the lash. I remember one station owner, a big rich man, and it was noted by his men that when they would go in swimming heâ€™d sit on the bank and he wouldnâ€™t go in. And one day without thinking, the poor man pulled his shirt off and jumped in. Father was in the water, so he caught hold of his arm and said, â€˜Come on, weâ€™ll go race to a different placeâ€™, and he took him right away from where the men could see him. His back was ridged too. And that was how the land was begun, how it was settled in the beginning, how the big Australia with its wide range of international linkings now, began. And those were the people who began it.\\n\\nWell, we have the Blacks for our background for stories and we have the convicts. In later years, when my book _The Passionate Heart_ was published, I wrote a piece of verse for it on that subject, because I was full of indignation at the idiocy of letting go in silence what was our basic history, and I still feel that way. Itâ€™s called _Old Botany Bay_.",

School captain and captain of football, cricket and rowing at Melbourne Grammar School, he graduated from Cambridge with a rowing blue before fighting at Gallipoli and winning the Military Cross at Suvla Bay (later he was awarded the Croix de Guerre avec Palme). Returning to Australia he took over the family softgoods importing business, in which he remained involved after being elected the National Party member for Flinders in 1918. As prime minister, he governed in coalition with the newly-formed Country party, packaging his policy as â€˜Men, Money and Marketsâ€™. He encouraged families to emigrate from Britain and settle on the land, while he secured loans from London financiers to fund infrastructure development. In turn, the British market opened up to Australian wool, wheat and other goods. After struggling with industrial relations issues, Bruce became the first of only two Australian prime ministers to date to lose his own seat at an election. Nonetheless, he remained an influential mediator between Great Britain and Australia and was the first Australian delegate to the League of Nations, where he distinguished himself through the 1930s. Having been made a Companion of Honour in 1927, he was created 1st Viscount Bruce of Melbourne twenty years later. The inaugural inhabitant of the Lodge, Bruce was the first Chancellor of the Australian National University and a founding member of the Royal Canberra Golf Club (he was the first Australian Captain of the â€˜home of golf â€™, the Scottish Royal and Ancient St Andrewâ€™s Golf Club). Although he died in London, his ashes were scattered from a plane over Lake Burley Griffin; he is the only prime minister whose remains â€˜lieâ€™ in Canberra.\\n\\n\\n\\nBarbara Tribe (1913â€“2000) was born in Sydney, where she enrolled at East Sydney Technical College at the age of fifteen. Having studied with Rayner Hoff, in 1935 she became the first woman and the first sculptor to win the NSW Travelling Art Scholarship. Throughout the war she remained in England, working in the Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments before settling in Cornwall. Tribeâ€™s portraits are represented in the Australian War Memorial and the National Gallery of Australia as well as the National Portrait Gallery.",

Birdwood served with distinction on Lord Kitchenerâ€™s staff during the Boer War. When the First World War began, Kitchener put him in command of the Australian and New Zealand forces bound for Europe. He met them in Egypt at the end of 1914; four months later they landed at Gallipoli. Here Birdwood regularly visited the front lines, and swam daily at the place he named Anzac Cove. Though opposed to it, he oversaw the successful withdrawal of troops in December 1915. Soon after, the ANZAC Corps was split in two. Birdwood accompanied I ANZAC Corps to France, and directed its operations throughout 1916 and 1917; he took command of the Australian Corps when it was formed from the five AIF divisions in November 1917. Despite his having led them through disastrous Western Front actions, Birdwood won far more respect from Australian soldiers than did most British senior commanders. \\n\\nBarbara Tribe studied with Rayner Hoff at East Sydney Technical College and in 1935 became the first woman and the first sculptor to win the New South Wales Travelling Art Scholarship. She remained in the UK after her scholarship expired, working in the Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments during the war and afterwards at the Penzance School of Arts. Birdwood posed for Tribe in her Kensington studio, wearing medals that he had purposely withdrawn from the bank.",

As time goes on, the bonds that brought us all together and kept us together â€“ bonds of common loyalty, determination of each of us to do our utmost for the cause for which we fought and, as far as I am concerned, of esteem, affection and pride in my comrades â€“ have drawn much closer as the years pass by.\\n\\nThe reception given to me in Perth by the very large number of my old AIF comrades can leave no doubt in the mind of anyone as to the fact that old memories are not forgotten and we can each of us feel that we are still members of that band of brothers which I believe we all hoped ourselves to be at Anzac.\\n\\nThe long-forgotten memories revived as we have together fought our battles over again â€“ incidentally, perhaps, revivified by my recent visit to the peninsula â€“ have indeed been wonderful, and have often brought back, so clearly, thoughts of the gallant deeds of some of our bravest who, alas, are now no longer with us.\\n\\nAmongst others whom I have been able to visit are the comparatively large numbers who, Iâ€™m sorry to say, are still in hospital. It must sound paradoxical to say that I have been both glad and sorry to see them; really deeply sorry that after all these years there should still be men suffering as a result of wounds, gas and TB, but proud and glad to see the really wonderful way in which, without exception, their suffering is being faced and cheerfully borne. Indeed, the bearing of these men is an object lesson to every one of us.",

Having begun his career in engineering and construction in Melbourne, he was appointed to lead the 4th Infantry Brigade of the AIF in Egypt. After heading his troops at Gallipoli, in 1916 he moved to the Western Front, where he was to earn great renown as a tactician, dedicated to minimising casualties through rigorous training, detailed planning and strong technical and mechanical support of his troops. He was promoted to command the Australian Corps in 1918; in July that year, he masterminded the Corpsâ€™s involvement in the decisive Battle of Hamel. The first Jew to head a major army in the First World War, he returned with copious honours, though he abhorred the â€˜dreadful inefficiency of, and the misspent energy of, warâ€™. For his work on engineering applied to modern warfare, Monash was awarded the first doctorate in engineering from an Australian university. On his return to civilian life, Monash became General Manager, then Chairman, of the Victorian State Electricity Commission. Involved with a number of public organisations, he remained a much-loved public figure in Victoria until his death; his State funeral was attended by some 300 000 people.",

The Coles retail dynasty began when the first George Coles arrived in Victoria in the 1850s and established a butchery. His son, George, bought it and went on to open a number of country stores. In turn, his son â€“ the George Coles in this portrait â€“ bought and sold various businesses from his father before opening his first store in 1914. After World War 1 he opened his first â€˜nothing over 2/6-â€™ store in Collingwood. Over the course of the twentieth century, as the firm went on to acquire many other retail chains, George Coles and four of his brothers worked up through the company to become directors. A substantial personal philanthropist, Coles was at various times a President of the Rotary Club and Warden of St Johnâ€™s Anglican Church, Toorak; he was for 14 years Foundation President of the Institute of Public Affairs and for 22 years a Director of the National Australasia Bank. GJ Coles and Coy merged with the Myer company in late 1985; the Coles Group was acquired by Wesfarmers in 2007.\\n\\nWilliam Beckwith (Bill) McInnes (1889â€“1939) trained at the National Gallery of Victoria School and later undertook study tours of Europe and the UK.

Beginning in 1921, McInnes won five of the first six Archibald Prizes, writing in defence of his conservative work that â€˜in Australia we have not been bitten by Cubism or Futurism or other isms â€¦ and I am glad of it.â€™ He was to win the prize twice more, in 1930 and 1936.",

In 1878 she married Edward Knox, managing director of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. and later an administrator at the University of Sydney and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Five years later they moved into Rona in Bellevue Hill, which was destined to be home to five generations of the family. Ned and Edith Knox had four daughters. One of their granddaughters, Helen Rutledge, returned to live at Rona in 1978. In her family history, _My Grandfather's House_ (1986), she writes that pictures of her grandmother 'do not do her justice; in most of them she looks sad or stern â€¦ she did not smile much with her mouth, but she did with her lovely eyes'. Edith contributed to various charitable causes, including the Queen's Jubilee Fund and the 19th Battalion Comforts Fund. \\n\\nWilliam Beckwith (Bill) McInnes won the Archibald Prize seven times, writing in defence of his conservative work that 'in Australia we have not been bitten by Cubism or Futurism or other isms â€¦ and I am glad of it'.",

Returning to Sydney with a reputation as a financial expert, he joined the board of the Commercial Banking Company in 1885. After steering the company through the financial crises of the 1890s, he became its chairman of directors in 1901. He held this position for thirty-two years, during the last of which the bank weathered the Depression. From the late 1880s to the early 1930s, Cohen was also chairman of many other companies, including Australian Gas Light, United Insurance, Tooth and Co. and the Sydney Exchange. He and his wife Rebecca Levy amassed a significant collection of antiques and European paintings in their home, Engadine, in Onslow Avenue, Potts Point. He was a liberal, yet low-key, supporter of various charities, president of the Board of Management of the Great Synagogue for some fifteen years, and a lifelong advocate for the Jewish community.\\n\\nGeorge Lambert (1873-1930) painted George Judah Cohen on commission from the Commercial Banking Company, and entered the portrait in the Archibald Prize of 1925. Although it did not win, many commentators, notably Sydney Ure Smith (making a public statement on behalf of the Society of Artists) thought it â€˜immeasurably the bestâ€™ entry and preferred it to the winner, John Longstaffâ€™s portrait of a visiting Russian actor, Maurice Moscovich. Lambert won the Archibald Prize two years later with his portrait of Mrs Annie Murdoch.",

The daughter of a barrister, David Wilson QC, Betty made headlines when she married media proprietor Warwick Fairfax in 1928. Their divorce in 1946, and Betty's subsequent remarriage to a French naval officer, Commandant Pierre Gilly, were the subject of heated gossip. During the Second World War, Betty ran Air Force House in Sydney, where a team of volunteers provided meals and accommodation for 2000 servicemen each week. She has been described as 'one of the great beauties of her generation' who combined flair with wit and kindness. As a prominent socialite and hostess, Betty was connected with the city's primary tastemakers of the inter-war years. She later lived in Tokyo, Paris and London with Gilly, before returning to Sydney in the late 1980s. Betty's two children from her marriage to Warwick Fairfax, Caroline and James, both became art collectors and remarkable patrons of heritage and the arts in Sydney.\\n\\nDuring the 1920s, George Lambert's paintings dominated the Australian art scene. His elegant pencil drawing captures Betty at the age of about fourteen, and may have been drawn at her family home Yandooya in Bellevue Hill.",

He soon gained employment with the _Picturesque Atlas of Australia_, travelling a great deal to produce exactly the kind of illustration the publication required. In Sydney, he lived for a time at the artists' camp at Sirius Cove in Mosman along with Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and others. After getting to know cartoonist Livingston Hopkins, he developed his etching practice and began contributing to illustrated papers including the _Bulletin_, _Sydney Mail_, _Australian Town and Country Journal_ and the London _Graphic_. In 1899 he took his family by way of New York to London, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy and became friends with Bertram Mackennal and fellow members of the Chelsea Arts Club. He remained in London until World War One, during which he worked along with Roberts, Streeton and George Coates at the Wandsworth hospital before being sent to the Western Front as an official artist. About sixty of his evocative French watercolours are now in the Australian War Memorialâ€™s collection. \\n\\nGeorge Lambert left Australia in 1900 and lived in Paris briefly before settling in London, where he and Fullwood got to know each other well. The two are depicted beside each other in Coates' group portrait of ten painters who served as official war artists with the AIF. The title of Lambert's drawing of his friend, inscribed in a hand other than Lambert's along the bottom edge of the work, is thought to come from the way Fullwood signed his _Bulletin_ cartoons, though other sources state that he got the nickname Remus on account of his entertaining storytelling. In 1920 Fullwood returned to Sydney, where he continued to exhibit and involve himself in art societies including the Australian Painter Etchers' Society and the Australian Watercolour Institute. Lambert returned to Sydney in 1921, but died in 1930, aged just 56. At Lambert's request, Fullwood was one of his pallbearers. Fullwood himself died just a few months later.",

A year later, he had left school and was contributing two cartoons a week for the Christchurch satirical weekly the Spectator. He briefly attended business college while continuing to submit cartoons for various publications, raising the occasional objection from employers for the political tendencies of some of his works. While working for the Canterbury Times, he began sending examples of his work to a score of Australian editors each week â€“ a strategy which eventually landed him a job with the Bulletin, which brought him to Australia in 1911. He drew many caricatures, mainly of political figures, for the Bulletin and also contributed to the Lone Hand. A review of his drawings in 1915 stated: â€˜Mr Low is not in the least cruel â€¦ one might even say that at times his work approaches portraiture.â€™ In late 1916 he was exempted from war service on the basis that his work was of national importance. His second published anthology of caricatures, The Billy Book (1918) made his name, selling 60 000 copies and invoking the wrath of its subject, Prime Minister Billy Hughes, who is said to have torn the book up when given a copy by one of his ministers. The success of The Billy Book led to a contract with the London Star. Low left Australia in 1919 and remained in England, working for a number of publications until the end of his life in London. Knighted in 1962, he had two honorary doctorates and was posthumously described as the â€˜dominant cartoonist of the Western worldâ€™.\\n\\nLittle is known of Rudolph Buchner, a Sydney photographer, who interrupted his practice to serve in World War I but returned to the city afterwards. His sitters included Walter Burley Griffin, Louise Carbasse (later â€˜Louise Lovelyâ€™) and Mary Gilmore.",

Known for his graceful yet attacking style of play, Trumper played his first cricket in the inner-Sydney suburb of Surry Hills and at eighteen was selected for New South Wales. He made his Test debut at Nottingham in 1899, and during that first of four seasons in England established a reputation as a top batsman. On his second visit in 1902, Wisden described him as â€˜the best batsman in the worldâ€™. Trumper made 2570 runs in 35 matches for the Australian team, with eleven innings of over a hundred and the extraordinary average, given the terrible weather conditions, of 48. His career peaked in the 1910â€“1911 series against South Africa in Australia, when he scored 662 runs, averaging 94. He ended his first-class career with 255 matches, 16939 runs, 42 centuries and 87 half-centuries with an average of 44.58. The fair-haired and lithe- figured Trumper was equally admired off the field for his modesty, â€˜easiness of approach and suavity of mannerâ€™. Many thousands lined Sydneyâ€™s streets to farewell him after his death from a kidney disease at age thirty-seven.\\n\\nGeorge Beldam (1868â€“1937) played 142 matches for Middlesex, the MCC and London County, but is better known as a pioneer of action photography. Beldam dispensed with the staged, staid formula of earlier sports photographs and experimented instead with shutter speeds of up to one thousandth of a second to â€˜obtain accurately the stages in various strokesâ€™. Beldam and Charles Burgess Fry published two cricket manuals, Great bowlers and fielders, their methods at a glance (1907); and Great batsmen: their methods at a glance (1905), which featured this photograph of Trumper â€˜jumping out for a straight driveâ€™.",

In his best days, George Giffen was the best all round Australian player. His performances are splendid not only from a cricket point of view but as a very strong athlete. Giffenâ€™s fore and upper right arm is bigger than Jack Lyons who is both taller and considerably heavier than Giffen.\\n\\nTo advance in the game you must lead a good healthy life. Dr W. G. Grace is still a non-smoker. Avoid alcohol because it will tell on a playerâ€™s constitution sooner or later. When you are batting watch the ball very carefully, in fact never take your eyes off it.\\n\\nWhen playing in a match, keep in your mindâ€™s eye the exact position of every fieldsman. To learn fielding, join a baseball club.\\n\\nDo not copy any player but when you see him score four off a ball, try and score a four off that ball in the same direction but do it your own way for that will be the natural way for you.\\n\\nBe very particular not to let sport interfere with your work, for sport only lasts for a while and your work must keep you in comfort or otherwise just as you treat it.\\n\\nI think I have given you the ABC. Donâ€™t let sport worry you. If it does, give it up.",

                    "content": "Sir Douglas Mawson OBE FRS (1882â€“1958) was a geologist and Antarctic explorer. Born in Yorkshire, Mawson was two years old when his family emigrated to Australia and eventually settled in the inner Sydney suburb of Glebe. He was admitted to Sydney University at age sixteen, completing studies in mining engineering and geology there before taking up a position as lecturer in mineralogy and petrology at the University of Adelaide. Mawson made the first of his three journeys to Antarctica as physicist to Sir Ernest Shackletonâ€™s British Antarctic Expedition, conducted between 1907 and 1909. On that trip and with his mentor, geologist TW Edgeworth David, Mawson completed a dangerous 122-day sled journey and recorded observations at the South Magnetic Pole. Two years later, Mawson led his own expedition, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE) of 1911â€“14. Notable for its numerous scientific and geographical achievements, the AAE is equally legendary for Mawsonâ€™s survival during another epic sled journey to the South Pole that claimed the lives of his two companions. Mawson returned from the expedition a hero and was knighted. After serving with the British Ministry of Munitions and the Russian Military Commission during World War I, Mawson returned to Adelaide University, where he was Professor of Geology and Mineralogy for the remainder of his life. He revisited Antarctica as leader of the British, Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) of 1929â€“30 and 1930â€“31, a venture that later resulted in Australian control of almost six million square kilometres of the continent. In 1947, Mawson completed writing and editing the twenty-two volumes of reports on the scientific findings of the AAE. He retired from the University of Adelaide â€“ the geology building of which bears his name â€“ in 1952. He died six years later, survived by his wife and two daughters, and was honoured with a State funeral in Adelaide. Described by Edgeworth David as a man of â€˜infinite resource, splendid physique and astonishing indifference to frostâ€™, Mawson is counted among the twentieth centuryâ€™s most eminent explorers. \\n\\nThis photograph of Douglas Mawson in his early thirties was taken at a commercial photography studio in London during World War I. It was donated to the National Portrait Gallery by the subjectâ€™s daughter in 2000.",

My sledge crossed a crevasse obliquely and I called back to Ninnis,Â  to watch it, then went on, not thinking to look back again as it had no specially dangerous features. After a quarter of a mile I noted Mertz halt ahead and look enquiringly back. I looked behind and saw no sign of Ninnis and his team. I stopped and wondered, then bethought myself of the crevasse and hurried hack to find a great gaping hole in the ground. I called down but could get no answer. I signalled Mertz who was on skis ahead and he brought my team up to the scene. We hung over the edge but could see nothing nor get any answer. It was about 11 feet wide where broken through and straight ice-walled.\\n\\nBy hanging over on an alpine rope, we caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a food bag and one dog partially alive moaning, and part of another dog and dark object, apparently the tent, caught on a ledge. We sounded to the ledge with furlong line, 150 feet sheer, ice ledge. No sign of Ninnis â€“ must have struck it and been killed instantly, then gone on down. Our ropes not long enough to go down, or the sledge to span crevasse. Dog ceased to moan shortly. We called and sounded for three hours, then went on a few miles to a hill and took position observations. Came back, called and sounded for an hour.Â  Read the Burial Service.Â  Reviewed our position: practically all the food had gone down - spade, pick, tent, Mertz's Burberry trousers and helmet, cups, spoons, mast, sail etc. We had our sleeping bags, a week and a half food, the spare tent without poles, and our private bags and cooker and kerosene. The dogs in my team were very poorly and the worst, and no feed for them. We considered it a possibility to get through to Winter Quarters by eating dogs, so nine hours after the accident started back, but terribly handicapped.Â  May God Help us.",

Hurley became interested in photography as a teenager, acquiring his first camera at seventeen and a job with a Sydney postcard company before he turned twenty. He was twenty-five when he persuaded Douglas Mawson to take him on as the official photographer for the AAE (the British photographer, Herbert Ponting, had been Mawsonâ€™s first choice). Working in extreme conditions, Hurley took numerous photographs and the footage that was later released as the documentary Home of the Blizzard (1913). Hurley was also the official photographer for Ernest Shackletonâ€™s ill-fated British Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914â€“1917, during which he created the celebrated photographs of the expedition ship Endurance being slowly crushed in the polar ice. Hurley served as an official photographer during World War I, earning a reputation among the troops as â€˜the mad photographerâ€™ for the risks he took to get the perfect shot. His many photographs of battlefields in Belgium and France are now considered iconic, but were the cause of conflict with Australiaâ€™s official war historian, Charles Bean, who rejected Hurleyâ€™s method of forming single images from a composite of negatives. Hurley had great flair for showmanship and spent much of the period after the war presenting illustrated lectures and exhibitions of his photographs, making popular documentary and fiction films, and working for the newsreel company, Cinesound. Hurley made his third trip to Antarctica, again with Mawson, in the British, Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) of 1929â€“31, producing two films â€“ Southward Ho! with Mawson and Siege of the South â€“ as a result. He served with the AIF in the Middle East in World War II. In addition to his famous wartime and Antarctic work, Hurleyâ€™s career produced several documentaries and travelogues; two feature films; and numerous books about Australia and his travels.",

In 1888 he began painting with Tom Roberts, and later that year he moved to Melbourne. Conder, Roberts, and Arthur Streeton frequently painted together on the outskirts of Melbourne, forming the principal trio of the group of impressionist landscape artists known as the â€˜Heidelberg Schoolâ€™. The beachscape _A holiday at Mentone_ 1888 is Conderâ€™s great contribution to the group of paintings these artists created. In 1890 Conder went to study in Paris, where he moved in Bohemian circles, coming under the influence of Toulouse-Lautrec, who painted his portrait. His lasting fame derives from the paintings on silk, often in fan shapes, that he made in this period. He married the Canadian socialite and widow Stella Maris Belford (d. 1912) in Paris in 1901. Conder was stimulating company, and the coupleâ€™s London home was famous for its parties.",

In 1936 she came to Australia as a leading artist with the Monte Carlo Russian Ballet, sparkling in Petrouchka and Le Carnaval. She returned to England in 1937 but came back to Sydney early in 1938 to marry. In 1940 she began a ballet school in Sydney, and the following year she established the Kirsova Ballet, Australia's first professional ballet company. She was an important patron of Australian artists, composers and set designers, and took on some youngsters such as Peggy Sager who would later enjoy significant local careers. The Kirsova Ballet folded in 1944, but Kirsova kept her school running until she retired to Europe in the late 1940s.",

At eighteen Tossy became concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, but he resigned the following year. The Spivakovsky duo performed in a number of European countries before they teamed with cellist Edmund Kurtz in 1930. Three years later, the trio were to settle in Melbourne, where Tossy and Kurtz were both engaged to teach at the Conservatorium. In Melbourne Tossy was joined by his fiancÃ©e, philologist Dr Erika Lipsker-Zarden, who fled Germany in late 1934; they were married at the end of that year, and she taught Spanish at the University of Melbourne from 1936 to 1939. The trio performed regularly around the country and were often on the wireless; in March 1939 the brothers gave a concert to raise funds for European refugees on behalf of the Jewish Democratic Cultural League. In 1940 Tossy and Erika moved to the USA, where they lived for the rest of their lives, Tossy appearing as a soloist with major orchestras and teaching for fifteen years at Juillard. He played a 1721 Stradivarius, and his idiosyncratic technique gave rise to the book _The Spivakovsky Way of Bowing_ by Gaylord Jost.",

It was his sculpture that won him the 1925 Travelling Art Scholarship, which he spent most profitably in Italy. Later, his chief mentor was George Lambert (1873â€“1930), whom he assisted in Sydney from 1927 to 1930. At that time, Lambert was weakened by remnant malaria, and he greatly valued Murch's strength, calling him the 'pocket Hercules'. They worked together on the figure for the tomb of the unknown soldier in St Maryâ€™s Cathedral, and Murch completed the Henry Lawson Memorial after Lambert died in 1930. In 1941 Murch won the competition to execute the memorial relief in honour of Dame Nellie Melba in the Sydney Town Hall. Perhaps because he had trained as an engineer, Murch sculpted in all sorts of materials including fibreglass, rubber, pottery and cement â€“ the latter when restoring Norman Lindsay's garden sculptures. A foundation member of the Australian Academy of Art, Murch won the Society of Artists' Medal in 1935 and the Archibald Prize for 1949. \\n\\nIt is thought that this photograph may have been in George Lambert's studio when he died, and that Arthur Murch, who continued to work in the studio, may have taken it as a souvenir of his friend.",

Leaving school at thirteen, he worked as a clerk and then, for two years, as a boundary rider. At the age of twenty-two he settled permanently in London, where he began writing to support himself, contributing pieces to local magazines and writing London letters for the Bulletin. In 1888, Chambersâ€™s reputation was established when his play Captain Swift was staged with Herbert Tree in the lead role. The play about a bushranger grabbed by â€˜the long arm of coincidenceâ€™ was to be his only Australian-themed work apart from Thumb-nail sketches of Australian life (1891). For three decades he worked on twenty or so plays, which were staged in the West End and sometimes in New York; his outstanding successes included The fatal card (1894), The tyranny of tears (1899), Passers-by (1911) and The saving grace (1917). Handsome, graceful and a scintillating conversationalist, he was courted by society hostesses and prominent in club life. Although he was amicably married, between 1896 and 1904 he was Nellie Melbaâ€™s lover. His second wife, actress Pepita Bobadilla, later married Sidney Reilly, â€˜Ace of Spiesâ€™.\\n\\nRalph Barton (1891â€“1931) New Yorker and Vanity Fair cartoonist, drew some of the defining images of American high life of the 1920s, including the illustrations for the novel Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and its successor, But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes. His portrait subjects included Charlie Chaplin, Ernest Hemingway, Sigmund Freud and Lillian Gish. Cursed with depression, Barton suicided in his Manhattan penthouse at thirty-nine.",

Over twelve months, he and his comedienne wife became wealthy and famous. They returned overseas, but in 1879 they arrived in Australia having purchased from WS Gilbert the exclusive Australasian rights to perform HMS Pinafore. In 1880 Williamson formed his (Royal) Comic Opera Company. Initially sole lessee of the Theatre Royal in Melbourne, he was in and out of partnerships from 1882, mounting increasingly lavish productions with international stars, opening new ventures such as the (New) Princessâ€™s Theatre in Melbourne, and refurbishing or leasing other venues such as Her Majestyâ€™s in Sydney. By 1904, he had 650 employees on his payroll. Having made an unrivalled impact on Australian theatre, Williamson died in Paris, and was buried in Chicago. \\n\\nSir John Longstaff (1861â€“1941), born in Clunes, Victoria, studied at the National Gallery School in Melbourne from 1883 to 1887 and thenceforth at Cormanâ€™s in Paris. Becoming friends with the Australian expatriate impressionist John Russell, he met Toulouse- Lautrec and others, but his own style remained conservative and he exhibited at the Salon and the Royal Academy in the early 1890s. His personal attractiveness and charm gained him easy access to wealthy society, where he found portrait sitters including King Edward and Queen Alexandra. Longstaff painted Williamson in his St Johnâ€™s Wood studio at about the same time as he painted portraits of Williamsonâ€™s daughters, Marjory and AimÃ©e (known as Tootles). Having painted his commanding portrait of Nellie Melba in 1923, he won the Archibald Prize five times between 1925 and 1935; during this period, in 1928, he was knighted. From 1927 until his death in Melbourne in 1941 he was a trustee of the National Gallery of Victoria.",

Born Florence Wilson, she studied at the Conservatorium of Music and the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1919. On arriving in London, she, like her compatriot Nellie Melba, adopted a name honouring her homeland and as Florence Austral debuted in the role of BrÃ¼nnhilde in Wagner's _Die WalkÃ¼re_ at Covent Garden in 1922. During the 1920s and 1930s she toured North America and Australia and made the first of many recordings. The quality and power of her voice lent itself to the Wagnerian roles that secured her reputation, but she also performed in operas by Verdi, Mozart and Puccini. By the end of the 1930s, Austral was increasingly afflicted by multiple sclerosis. With her husband, flautist John Amadio, she returned to Australia after the war and in the 1950s took up a teaching position at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music in Newcastle. She was admitted to an aged care facility in the early 1960s. \\n\\nHoward Barron was a renowned portraitist, whose commissions included Sir Winston Churchill, Queen Elizabeth II and Dame Nellie Melba. This portrait of Austral is likely to have been painted when the diva toured Australia in 1930. Barron's portrait presents a clear statement about Austral's success, portraying her as a confident woman in a theatrical pose.",

She studied with the actor-manager Duncan Macdougall, who had established Sydneyâ€™s Playbox Society in 1923. At the Playbox Theatre on Rowe Street in 1925, Desmond appeared in the leading role in Zolaâ€™s Therese Raquin. Through the Playbox, she met the English-born actor Teddy Howell, whom she married after acting for a year in Hobart. Desmondâ€™s stage career burgeoned in the early 1930s with performances in The Seagull, Hedda Gabler and Othello for the Playbox and Independent Theatres, and later for the Experimental Theatre, of which she was co-director with Howell. However, by 1936 Desmond and Howell were household names through their starring roles in Fred and Maggie Everybody, which first aired on ABC radio in 1932. Written and produced by the couple, it became Australiaâ€™s longest-running comedy radio series, broadcast on more than 50 stations at its peak. Desmond appeared in many other plays and drama series, among them Coronets of England (1937â€“1943). During the 1940s and 1950s she was involved in production of radio programs including Hesterâ€™s Diary and Dr Paul, which aired for 22 years. In 1947, with Howell and their daughter, Madeleine, she was a founding member of the Radio Players.\\n\\nThis portrait of the young Therese Desmond is by her grandfather, with whom she emigrated.",

Born in Bundaberg, she was the daughter of a Mauritian circus artist and his Australian wife, but was adopted in 1901 by Mary â€˜Marizlesâ€™ Wirth, of the famous Wirth Brothersâ€™ Circus troupe. May had been introduced to acrobatics, tightrope walking and other tricks by her father, and her adoptive family soon added equestrian stunts to her repertoire. After a star turn with Wirth Brothersâ€™ Circus in Sydney in 1911, Marizles took May to the USA, where she was signed for two seasons with Barnum & Bailey. She made her American debut at Madison Square Garden in 1912, and later performed in the UK and Europe with Marizles and her step-sister, Stella. As the â€˜Royal Wirth Familyâ€™ the trio featured alongside other dazzling international artistes in Wirth Brothersâ€™ 1915â€“1916 Australasian tour. One report described a stunt wherein May somersaulted from the back of one horse to another galloping behind it, â€˜thereby earning salvos of applause from the big audience presentâ€™. Returning to America in 1917, the â€˜Wizard Riderâ€™ again headlined with Barnum & Bailey, remaining the star equestrienne attraction until she left the company in the late-1920s. Later in life, she resided in Sarasota, Florida, and was inducted into the Circus Hall of Fame there in 1964.",

Having toured Australia to raise the means to study abroad, she went to Paris to train with Madame Mathilde Marchesi, Melbaâ€™s teacher, and later studied with Jacques Bouhy. She made her London debut in November 1901, appearing with Clara Butt and compatriot Ada Crossley, and then returned to Australia under contract to JC Williamson & Co. Castles performed in Britain and Europe throughout the first decade of the century, touring Australia again for J & N Tait in 1909â€“1910 before, in 1912, being offered a four-year contract with the Imperial Opera in Vienna. She was forced to return to Australia on the outbreak of war; and in 1917 went to the United States, remaining there for two years during which period she appeared at Carnegie Hall and gave concerts for convalescent and returned servicemen. Back in Australia from 1919, she went into semi-retirement. Castles never married. She died in Melbourne in 1951.",

Born Fanny Jane Davis in Christchurch, New Zealand, she was raised in Melbourne, where she began singing operetta in 1897. In 1902 she went to Paris to study with Mathilde Marchesi, Nellie Melba's teacher, who gave her the name Alda. She made her European debut in 1904, and by 1908 she had appeared at the Monnaie, Brussels, Covent Garden and La Scala. That year she became a member of New York's Metropolitan Opera, staying with the company for 21 years. Noted especially for her lyrical roles, she enjoyed a successful recording career, making her debut with Enrico Caruso, who claimed that his voice and hers blended perfectly: 'I have never found that with any other woman singer.' Alda toured Australia and New Zealand in 1927, by which time she had reportedly come to 'disdain' Australia. Her colourful memoir, _Men, Women and Tenors_, was published in 1937. She died while on holiday in Venice, Italy.\\n\\nThis dramatic photo portrait of Alda was taken in New York in 1918 by the Metropolitan Opera's principal photographer, Herman Mishkin. From 1910 to 1932 Mishkin was the Met's photographer of choice, in the early years persuading operatic set painters to supply him with artful studio backdrops like this one.",

With Caruso, Amato, Didur and Madam Homer.â€™\\n\\nThat was how the papers announced my debut.\\n\\nNot that Gilda and I were new to each other. I had sung the role of the hunchbackâ€™s daughter many times â€“ at La Monnaie in Brussels, at Convent Garden (also with Caruso â€“ strange prophecy), in Warsaw, in Buenos Aires, and â€“ highest honour of them all â€“ in Parma, at the annual Verdi festival.\\n\\nBut what set this performance apart from all others before and after it, was that the Metropolitan and I were meeting for the first time. I hadnâ€™t the ghost of an idea of it then, but in the 22 years ahead of me its draughty stage was to become as familiar as my own drawing room. Its affairs, from the chronic toothache of the eldest stagehand and the squeaky high note of the trombone player to the weakness of certain of its trustees for certain types of singers and _premiere danseuses_, were to form my horizon. All the feuds, jealousies, successes, failures, envies, ambitions and despairs that can breed in the fertile soil of the worldâ€™s biggest company of operatic temperaments were to season my daily life with joy, tragedy, bitterness or humour.",

Having spent a year in Sydney, where he made carved furniture for the NSW Forestry Commissionâ€™s contribution to the 1893 Chicago Exhibition, Parker left for London. He studied sculpture at the City and Guilds of London Technical Art School and worked as an assistant to a number of prominent practitioners. A regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy from 1903, Parker produced sculptures of classical and mythological figures in marble and bronze as well as memorial sculpture, portrait busts and reliefs. His Ariadne was acquired for the Tate in 1908; and he was awarded medals for the sculptures he exhibited in the Paris Salons of 1908 and 1910. In 1915, he started work on his most significant public commission â€“ the large sculptures Prosperity and The Awakening of Australia for the entrance to Australia House in London, which were completed in 1918. In 1930, Parker returned permanently to Australia with his wife, Janet, whom he had married in London in 1911. He held solo exhibitions of his sculptures and watercolours in Sydney and Melbourne in the early thirties, and in 1938, his works The Pioneer and Eve repentant were exhibited in the sesquicentenary â€˜All Australian Art Exhibitionâ€™ at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Though relatively few of Parkerâ€™s works were acquired by Australian institutions during his lifetime, examples now reside in collections such as that of the University of Queensland, which also holds his personal papers. This miniature is believed to have been painted by Bessie Gibson (1868â€“1961), an Australian painter who, like Parker, grew up in Brisbane but lived and worked abroad for many years. Born in Ipswich, Gibson studied art at Brisbane Technical College and in 1905 left Australia for further study in Europe. She ended up staying for more than forty years, exhibiting regularly at the SociÃ©tÃ© des Artistes FranÃ§ais and the Salon dâ€™Automnes in Paris, where she lived, and at the Royal Academy. \\n\\nOne of a small group of Australian women artists, including Bess Norriss Tait, associated with the brief re- emergence of the portrait miniature in the early twentieth century, Gibsonâ€™s output also included formal portrait commissions, landscapes, interiors and still life. She returned to Australia after World War II and continued exhibiting during the 1950s and 60s. The Queensland Art Gallery staged A Tribute to Bessie Gibson in 1958.",

Goodsir set her sights on England and France, venturing overseas to 'find herself' at the mature age of 36. Her works were featured in the seasonal salons of Paris, gaining her significant attention and resulting in a steady flow of commissions. After briefly moving to London (where she also exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Royal Institute) she resettled in Paris in 1921 with her companion and muse, Rachel Dunn, who appeared in many of her paintings. In 1926, she was made a member of Franceâ€™s SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des Beaux Arts, one of few Australians to receive the honour. \\n\\nThis 1900 self portrait, made in her first year in Paris, shows why she generated noted interest within the Parisian art world. Goodsir, using herself as subject, has successfully captured the balance between the aesthetic and the authentic, offering a portrayal that presents the artist as a sensitive and confident woman, with a decent dose of appealing Romantic drama. On her brief return to Australia in 1927 to deliver two major solo exhibitions, her reputation as a portrait artist in Europe was widely vaunted by the press.",

A few weeks after the end of World War 1 she took up the opportunity to visit the battlefields of France with her father, who was attached to the New Zealand War Graves Commission. Thus, she became the first Australian female artist to depict the devastated battlefields, towns and churches of the western front. Chapman remained overseas with her father, an organist who played in Dieppe, Venice and elsewhere, and married a brilliant organist, George Thalben-Ball, herself. After she married, she gave up painting, but she encouraged her daughter, Pamela, to pursue art. For the rest of her life, Chapman lived in England, only returning to Australia for a visit in 1960. The Art Gallery of New South Wales has her 1911 portrait of Dattilo Rubbo and a number of her paintings of France, Belgium and England. The Australian War Memorial, too, has several of her evocative French scenes.",

She began studying under Margaret Preston at the School of Design around 1910. Following her motherâ€™s death in 1913, Bowen decided to leave Adelaide â€“ a place she later described as â€˜a queer little backwater of intellectual timidityâ€™ â€“ and pursue a career as an artist in Europe. She arrived in London in 1914, later enrolling at the Westminster School of Art and becoming part of a circle of artists and writers that included TS Eliot, Ezra Pound and WB Yeats. She met the English novelist Ford Madox Ford in 1917 and began a relationship with him that lasted nine years during which her own work was often accorded second place to Fordâ€™s. Their daughter, Julia, was born in 1920. In France from 1922, Bowen painted landscapes and portraits of friends and family, becoming dependent on her painting for an income when her relationship with Ford ended. Bowen travelled to the USA in 1932, completing a number of portrait commissions there before returning to Europe and spending the remainder of the decade eking out a living with painting, reviewing and teaching in England and France. Her memoir, Drawn from life, appeared in 1941. In 1944, she became the second woman appointed an official war artist and was tasked with depicting the activities of the RAAF in England and the return of prisoners of war from Germany. In this role, Bowen produced a total of forty-six works, including Bomber Crew (1944), a group portrait completed from sketches she made prior to the seven-strong crewâ€™s departure on a mission from which six men did not return. Her last commission as a war artist was a depiction of George VI saluting troops on Victory Day in London in 1946. Bowen was gravely ill with cancer when she completed the painting in 1947. Wishing to return to Australia but lacking her fare, she sought, unsuccessfully, to be repatriated on a troop ship. Bowen died in England in October 1947.",

He first caught sight of Jeanne Heloise Morel in a Paris art school where she studied and modelled. They married in 1902; he was to paint and draw her until 1929, when she suffered a stroke. In 1901-02 he painted a superbly commanding portrait of Dame Nellie Melba, acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria in 1980. After he returned to live in Melbourne in 1933, a sad widower, he engaged only desultorily with local art politics, turning instead to composing music. In 1946 the NGV held a full retrospective of his work; the same institution mounted another touring retrospective in 1991.",

By that time, they had two children; they would have three more. In 1954 a review of a group exhibition singled Smithâ€™s work out for praise: â€˜Eric Smithâ€™s _Industrial Landscape_ compels our attention by the controlled violence of its colour, and by a mysticism that sees cathedrals in factories and crosses in telegraph poles . . Mr Smith conveys the impression that he sees these forms as a modern Golgotha â€“ harrowing, portentous yet part of our everyday world.â€™ _The painter transmogrified and Mrs Smith_ hints at what itâ€™s like for a commonsensical person to live with a co-parent who sees things this way, and is compelled to realise his vision even if it means setting up paints and easel in the bedroom. By the time he painted this work the artist had won the Blake Prize for religious art six times, and the Sulman Prize for a â€˜subject paintingâ€™ or a â€˜genre paintingâ€™ once. At once a painterâ€™s exercise in different ways of portraying personality, a wry reflection on relationships, and Eric Smithâ€™s tribute to his wifeâ€™s stability, _The painter transmogrified and Mrs Smith_ won him his second Sulman Prize.\\n\\n ****",

Some painters do a great many drawings before they tackle the major work, but I usually go straight to the canvas or the Masonite panel. I have no real reason; I cannot explain why it seems necessary for me to get straight to the board, but Iâ€™ve always found it so. Iâ€™ve many times said to myself that I was going to do a lot of drawings, but I no sooner start than I move across to the prepared board.\\n\\nSometimes I have a particular subject in mind, religious or otherwise, but most often than not I just start painting. This seems necessary for me, to just let the thing grow, to really try and find out about myself, let the thing happen, and as the forms appear on the canvas they suggest something to me, something perhaps to do with a subject matter, and if the forms seem dynamic enough, things are working and exciting level and I push that thing on to a particular subject matter.\\n\\nIt is so hard today, we have nothing to hang our hat onto, and itâ€™s a case of really digging down deep to find out about yourself. You take a risk here that you wonâ€™t be understood.\\n\\nI have always been concerned with the human condition, whether the tragedy or aspirations of man. And everywhere new relationships are springing up which must be felt and explored, and in this way, I must create my own language to express the depth of my feelings about these things.",

Afterwards, he studied painting at RMIT and began to exhibit regularly. In 1952 he moved to Sydney, where he emerged as a key exponent of abstraction. He was later a member of the group called the Sydney Nine, whose 1961 exhibitions asserted the rigour of abstract art in the context of debates about its integrity. Smith won the Archibald Prize for a third time with this portrait of his friend Peter Sculthorpe (1929â€“2014), the Tasmanian-born, internationally renowned composer. Inspired by Sculthorpe's music, Smith conceived of an expressive portrait to evoke the composer's creative process and started work on the painting less than three weeks before entries closed. A day before the deadline, he made drastic changes to the work, covering everything other than Sculthorpe's figure in thick orange paint. Squares of white were 'slashed' across the canvas, creating 'sheets of music exploding into the space'. Sculthorpe had the portrait on loan for a long time before the National Portrait Gallery purchased it from Smith in 2004. 'Most portraits by other artists tended to be rather dark and expressionistic,' Sculthorpe said in 2008, 'whereas Eric's painting brings in the sun â€¦ It captures my heart, my soul, my spirit, my music, everything.'",

When I listen to music I only hear it with my heart. Of course, it goes through the ears and the brain and so on and so on, but if it moves me, well, thatâ€™s all. I donâ€™t want to analyse it. Of course, one has to for students and so on but thatâ€™s irrelevant, I just want to soak it in. And that is all, surely, that music is about. And so everything that I write comes from my feelings or my experience of life and of living.\\n\\nItâ€™s getting started that is the difficulty, and almost always I get started through some, well, feeling in my heart, that sounds vague but it means something to me anyway, or something that I see, even something that I smell, but rarely anything that I hear, oddly enough. Once Iâ€™ve got started, Iâ€™m right. And I am a slow worker, but then to be a composer itâ€™s just sheer hard work.\\n\\nYou have to forget technique or else you maybe just get beyond it, in a sense be as a kind of sieve, although I donâ€™t believe in spiritualism, shall we say, Iâ€™ll use the word medium, in that it comes through you in some way. Because if I am being occupied with the technique, somehow the message just will not get across or the heart thing. Itâ€™s very hard to explain, and this is why I canâ€™t really talk about method.\\n\\nI suppose I have lots of little secrets and I suppose that this is why my music always sounds like me, because it has the same faults and the same virtues, if any, whatever kind of piece it may happen to be. This is something that I try to get across to my students, theyâ€™ve just got to write and write and write until they can handle notes and juggle them about, and then just forget all about it and abandon themselves to being what they are.",

The portrait is in oil on canvas and measures about 1.5m tall by 2m wide in its frame. The frame consists of an inner white timber border and an outer border in pale peach.\\n\\nThe portrait is dominated by its vibrant orange-ochre coloured background in chalky, textured paint, with patches of saturated blue, red and yellow scattered across the canvas. \\n\\nPeter is seated at a piano on the far left, side on, his face looking to the right of the scene. Sheets of music and bright squares of colour seem to emanate from his hands and the keyboard. Peter is painted realistically, however the brushwork is uneven, as if applied quickly and spontaneously, conveying energy and movement.\\n\\nPeter is surrounded by an irregular halo of yellow paint. His thick hair, eyebrows and short moustache are dark, streaked with red, yellow and blue. His skin glows yellow and orange, highlighted with white. He wears a serious expression, dark eyes looking straight ahead at the loose pages of music, mouth closed. \\n\\nHis shirt is a bright cobalt blue, flecked with red and yellow, the collar undone and sleeves rolled up. Peterâ€™s left elbow is bent up, parallel with his shoulder. His forearm is raised, his fingers touching the explosion of sheet music in front of him. \\n\\nThe pages are large white rectangles in different sizes, with bars and notes scratched roughly into their surfaces. Other rectangular forms in red, blue and yellow overlay and mix with them in a haphazard mass. Further rectangles splay across the right of the portrait culminating with a large red square in the top right corner of the work.  \\nPeterâ€™s right arm is lowered, bent at the elbow, fingers stretched over the keyboard. Dashes of paint radiate from his fingertips where they connect with the piano keys.\\n\\nSeated on a piano stool, Peterâ€™s right upper leg, in pale cream-yellow trousers, disappears beneath the keyboard. This area of the portrait, along the lower edge, is suggested with minimal outlines.\\n\\nIn the lower right portion of the portrait, in small red letters, the artist has signed: Eric Smith â€˜82.\\n\\nWritten and voiced by Lucie Shawcross",

He began designing backdrops and costumes during the early 1940s, earning his first professional commission in 1947. Awarded a British Council Scholarship in 1950, he moved to London, subsequently working there and in Australia over the next four decades on more than 140 ballet, opera and theatre productions. In the 1960s, he developed a close association with The Australian Ballet, creating designs for productions including _Coppelia_ (1960), _Giselle_ (1965) and _Sleeping Beauty_ (1973). In the 1970s, he created the sets and costumes for the ballets of Peter Sculthorpe's _Sun Music_ and _Rites of Passage_, choreographed by Robert Helpmann. At the same time, Rowell developed a considerable reputation as an artist, producing expressionist paintings, mixed media works and sculpture inspired by the Australian landscape. The National Gallery of Australia holds more than 400 examples of his costume design drawings; and in 1999, Opera Australia mounted the retrospective exhibition _Double Act_.\\n\\nDavid Strachan was a Sydney painter who spent much of his working life in Europe.

Quite simply I was stagestruck and for a long time thatâ€™s really all I wanted to do, I just wanted to work in the theatre, I was mad about the theatre. That seemed enough for a few years, or perhaps for ten years, and then I became terribly conscious of the fact that I was working in a medium that you can never be wholly in charge of as a designer or a producer or a choreographer; youâ€™re one of a number of collaborators working together on a production. And I became more and more interested in the idea of painting because that seemed to me to be something where I could be in charge of a medium and express myself in a way that, much as I love working in the theatre, I would never have that final control about what the statement was. So I started to try and paint and I worked terribly hard. I took myself out of the theatre because I could see that the only way of developing a technique and trying to find a direction as a painter was really to get right out of the theatre for a few years. I did that, and people in the English theatre thought I was mad, but I felt it was something I absolutely had to do.\\n\\nThe paintings I did for the first few years were really not good at all. But I worked very hard, I developed a technique. I simply work in the theatre when Iâ€™m offered work that I want to do and when Iâ€™m not doing that, Iâ€™m up in the studio painting for all Iâ€™m worth.\\n\\nI know that this work I do as a painter nourishes all my theatre work, the colours even that Iâ€™ve used in the _Sleeping Beauty_ which are very â€“ particularly in the prologue and scenes like that â€“ absolutely strong, chromatic colours I know I donâ€™t see in other theatre. I can only use these because of all Iâ€™ve learned as a painter. Anyway, the thing is that both forms of activity now are absolutely necessary to me. People donâ€™t particularly want you to work in two different media but itâ€™s something that I absolutely need.",

Establishing a medical practice in Melbourne, he began to paint with no formal training. After falling in with a group including Arthur Boyd, Charles Blackman, John Perceval, Leonard French, Fred Williams and Clifton Pugh he abandoned medicine for a time to concentrate on his art. Between 1962 and 1988 he held a number of solo exhibitions, mostly of seascapes, that drew admiration from critics including Patrick McCaughey. Hattam and his wife Kate acquired many works by artists in their circle and beyond. Credited as the first private collectors to embrace Fred Williams's art wholeheartedly, they built up a substantial group of his paintings from 1958 onward.",

Larter has also made a significant body of geometric, ethereal and glittery abstract paintings, elements of which have often filled the backgrounds of the figurative works. This painting, featuring an intricate hypodermic syringe technique originally inspired by Arabic calligraphy, contains many of the elements characteristic of Larter's figurative and abstract work.",

But I found that when I wanted to draw the body, the drawing deteriorated in quality the further away from the head you got. So I decided that I would draw nudes and improve my technique.\\n\\nI started drawing nudes, using my wife as a model. At this time I was painting abstract pictures, I was virtually doing sort of a private record of my wife â€“ well she was 17 when I married her and you get sort of gradual change from girlhood to womanhood, sort of thing â€“ and I was sort of creating this private record. After a while I became quite good at this and I thought, well I can use this in my paintings.\\n\\nI find that Iâ€™ll draw anybody in the nude if theyâ€™ll pose, sort of thing. I enjoy drawing nudes. Then thereâ€™s the perverse side of it â€“ I know that they upset people, they upset my mother and she was the first person to be upset. Then as I started to exhibit and send pictures away, people started writing things and saying things about the nudes. I think this made me a little more daring, so instead of being discreet nudes they became very indiscreet nudes. I suppose you say, a Larter nude, you expect to see all the main sexual characteristics. Well fair enough, give a dog a bad name and heâ€™ll live up to it. Iâ€™ve certainly done this, Iâ€™ve made it more and more and more obvious, I suppose. But I have such strange people asking me â€¦ I can remember being at an opening where a funny little solicitor was introduced to me and his whole idea of talking to me was that he thought that if he kept with me long enough eventually weâ€™d get to the girls and heâ€™d have a fine time. I suppose this does sort of produce this sort of reaction in some people. But to me this isnâ€™t the point of doing the work.",

                    "transcript": "Self-portrait with pin-up by Richard Larter was made in 1965. It measures about 125 cm high by 80 cm wide in a narrow plain wood frame. Larter used synthetic polymer paint and alkyd resin on composition board. He applied the paint using a syringe, squirting out short, fine, irregular lines. This technique gives the painting a distinctive drawn style and bumpy surface. Larter depicts himself standing with an image of Robert Menzies behind his shoulder.\\n\\nThe background is painted a pale brown-grey buff with the occasional smear of white and several bright blotches of vibrant red and yellow.\\n\\nRobert Menziesâ€™ face takes up the top left corner of the painting. It is surrounded by a thin black border drawn along its upper, right, and lower edges, while the left edge abuts the portraitâ€™s frame. Menzies is a sparse black outline shaded with minimal cross hatching. His hair is short and neat, and his eyebrows are large and dark. Menziesâ€™ eyes look down and the corners of his thin mouth are also downturned. The image is cropped just below his chin.\\n\\nTo the right of the Menzies image is a blot of saturated red seeping down the portrait. The same colour also emerges as a dome shape on the lower left edge. Additionally, there are two smaller patches of yellow. One, the bottom quarter of a circle, is positioned beneath Menzies and against the left side of the portrait. The other, a yellow half circle, peeps out on the opposite side of the canvas, a bit higher up. On the left bottom edge of the portrait is an ambiguous object with a pointed asymmetrical tip, which rounds out and down like a jug. It is intricately patterned with fine blue lines and is inscribed near its top: RL65. \\n\\nLarter stands in the right foreground, his shoulder obscuring part of Menziesâ€™ jowl. His head is much smaller than Menzies' and his brown, orange, and yellow-flecked hair is in line with Menziesâ€™ brow. Larterâ€™s skin is made from layers of tadpole-shaped lines in yellow, orange, red, pink, and green. The small lines swirl together over Larterâ€™s face in waves across his brow, following the contours around his eyes and nose, and circling his cheeks and chin. Larter has dark slender eyebrows, angling from their inner points downwards. His eyes are blue and look to his right towards Menzies. Larter's mouth is thin and pursed.\\n\\nLarter wears a collared shirt with a blue, striped, grid pattern, and faint patches of yellow. His tie is orange with small dashes of green. His bulky brown jacket is secured by three buttons, its entire surface richly textured with non-uniform vertical lines in browns and grey. Larter's arm on the left of the image extends diagonally down and out. His hand makes a fist with the thumb on the outside. It is directly above, but at some distance from, the ambiguous, blue-patterned object. His other arm hangs down against his body; his hand loosely closed with forefinger just touching the thumb.\\n\\nBeneath his coat, Larterâ€™s legs stand apart. He wears wide, blue trousers, one side of each a darker blue, giving the impression of a crease down their fronts. Larter's legs are cropped just below the knee, by the lower edge of the portrait.\\n\\n**Audio description written and voiced by Lucie Shawcross, 2021**",

After studying in London, she returned with her husband to Australia in 1960 and set up a studio in Paddington. In 1973, with fibre artist Mona Hessing, Gazzard was one of the first craftspeople invited to exhibit at the National Gallery of Victoria. The exhibition, _Clay + Fibre_, generated much discussion about whether craft was art and accelerated acceptance of women artists. Through the 1970s and 1980s she exhibited large abstract works in a number of important group shows and solo exhibitions. Gazzard was also instrumental in the development of craft in Australia, including helping to set up the Crafts Council of Australia in 1971 and chairing the Crafts Board of the Australia Council in 1973. President of the World Crafts Council from 1980 to 1984, Gazzard was commissioned to create the bronze sculpture _Mingarri: The Little Olgas_ (1988), which stands in the central Executive Courtyard of Parliament House, Canberra. The Art Gallery of New South Wales acquired her last major work, _Selini I_ (2009), in 2012.\\n\\nArtist Judy Cassab owned a 1966 work by Gazzard, _Dial_. It has been suggested that it was perhaps exchanged for this portrait of Gazzard that Cassab painted in the same year.",

                    "transcript": "I think the thing that really concerns me is form. Sometimes Iâ€™m asked where I get my ideas from and itâ€™s hard to say, sometimes it might be sitting in a movie, just a certain shape flicks across the screen and I think â€˜Thatâ€™s just what Iâ€™m looking forâ€™, or on a beach a piece of driftwood, or in the park a squashed fig. Anything can supply it when youâ€™re looking, when youâ€™re feeling the need for a new idea.\\n\\nIâ€™d say that the curve is the thing that interests me, seldom the straight line in an object. Iâ€™m very sensitive to curves, a wrong curve can ruin it from the first half-inch. If I know itâ€™s somehow not going to be right, I just break it up. I break up a lot of things; in fact in my studio at the moment I can see six or eight things that I will no doubt smash up. Perhaps itâ€™s the scale thatâ€™s important in what I do. I keep being dissatisfied with small things, though they can be fun to do at times. I want to do bigger, more massive objects.\\n\\nI never feel so happy as when Iâ€™m quietly working alone. And I have everything here to make my work, the kiln, all. An artist has to be very close to his work. I know when Iâ€™ve been looking in museums, Iâ€™ve often felt that Iâ€™ve known the person whoâ€™s made that object. Perhaps this doing of oneâ€™s own work, oneâ€™s own thing, perhaps this is the link between civilisations. Other civilisations have tried to leave us what they knew. Perhaps this is what itâ€™s about.",

As non-Indigenous people arrived and remained in the area he became an important negotiator for the Yolngu. In the late 1940s, Marika contributed to a set of 365 crayon drawings made for anthropologists Ronald and Catherine Berndt. During the 1950s, he encouraged the commercial production of bark paintings, hoping to promote understanding of Yolgnu spiritual beliefs and traditions, and painted large bark works for the Art Gallery of New South Wales. He contributed to the Yirrkala church panels, and was instrumental in sending the bark petition to Canberra that has since become a key document in the history of Aboriginal land rights legislation. Marika was one of the first Indigenous artists to teach his daughters (Banduk and Dhuwarrwarr) to paint and his son, Wandjuk, was a highly influential Indigenous spokesperson and artist.\\n\\nDuring a visit to Avalon Public School in Sydney in the early 1960s, Marika met the painter and sculptor Arthur Murch, who was teaching art to the children. Murch painted this poignant unfinished portrait of the artist in his unique style, depicting Australian people and landscape using Renaissance techniques.",

She began her training in art in 1910 in Sydney, and then spent two years studying in England. In 1915 Cossington Smith' work _The sock knitter_, considered to be the first post-impressionist work painted in Australia, was included in the Royal Art Society exhibition. In the late 1920s, she began work on her now celebrated series of paintings of the Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction. Following the deaths of her parents in the 1930s, Cossington Smith moved from her garden studio at her family home in Turramurra and into the main house and began to focus on intimate paintings of interiors, in which she expressed forms with colour and light. Her contribution to Australian art went largely unrecognised until, at age 81, she was honoured with a retrospective exhibition, which opened at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1973 and toured to state galleries.\\n\\nPainted in 1948, Cossington Smith's self-portrait represents her vibrant use of light-infused colour and interest in structure and form. Depicting herself in the prime of her long career, the short brushstrokes, laden with paint, build up a strong colour portrait and capture the dedication she felt towards her art in her intense focused gaze and the determined set of her lips.",

I used to be very fond of the bush but now I canâ€™t manage to go out in the bush.\\n\\nThe large painting which I have in the Wills art prize competition is an interior. Itâ€™s a room with a wardrobe and a bed and a carpet but the chief thing to me was the yellow walls, so that is why I call it _Interior in Yellow_. It was a very exciting thing to do. I wanted to express the forms in colour with the light because the whole thing is meant to express an interior with the light.\\n\\nI use squares in the way I paint, not from a conscious way but it came to me naturally because I feel in that way that light can be put into the colour. whereas just to put colour on to the surface in a flat way, I feel that it gives it a dead look.\\n\\nThe room is in my own home here and the sunlight did not come in in a definite way but the whole room seemed to be full of light, which is what I want to do more than the actual sunlight. I feel that even the shadows are a subdued light and they must have light in them as well as the light parts.",

                    "transcript": "This self-portrait of the painter Grace Cossington Smith, was made in 1948, with oil on cardboard, and measures 57cm high and 48cm wide. The prominent frame is dark wood, and between it and the painting is a second, narrow, inner frame of bone coloured canvas.\\n\\nThe dynamism in this portrait comes from the way it has been painted - with small, squarish, paint-laden brush strokes in warm yellows and browns, that seem to flicker and move â€“ dancing across the surface of the canvas. In contrast, Grace appears rather quiet and unremarkable, looking out, through round rimmed glasses, and dressed in a collared shirt. \\n\\nGraceâ€™s head and upper torso dominate the portrait. Behind her, the top half of the painting shows a light filled, green and yellow dappled background, while the bottom half is mostly darker tones, and includes a warm, deep-brown coloured object â€“ possibly the back of a chair. \\n\\nGrace has cropped hair, parted at the centre, and tucked behind her ears. Though it is neat, there is the impression of a wavy texture - created through layered brush strokes in mottled copper-browns, yellow-greens and deep-blues. Graceâ€™s oval face is tilted slightly up, and the right side is angled to the viewer, with light falling on it. Her forehead is high, rounded and smooth. Graceâ€™s eyebrows are obscured by her slender, brown-framed, round-rimmed glasses. \\n\\nThrough the lenses, Graceâ€™s gaze is striking â€“ her eyes are brown and almond shaped, and their look is direct; unfaltering. Perhaps the intense stare is aimed at the viewer, or perhaps at herself, as she works on her portrait, scrutinising her reflection in a mirror.\\n\\nGrace has a straight nose. Her natural-pink lips are pursed, and set in a serious expression. \\n\\nA pink brush stroke defines the curve of Graceâ€™s small, round chin. Three brown flecks give shape to the right side of her jaw, and vertical, smudged dabs in yellow-brown and pink, allude to the slackening skin of the neck of a woman in her mid-fifties. \\n\\nThe collar of Graceâ€™s shirt fits close to her neck, and comes together in a â€˜vâ€™. On Graceâ€™s right side, where the light touches it, the front of her shirt is painted in whites, pale pinks and browns, while on her left side, deep reds and patches of dark blue-green indicate shadows. \\n\\nThe bottom edge of the portrait crops Grace off mid-chest. In the left corner, beneath the short sleeve of her shirt, is her bare right arm.\\n\\nIn front of Graceâ€™s left shoulder, in the lower right corner of the painting there are three flat, rectangular shaped objects layered against each other. The objectsâ€™ shapes and positions suggest they are the yellow backs of two cardboard canvasses leaning against a brown, timber easel. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

From an artistic family, he began making paintings as a boy and developed a vigorous and expressive style. Although better known for his landscapes and mythical subjects, Boyd made a number of paintings of family and friends, and several self portraits. This one was painted in 1964 when Boyd was living in England. Aged 44, he had just finished a productive period working on set and costume designs for the Royal Ballet production of _Elektra_. Unlike much of Boyd's portraiture in which heads emerge out of a dark background, this self-portrait is painted on a simple white background using a neutral palette. Similar to his earliest self portrait, painted when he was seventeen, his penetrating eyes gaze off into the distance, but this time he looks apprehensive rather than determined, perhaps in response to his sadness following the death of his parents earlier in the decade. Returning to Australia in the early 1970s, Boyd bought a property on the Shoalhaven River on the south coast of New South Wales, Bundanon, which he subsequently gave to the Australian people. In 1975 he made an immense gift of his own work to the National Gallery of Australia.",

But, I mean, you donâ€™t ever come out with anything fresh or marvellous, it always seems ghastly when it goes up on the wall, and maybe it is.\\n\\nI hope itâ€™s becoming less taped, or typed. Not meant to be a pun, but anyway, I think thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d prefer to be happening, that itâ€™s becoming just as much mine, if I can make it that way, but much less typed in the sense that it would be, well, â€˜thatâ€™s Australianâ€™, or â€˜that comes from Melbourne, that comes from Ballarat, thatâ€™s where â€¦â€™. Iâ€™d like it to be much more a universal sort of thing.

The first of her thirteen solo exhibitions was held at Sydneyâ€™s Macquarie Galleries in 1940. Resident in England from 1969 to 1981, she continued to teach intermittently into the late 1970s. After a difficult first marriage to artist Eric Wilson, who died, she married painter Tom Green and they settled in Moss Vale. Though her work is now represented in major state and regional collections, Appleton was like many women artists of her generation in that recognition of her work came late in life: she was in her eighties when a public gallery first presented a retrospective exhibition of her art. \\n\\nJean Appleton won the inaugural Portia Geach Memorial Award in 1965 with this work.",

I like to work very freely and spontaneously in colour. And I feel if one has too much of a preconceived idea, one tends to lose the freshness and get a rather forced and striving feeling about it, as if you were trying to copy something that you already had seen in your mind.\\n\\nIâ€™ve found myself becoming increasingly interested in still life subjects. I feel I like to abstract them a good deal but Iâ€™m interested in shapes and objects in space, and their relationship to each other, and I look for the abstract qualities in these things rather than making any effort to reproduce them.\\n\\nIâ€™m interested in order; I donâ€™t like things to be chaotic, and I like to feel that there is an ordered relation between the parts of a painting. Colour, of course, is an absolute joy, and I love warm colours; reds, yellows and warm violets, although I get a great deal of pleasure out of blues, too â€“ I think itâ€™s perhaps unwise to say that you have any favourite colours.\\n\\nI like to work on a fairly large scale and I like to be able to start a painting and go on and work and work at it without being interrupted. I think thatâ€™s one of the most difficult things in this modern life we lead, being able to get away from interruptions.\\n\\nBut I do think itâ€™s awfully difficult to say just what your aim is in painting a picture. I feel that the picture says it for you much better than you can say it yourself. And I feel that any good thing in a painting is usually something that you canâ€™t talk about.",

Following her family's relocation from Forbes to Melbourne in the early 1940s, Dawson attended the private art school run by Harold Septimus Power. In 1951, aged sixteen, she enrolled at the National Gallery School and attended night classes with Sir William Dargie. Five years later, Dawson won a National Gallery of Victoria Travelling Scholarship and went to London, where she studied at the Slade School and the Central School. Returning to Melbourne in 1961, she held her first solo exhibition the same year and in 1963 set up an art school and workshop. Dawson was one of only three women included in the influential exhibition of Australian abstraction, _The Field_, at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1968. Her work is represented in all major public collections in Australia, and has been the subject of exhibitions at the NGV and the National Gallery of Australia.\\n\\nOutside of her lyrical abstract work, Dawson always practised portraiture and won the Archibald Prize in 1973 with a portrait of her husband, the late writer, actor and playwright Michael Boddy. Painted during an evening class at the National Gallery School, this self portrait shows Dawson wearing an artist's work shirt over her elegant day clothes, gazing confidently at the viewer.",

Now I find that although I must work directly, I usually work on about three or four paintings and a series of drawings before anything final comes out of this. A final, or a finalised painting, quite often happens fairly quickly. With my particular method it must be very fresh. I find that very clean, very fresh colour is essential. I find tremendous sensual delight in clarity and finality of area, so consequently a painting canâ€™t possibly have any labour on its actual surface, the labour must go on in other places. And I find that the more I work, the more prolonged are these periods of making studies and drawings.\\n\\nI find that Iâ€™m continually going back to the figure as being something that contains so much, so many possibilities. Through exploration, probably like all good sensualists, I keep finding the figure in landscape and the landscape in the figure; areas of flesh stretched across muscle or relaxed, tightened up, loose flesh, delicate little veins, bony areas, are things that I feel with tremendous ecstasy that Iâ€™ve never yet been able to put down in any way, something that Iâ€™m trying very hard to do at the moment.",

After a few yearsâ€™ drifting between Sydney and Brisbane, picking fruit to make a living, he connected with Barbara Patterson, a poet, who introduced him to literature. They moved to Melbourne, and married in 1951. She was legally blind; supported by her pension, and her earnings from modelling for artists, Blackman began to paint in earnest. With the support of art patrons John and Sunday Reed, he began to produce his signature series of paintings, incorporating schoolgirls with flowers, and Alice in Wonderland scenes with Barbara as his muse. The chase is one of several self portraits Blackman painted in Melbourne in the early 1950s, when he was working in the coupleâ€™s humble home alone. Felicity St John Moore, an authority on the artistâ€™s work, describes the paintingâ€™s imagery of living and dead flowers as an â€˜either-or choice between creation and spiritual deathâ€™, observing that the idea of clear choices facing a person at the moment of loss of adolescence â€“ common to both Rimbaud and Gide â€“ reflects Blackmanâ€™s intense interest in French literature at this time. Blackman and John Brack were amongst the seven artists who showed in the watershed â€˜Antipodeansâ€™ exhibition in Melbourne in 1959, asserting the importance of the figure in art in defiance of advancing American abstract expressionism. Having lived in London and Paris for some years in the 1960s, and separating civilly from Barbara in the late 1970s, Blackman proceeded to series of paintings of cats and gardens, becoming one of very few Australian artists to live to see one of his paintings sell for more than a million dollars.",

But it was not really a sort of disciplined thing, it wasnâ€™t really a thought-out thing. It was a thing where it was chasing a substance, it was kind of style chasing a substance. Once the substance was realised in some sort of sense, then the operative thing was to make it function properly, make it function fully. Itâ€™s like, sort of, driving a little baby Austin, finally you become a mature enough driver to be able to run an E-type Jag or a very complex piece of machinery. You have the emotional equipment realised, but it is then to make it a public fact, it is then to make it kind of articulate, a real articulate message in plastic terms, that is, it must be, the feeling must be couched properly in paint, the image must be embedded properly in the paint, must be trapped, as Francis Bacon says very well, in the paint.\\n\\nWell, now I work not so haphazardly, get up very early in the morning, go to the studio, clean up all the brushes, tidy up the room, sweep the floor and start working in a very detached sort of way, and work through disinterest to interest, or work, labour, very long hours on making a painting function within itself in a fairly detached sort of way. But this only could have been done by this kind of organic growth of the personality, it couldnâ€™t have been done in the artificial sense, you canâ€™t outside impose thoughts, they have to grow.",

Born in Queensland and raised in Melbourne, she commenced an Arts degree at the University of Melbourne in the 1940s, but was expelled on becoming pregnant to her boyfriend, Tim Burstall, later to become an influential filmmaker. They married in 1946 and shortly afterwards moved to Eltham, north-east of Melbourne where Betty worked at the local high school as a French and English teacher. In 1967, she founded La Mama in Carlton, an independent theatre modeled on the original off-Broadway theatre in New York, where she lived in the mid-1960s. Local actors, writers, directors, poets and musicians were encouraged to use the space for innovative, small-scale productions, providing an outlet for groundbreaking Australian theatre and fostering writers like David Williamson, Jack Hibberd and Tes Lyssiotis. Artistic director Liz Jones took over in the 1970s and La Mama still exists today. \\n\\nArthur Boyd produced few formal portraits but painted this work in the 1940s when Betty and Tim were regular visitors to his family's property in Murrumbeena. Boyd depicted Betty with flushed cheeks, lost in thought. He also used Betty's distinctive face in his religious paintings in the late 1940s, and in his murals at The Grange.",

And then I talked to a number of actors and directors and writers to see whether theyâ€™d be interested or not and they seemed to be interested but it became clear pretty quickly that the writers were the ones who were really interested because they despaired of ever being able to have their stuff done. The actors did have some sort of commercial work and were much less disillusioned. Directors were pretty interested because thereâ€™s very little opportunity for local people to direct their own plays. So, I found writers and I found directors and at first it was difficult finding actors disillusioned enough to come and perform virtually for nothing, because thatâ€™s how it works.\\n\\nIâ€™ve had some problems because it somehow seems that most plays that are done are obscene in some way or they would be by conventional standards or perhaps could be considered offensive in some way. Itâ€™s surprising actually, when I consider the sort of thing that is done, how few times it has happened but we have had on one particularly spectacular occasion Vice Squad visits and interference. This was when, outside La Mama and in the open, a play that was written by John Romeril, specifically an anti-censorship play, was being staged, actually satirising the vice squad. And the Vice Squad arrived, attempted to arrest the members of the cast and were followed to the police station by a sort of chanting audience. And charges were brought and in the end, I think, people were put on bonds and nothing very terrible happened to them, but it was rather unpleasant. I had to go to the vice squad people where I was interviewed in not the most pleasant way. And sort of warned to be very careful about what was done.\\n\\nI get great kicks out of La Mama and one thing that seems rather nice about it is that itâ€™s exactly the same as itâ€™s been from the very beginning. Now, six years later, itâ€™s as sordid, as small, as uncommercial and as wide open as it was.",

Oil on canvas measuring 80 centimetres in height by 64 centimetres wide. The portrait focuses on Bettyâ€™s head and torso. Her face is luminous and large dark eyes draw the viewer into the work. The dark curls of her hair nearly touch the top of the canvas. Her body has been cropped at the chest and shoulders which fills the lower half of the painting. She is angled to the right of the frame with her left shoulder in view.\\n\\nShort overlapping brushstrokes create a heavily textured surface for the skin of her face and neck. Bettyâ€™s face glows warmly in pale creamy flesh tones. The skin across her cheeks and nose blossom to darker shades of pinks and red. This creates a dramatic contrast with the plain dark background.\\n\\nVoluminous brunette curls flick loosely upwards to frame her broad round face. Her hair is cut to rest above her shoulders. Her left earlobe peeks out amid the dark curls which are tamed into a side part on the right. A few curls casually caress her short forehead. Her deep-set eyes are heavily lidded underneath a prominent brow. She has a long nose and a closed bow-shaped mouth slightly downturned above a softly rounded chin. Her expression is considered, direct and serious.\\n\\nBetty wears a long-sleeved olive-green top with a pointed collar. Loose brushstrokes create textured clothing. Light glistens off the fabric, which appears nearly golden around her neck. A dark line of paint creates a gathered effect across the front of her chest.\\n\\nThe combination of thickly applied paint, surrounding dark background and her sombre expression create a weightiness in the portrait.\\n\\nThe artistâ€™s signature, Arthur Boyd, is painted in black on the lower right.\\n\\n**Audio Description written by Alana Sivell and voiced by Amy Middleby**",

After 18 months in England, he became a founding member of the Australian Journalistsâ€™ Association before moving to work as political correspondent for the Sydney evening Sun. In 1915 he became managing editor of the United Cable Service of the Sun and Melbourne Herald in London. From there, he went to Gallipoli; his long, passionate (and distorted) account of the British attitude to Australians there had major ramifications. In 1921 he returned to Melbourne as editor of the evening Herald. Sales increased quickly, and he took over other papers. Over the ensuing years Murdoch acquired diverse media interests and became increasingly interventionist; some saw him as a serious â€˜cause of the deterioration in Australian politicsâ€™. From 1942 he was Chairman of Directors of the Herald and Weekly Times and director of the Herald, Sun News-Pictorial and associated publications. He married Elisabeth Greene in 1928, when he was 43 and she was nineteen. Their newspaperman son, Rupert, was to become one of the worldâ€™s most influential men.",

He subsequently became advertising manager at Smith's Newspapers and in 1933, in partnership with Edward Theodore, published the first edition of the _Australian Women's Weekly_. After inheriting the bulk of his father's media interests, he formed Consolidated Press, launching the _Daily Telegraph_ in 1936. His company Television Corporation was one of the first to hold a commercial television licence in Australia, with TCN-9 beginning test transmissions in July 1956. Packer was knighted in 1959. By the early 1960s, _Women's Weekly_ had grown to a circulation exceeding 800,000, helping Australian Consolidated Press (as it was known from 1957) become the largest magazine publisher in the southern hemisphere by the time of Packer's death.  \\n  \\nA keen art collector, Packer supported artists through the _Women's Weekly_ art prizes. Judy Cassab won the women's section of the _Weekly's_ portrait prize in 1955 and 1956, leading to the creation of this portrait of Packer. It was acquired by ACP some years later. Packer's widow and second wife, Florence, Lady Packer, recalled that it had 'lived mainly in Frank's favourite place: the office'.",

Having lectured at the University of London he returned to Australia in 1955, soon taking up a post as a philosophy lecturer at the University of Melbourne. Having published _Berkeleyâ€™s Theory of Vision_ (1960) he became a senior lecturer, completed his PhD and brought forth _Perception and the Physical World_ (1961) and _Bodily Sensations_ (1962). In 1964 he became Challis Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney and held this position, interrupted only by visiting professorships in the USA, until his retirement some 28 years later. _A Materialist Theory of the Mind_ (1968) introduced the world to â€˜Australian materialismâ€™. Besides writing a plethora of books, the last published in 2010, throughout his life he engaged in public and political affairs, active in the Australian Association for Cultural Freedom and closely involved with its journal, _Quadrant_. Andrew Irvine wrote in _Quadrant_ in 2014 â€˜Armstrongâ€™s influence on Australian culture has been enormous simply because his influence on world culture has been enormous.â€™ ****\\n\\nDavid Armstrong read a draft of the Antipodean Manifesto on art, which Pugh signed, but â€˜could not render the verbiage into academically acceptable Englishâ€™. The portrait of Armstrong was Pughâ€™s entry in the Archibald Prize of 1959.",

After studying law for two years, Humphries joined the Melbourne Theatre Company. In 1955 he created his archetypes of suburban mediocrity: Mrs Edna Everage, a Moonee Ponds mother and housewife, her longsuffering husband Norm, and the washed-out, ruminative Sandy Stone. From the late 1950s Humphries performed in his own one-man shows in Australia, Britain, Europe and the US, and Edna Everage held court with increasing flamboyance in shows including _Housewife_, _Super-star; Edna_, _the Spectacle_; and _Eat Pray Laugh!_, which Humphries announced would be her last. In 2000 Humphries won a Special Tony Award, a Drama Desk Award, a Theatre World Award, and an Outer Critics Circle Award. He was the subject of the National Portrait Gallery's first large-scale biographical exhibition in 2002. His many books include two different autobiographies, _More Please_ (1992) and _My Life as Me_ (2002) as well as an autobiography of Edna Everage, _My Gorgeous Life_ (1997) in which the meeting between Humphries and Everage is described in detail.\\n\\nClifton Pugh and Barry Humphries became friendly in the 1950s and Humphries sometimes went to stay at Dunmoochin, Pugh's home in the bush near Melbourne. Pugh's portrait of Humphries looking 'haunted, angular and aesthetic' â€“ the very first work acquired by the National Portrait Gallery â€“ was painted there. Through his association with Pugh, Humphries's schoolboy interest in art revived, and Pugh helped him mount an exhibition of his works in the gallery of the Victorian Artists' Society. The exhibition featured some collaborative collages by Humphries and Pugh and an installation of boxes of 'Platytox', a shocking product purportedly designed to eradicate the platypus and most marsupials.",

They wore the uniforms of rebellious university students just as they do today, and in a sense theyâ€™re the most conformist of all social groups.\\n\\nI was surprised and disappointed at this, so, again, with the aid of some of my old Melbourne Grammar friends and a few new ones, we reformed the Dada group and we held, in two consecutive years of 1951 and 1952, two widely publicised and spectacular Dada exhibitions in the menâ€™s lounge of the Union at Melbourne University. The catalogues of these two Dada exhibitions survive and are, of course, interesting documents of the period. They consist really of an anarchic attack on certain aspects of modern art which were becoming domesticated â€“ that is to say, Melbourne housewives who knew nothing about art, other than perhaps Arthur Streeton or Hans Heysen on a calendar, were now espousing the post-impressionists, so the exhibitions contained scathing attacks of Van Gogh, Gaugin and Cezanne, indeed on everything that was acceptable to the Australian bourgeoisie, indeed the informed Australian bourgeoisie of this period.\\n\\nThese were happenings, I suppose, though that word hadnâ€™t been coined. As the students came along I would stand on a dais and open the exhibition with a kind of crazy speech and already I was giving vent to a frustrated theatrical energy. I was moving slowly, you know, from painting, from a pictorial language to a theatrical means of self-expression. Within, I was merely a frustrated youth, not at all knowing how best to please my parents, what profession indeed I would ever follow and when was it all going to end?",

Her poems accordingly reflect 'the love of the land we have invaded and the guilt of the invasion'. Wright met and married the journalist, playwright and bushman Jack McKinney in the 1940s, and the couple became good friends with Charles and Barbara Blackman. Meredith McKinney (b. 1950) was to become a scholar of Japanese and a literary translator. Her collaborative translations of her mother's works have been published in Australia and Japan. This work recalls a day when the Blackman and Wright/ McKinney families, both to assume great cultural significance to Australia, happily picnicked at Cedar Creek near Tamborine in the winter of 1955. It was in private collections for more than forty years before Barbara Blackman heard it was for sale through a Melbourne gallery. She purchased the painting of her 'good dear beloved long friend' especially for the National Portrait Gallery, which she has long championed. In May 2000 the two women were present at a function in the gallery to celebrate the acquisition of the work and Wright's 85th birthday. Wright died just a few weeks later. \\n\\nCharles Blackman OBE (1928-2018), artist, studied at East Sydney Technical College before moving to Melbourne, where he came to the attention of art patron John Reid. With Reid's support, he began to produce his signature series of images, incorporating schoolgirls with flowers and Alice in Wonderland figures and motifs. He was a signatory to the Antipodean Manifesto (loosely, a defence of figuration against abstraction) in the early 1950s. After he won the Helena Rubenstein Scholarship in 1960, his work was shown in the important Whitechapel and Tate exhibitions in London in 1961-1962. Exhibiting prolifically throughout his career, over the 1970s he produced softer images of cats and gardens. In the early 1990s, a period during which he revisited themes of his early work, a Blackman retrospective show toured nationally. Renowned especially for his drawing, Blackman is represented in the National Gallery of Australia and all state galleries.",

The frame is narrow light wood with a stepped surface. This dark shadowy portrait shows the heads and shoulders of, in a row from the left: Jack McKinney, Judith Wright, and their daughter Meredith McKinney. They are painted in a distinctive stylised manner. \\n\\nThe background is divided horizontally; the top fifth is painted pale cream and the lower part, behind the figures, is a mixture of dark browns and greys. The focus is on the figuresâ€™ faces and hats.\\n\\nJack, on the left, wears a hat with a square box-like crown in washed-out blue above a round reddish brim. His face is blue and almost rectangular. His eyes are on a slant. The eye on our left is lower and larger than the other. Below a dark brow, it is an elongated green almond with a large black iris. The eye on the right is higher on the face, set beneath the hat brim; blue with a black iris and a flash of orange highlighting the eyelid. The straight edges of Jackâ€™s nose run parallel to his cheek. His ear on the far left of the portrait is a loop of apricot and blue with a dark centre. Just below the ear, a hand rests on Jackâ€™s shoulder. The lower part of his face and neck is obscured by deep shadow, only interrupted by a sprig of blue-green foliage. \\n\\nThe central figure, Judith, appears shorter than Jack. Her hat with its much flatter rounded crown and narrow brim does not stand as tall as his. The hat is blue and white striped with dashes of red, orange, and green. Judithâ€™s eyes sit in shade under its brim. They are wide-spaced, blue, with pointed inner corners. Their black irises are positioned towards their rounded outer ends. Just beneath Judithâ€™s eyes, a bunch of flowers of different shapes, sizes, and bright colours, hides the half of her face to our left. On the right her face is painted with smudges of white and pink. A pale haze on either side of her face suggests hair. \\n\\nBetween Judith and Meredith, on our far right, is another brightly coloured bouquet. This seems to be held by one of the figures' hands at the very bottom edge of the portrait.\\n\\nMeredith, on the far right, is smaller and shorter than her parents. Her hat has a square crown with a dome fitted within it sitting on a narrow brim. The hat is patterned with blue, white, yellow, and orange flowers. Beneath the hat is a dark band of shadow concealing Meredithâ€™s eyes. Her face, with grey and white skin, tapers with straight lines to a square chin. Her nose is triangular with a narrow bridge widening out to large, rounded nostrils. Meredithâ€™s lips are small and closed, crimson, outlined with black. On either side of her face is an irregular elongated blue-grey shape, possibly representing hair. In front of her chest is a mass of yellow and blue swirls. Meredith wears a white pointed collar and a floral-patterned top with yellow highlighting her shoulder on the far right of the portrait.\\n\\n**Audio description written and voiced by Lucie Shawcross, 2021**",

She met Hal Hattam, doctor, keen amateur painter and patron of the arts, in England during the war. In Melbourne, the couple became friends with a group of inner-city intellectuals and aesthetes, and entertained and encouraged many emerging artists who have since become household names. At Kateâ€™s behest, artists including John Perceval, Arthur Boyd and Leonard French designed wrapping paper and greeting cards for Georges. The Hattam family homes in Canterbury and South Yarra housed an unrivalled body of works by artists in their circle and beyond. \\n\\nClifton Pugh was a close friend of the Hattams and they championed his work. They went regularly to Pugh's home, Dunmoochin, on weekends, and also saw the Pughs at Shoreham, where each family had a house. This portrait captures Kate's style and determination in Pugh's characteristic elongated forms and bold colour against an abstract background. Pugh recalled that it was rare for him to make portraits in this period, 'but then of course, I knew Kate so well. It was a picture that I wanted to do.'",

Having served with distinction during the Second World War, he became a leading and influential legal practitioner, serving as chairman of the Victorian Bar Council in the 1950s. He was a longstanding member of the Labor Party, and was deeply involved in Jewish community affairs throughout his life. Ashkanasy helped improve representation to government for Jewish groups, contributed to the foundation of the Judean League and the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies, and was five times president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.\\n\\nKarl Duldig studied art in Vienna between 1923 and 1933 and fled to Switzerland shortly before Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938. He then went to Singapore where he ran an art school, but was deported to Australia as an enemy alien in 1940. After a year in an internment camp in Victoria, he became an art teacher while also gaining recognition for his expressionist sculptures. Awarded the Victorian Sculptor's Society Prize in 1956, Duldig received commissions up until the year before his death at age 83.",

Rivett regularly visited Brisbaneâ€™s brothels as municipal medical officer, and was an early and persistent advocate of birth control and sexual health. She gained her master's degree in surgery in 1918. In 1929 Christine became the first Queensland woman to gain an A-class pilotâ€™s licence, and became a foundation member of the Queensland Medical Women's Society. Meanwhile, in 1927, her brother Edward bought a Walter Burley Griffin house in Castlecrag, Sydney, which he converted to a private maternity hospital. After the Second World War, Christine joined her brother, practising obstetrics and experimenting in telepathy and ESP. Brother and sister died within a few months of each other.\\n\\nDaphne Mayo received a gold medal for sculpture at London's Royal Academy of Arts and worked tirelessly to promote appreciation of the arts in Queensland.

The first modernist paintings in Australia arose from his openness to new ideas, and his studio was the venue for stimulating talks by artists who had been able to travel and observe developments in art overseas. However, he painted in a conventional style himself, and later publicly condemned the modern art that he had promoted. He was a member of the Brother Brushes of Bondi, started the Atelier Club, and helped to found both the Manly Art Gallery and Historical Collection and the Dante Alighieri Art and Literary Society.\\n\\nArthur Murch, sculptor and painter, was one of the many significant Australian modernist artists to have trained at Antonio Dattilo Rubbo's school in Sydney.",

The company began producing bodies for the American-owned General Motors in 1923, with Holden overseeing its further expansion. In 1931 GM bought the company â€“ undertaking to maintain its Australian character â€“ and Holden became chairman of General Motors-Holden's Ltd. He served as a Liberal member of South Australia's Legislative Council from 1935 to 1947 and was knighted in 1945. Thereafter he continued his corporate service with bodies including the South Australian Industries Assistance Corporation, the Chamber of Commerce and the Bank of Adelaide.\\n\\nLeslie Bowles was born in Sydney and began his studies in modelling and carving in Brisbane. In 1910 he won a scholarship to study at the South London School of Sculpture and the Royal Academy School. After serving in the Royal Tank Corps in France from 1914 to 1919, he returned to Australia and worked on the production of dioramas for the Australian War Memorial. He was head sculptor at the Memorial from 1925 to 1931.",

He worked as a commercial editor on the Age and made his first investments in the textiles industry before a visit to Broken Hill sparked his interest in mining. Entering into a partnership with his brother in his London stockbroking company, he began to advise on the expansion of mines over a large area of Queensland and New South Wales, from Cloncurry to Broken Hill. Robinson was crucial to the moulding of Australian policy on non-ferrous metals during and after World War I, and acted as the Prime Ministerâ€™s personal adviser on the lead and zinc industries until 1920. In 1930, he coordinated a group of Australian and international financiers to form Gold Mines of Australia (GMA). Western Mining Corporation developed out of GMA in 1933 to number amongst the base metal mining companies combined as the Collins House group. During World War 2 the enormous task of dovetailing British demand for base metals with Australiaâ€™s (and other) sources of supply fell to Robinson, and he endured a phenomenal amount of punishing international travel to ensure there were no bottlenecks in vital supplies and raw materials for the allied war effort. Robinsonâ€™s memoirs, If I remember rightly, were published in 1967.\\n\\nSir William Dobell OBE (1899â€“1970) trained at the Julian Ashton School before spending ten years abroad, studying at the Slade School and exhibiting at the Royal Academy. When he returned, he was hailed as a modernist. After working in a camouflage unit he was appointed an official war artist; as such, he produced some of his most inspired portraits including The Billy Boy, one of Australiaâ€™s best-loved, and supposedly defining, artworks. In 1943 his strange portrait of his fellow artist, Joshua Smith, won the Archibald Prize; but the court case that ensued over whether the work was a portrait or a caricature caused great distress to both artist and sitter. In 1948 he won the Archibald less controversially with his portrait of Margaret Olley, and he won the Wynne Prize for landscape the same year. A third successful Archibald painting followed in 1959, and Time commissioned his portrait of Robert Menzies for its cover in 1960. The Art Gallery of New South Wales held a huge Dobell retrospective in 1964. After the artistâ€™s death his entire estate went to the creation of the Dobell Foundation, which benefits various organisations and funds the Chair of Fine Arts at the Australian National University.",

Born in Launceston, Tasmania, he enlisted at the beginning of World War I and served in the Australian Flying Corps, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1919 he qualified as a pilot. Later that year he was commissioned by the government to survey the Darwin to Longreach section of the Britain-Australia Air Race, which lack of funds had prevented him from entering. In November 1920 Fysh and Pat McGinnis, who had driven with him on the survey, joined two others to form Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Ltd (QANTAS). Fysh became managing director of the company in 1923, but continued to work as a pilot over the next seven years as QANTAS established various routes and functions in Queensland, including an air ambulance service. In 1934, in partnership with Imperial Airways, QANTAS began to operate the Singapore-Australia air route, trading as Qantas Empire Airways (QEA). Six years later Fysh became a director of Tasman Empire Airways Ltd, which flew to and from New Zealand. Fysh oversaw further expansion of QEA, and its purchase by the Australian government, before retiring as the companyâ€™s managing director in 1955 and chairman in 1966. Between 1965 and 1973, he published three autobiographical volumes covering the history of Qantas; a biography of Henry Reed, a key figure in the early development of Launceston; and book on trout fishing, Round the Bend in the Stream.\\n\\nWilliam Dobell (1899â€“1970) was commissioned to paint Fysh for the thirtieth anniversary of Qantas in 1950. Though he and his wife liked it, Fysh described the painting as â€˜rather a shock to some peopleâ€™. It was, he said, â€˜a magnificent piece of work of a great master, but the treatment of the faceâ€¦ made me look so dissipated and haggard as to cause me to remark that if someone in fifty yearsâ€™ time were told that the subject was a founder of the great airline Qantas, he would refuse to believe it.â€™",

Showing little promise as an artist, he qualified as a tailor and cutter in London. His grandfather was David Jones, and he began work in the David Jones clothing factory in 1902. By 1905, he was the storeâ€™s advertising manager; he became a director in 1906, when David Jones Limited became a public company, and was to be its chairman from 1920 to 1958, as the store expanded in Sydney and then across the country. A cofounder of Art in Australia and The Home in the 1920s, he was a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales for twenty-four years and established the David Jones Art Gallery. He took a keen interest in music, and amongst his many other public positions was the first chairmanship of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, in 1932. That year, as a member of the Board of Control of the new Australian National Travel Association, Jones gave a lecture on â€˜Selling Australia to the Worldâ€™, a topic which remained of vital interest to him. The Travel Association arranged for the production and overseas distribution of posters and booklets showing Australiaâ€™s scenery, flora and fauna, and produced a booklet, â€˜Talking Pointsâ€™, available to any Australian travelling abroad, suggesting conversational gambits that would shed favourable light on the country. Jones persisted with his own painting, and exhibited often with the Society of Artists. Meanwhile, he built up a very significant collection of paintings by other artists. He lived at Rosemont in Ocean Street, Woollahra, and was a genial member of several clubs.\\n\\nWilliam Dobell (1899â€“1970) painted Jones the year he was knighted, during the six-year period in which he was commodore of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron (by the time he took up the position, in 1949, he had been sailing out of the Squadron for forty-six years). Jonesâ€™s close friend, Sir Robert Menzies, gave his funeral oration.",

As a young woman she had abandoned her studies at the University of Sydney and turned her back on an oppressively respectable â€“ and sometimes violent â€“ upbringing. An atheist and advocate of free love, her only significant relationship ended when she was 38. Thereafter, she became known for her anarchic conduct in public places, although she did carry a board advertising her willingness to recite Shakespeare for a fee. She loved tram and taxi travel, though she rarely paid, and often hurled herself at vehicles refusing to carry her. She frequented the Public Library of New South Wales until being banned from the building in the late 1950s. As documented in this drawing by Roderick Shaw, Miles was usually seen wearing a tennis visor and a greatcoat. The drawing is posthumous and based on a photograph, and was commissioned for an exhibition in 1976. Miles was nevertheless an apt subject for Shaw, who was a founding member of Artists for Democracy and of Artists Against Nuclear War and who is known for his social realist paintings on themes such as work and urban life.",

Diagnosed with optic atrophy, she was declared blind by the age of 22. 'It seemed to me I was given a life sentence for a crime I had not committed,' she wrote in her 1997 autobiography _Glass after Glass_. She met artist Charles Blackman after moving to Sydney to study, and by 1952 they'd married and relocated to Melbourne. There they became associated with the avant-garde group centred around the Melbourne Contemporary Art Society, and Barbara modelled for artist friends including John Brack and Clifton Pugh. She came to consider her blindness a gift for the richer access it provided to words, poetry, intuition and the imagination, and it had a profound influence on her husband's art, prompting works such as his _Schoolgirls_ and _Alice_ series, in which he created dreamlike imagery based on personal, literary and musical themes. Barbara Blackman also worked as a magazine columnist and a radio-producer for Radio for the Print Handicapped, and helped form the National Federation of Blind Citizens. A documentary about her life, _Seeing from Within_, was released in 2017.",

But somehow what his creations came out of â€“ a sort of a living or understanding of poetry â€“ was something that always bound us and still binds us together. But at that time when I recognised Charles as potentially a very great painter and a great creator, I relinquished my strong intentions of being a writer and although I went on writing diaries and sometimes poems and more and more I became a very prolific letter-writer as I gathered more and more interesting people as friends and we became more and more separated by distance, my writing changed course, as in fact my life had changed course to become devoted to Charlesâ€™ optimal putting forward of himself as a painter.\\n\\nYou know, when we married I said, â€˜Well if youâ€™re going to be a painter, youâ€™re going to paint, youâ€™re not going to go out and get a job doing something or another,â€™ so he stayed home and painted. And by this time my eyesight had failed almost altogether and I was on a blind pension, so we had that as a basis to live on. And the only thing I could really do was to work as an artistâ€™s model, as a nude model, which in fact I quite enjoyed because I was picking up a lot of information about painting. Itâ€™s quite an elegant job in its way, being a model, because one can decide oneâ€™s own poses and itâ€™s a very private occupation. One can have oneâ€™s own thoughts and one has the satisfaction of knowing oneâ€™s doing a job well.",

Born on Ukerebagh Island at the mouth of the Tweed River, New South Wales, Bonner worked in labouring jobs before moving to Palm Island, Queensland, his wife's traditional home, which was at that time a government-run penal settlement. There, he began his involvement in community affairs, joining the Palm Island Social Welfare Association. After moving to Ipswich in 1960, he joined the One People of Australia League (OPAL), later becoming Queensland President in 1968 and National President in 1980. He joined the Liberal Party after the successful 1967 Referendum. In 1971, the Liberal Party invited him to fill a Senate vacancy; famously, soon after giving his maiden speech, he demonstrated how to throw a boomerang on the Senate Lawn. Elected as Senator in four subsequent elections between 1972 and 1980, he frequently crossed the floor to vote with the Opposition on Indigenous issues. After retiring from politics, he served as a member of the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and was a patron of World Vision and Amnesty International.\\n\\nWell-known for his pen and ink drawings, Louis Kahan's works comprise an expressive composite portrait of Australian public figures in the 1960s and 1970s. This quick sketch captures Bonner's strength and focus.",

In Paris again, he was an illustrator for _Le Figaro_, but in 1947 he came to Australia, settling in Melbourne.

He received his first lessons in art from his father, an amateur painter, before studying with Antonio Dattilo Rubbo at the Royal Art Society and at the East Sydney Technical College. Unlike most of his artist contemporaries, Hinder went to the United States for further study, training at the Art Institute of Chicago school in 1927â€“28 and studying commercial art at the New York School of Fine and Applied Art and the Master Institute of the Roerich Museum. He worked as a commercial artist in America and taught at an art school in Boston before returning to Australia with his wife, the New York-born sculptor Margel Harris, and their daughter, Enid, in 1934. In Sydney, Hinder and Margel became involved with artists Ralph Balson, Grace Crowley and Rah Fizelle, enlivening the 1930s art scene with modernist work based on his experience of cubism. Among his best known works are those inspired by the cityâ€™s underground railway system, such as Subway, Wynyard (1948). Hinder was a founding member of the Contemporary Art Society and in 1939 helped organise Australiaâ€™s first exhibition of abstract art, Exhibition 1. Hinder worked in the camouflage unit of the Royal Australian Engineers during World War II, devising methods of concealing large structures such as the petrol storage tanks in Newcastle and Port Kembla. After the war, he taught at the East Sydney Technical College and the Sydney Teachersâ€™ College and also worked in theatre design and commercial art. Hinderâ€™s abstract paintings and electric light sculptures attracted much critical acclaim and he assisted Margel in the completion of a number of public sculpture commissions in the 1950s and 60s. This self portrait is characteristic of Hinderâ€™s work in its sharp-edged precision.",

Itâ€™s quite different to the way I worked previously, when I made very careful and thorough drawings, enlargements, colour sketches and so forth. I feel again, as my wife said, as she feels sheâ€™s becoming more on the expressionist side, so my own work in one sense is loosening up, and I find possibly that starting on the job itself and trying to carry it through then possibly either throwing it away or scraping it off and starting again, allows one to do things that are a more definite approach. Sometimes [it] ties down. In other words, I think I tend to be much too tight or worry too much about the little sketches, and in the process of doing that the big one loses a certain amount of spontaneity. Iâ€™m quite sure itâ€™s my fault; itâ€™s not in the procedure because the old masters, I understood it, worked that way and certainly their final results, to me, leave nothing to be desired. But again, itâ€™s the method of trying a slightly different approach.\\n\\n[Iâ€™m] still working, of course, with theatre, and with this, and at the moment Iâ€™m getting back to painting again, as there seems to be less theatre work, and so I have more time too.\\n\\nI should have mentioned previously, of course, one reason I married my wife was, I thought I had one of the best critics, and sheâ€™d be very handy to have around, apart from any other reason.\\n\\nAnd as she knows, I usually ask her opinion, and then she gets very irritated if I, not necessarily disagree with her but I still insist, that she says â€˜What?â€™ but Iâ€™ve found itâ€™s pretty infallible. In other words, Iâ€™m not my own best critic by a long shot, and one needs a certain amount of either support, moral support or an outside view, I think, and I certainly value hers more than anyone elseâ€™s.",

After war service he resumed his studies, and in 1949 secured a job in the National Gallery of Victoriaâ€™s Print Room, where he worked until 1951, leaving to take up the position of art master at Melbourne Grammar School. His paintings succeeded immediately; his first exhibited work, Barberâ€™s Shop, was purchased for the NGV in 1953 as was Collins Street, 5pm, three years later. In 1962 he became Head of the National Gallery Art School. Six years later, finally confident that he could make a living as a full-time artist, he resigned. He painted shopfronts, school yards, gardens and housing estates, nudes, office workers, ballroom dancers, jockeys, brides, drinkers, commissioned portraits and portraits of friends and family. In recent years _The Bar_ 1954 and _The Old Time_ 1969 have set new auction records for the sale of Australian paintings. This drawing was presented by the young John Brack to his friend Ursula Hoff, who was the Keeper of Prints at the National Gallery of Victoria from 1949. The work is much softer than the paintings, drawings and prints for which Brack was soon to become renowned. Art historian Sasha Grishin explains that the young artist used a study Georges Seurat made for Une Baignade, AsniÃ¨res, as a guide to his own materials and composition.",

What Iâ€™m interested in in painting is people, of course, principally, how they live, how they behave, how they get the faces they deserve, how they can bear to put up with a life which seems so curiously tragic.\\n\\nOf course I know that to be interested in peopleâ€™s behaviour for a painter is most impure. Itâ€™s called literary, and in our day nothing could be a greater sin than to be a literary painter; but now Iâ€™m old enough to feel that itâ€™s a waste of time to apologise for not painting in some other way, and the fact is that Iâ€™m still always fascinated by people and their behaviour. And yet at the same time, itâ€™s not enough to just paint pictures of ideas; at the same time we must put it into a visual form which is as complete as any abstract visual form. And here, thereâ€™s always a conflict between the demands of the idea and the demands of the form.\\n\\nAnd in any case, Iâ€™m always dubious about the remarks painters make about their own work, because what we so often say is rather what we would like to have done than what weâ€™ve really done.",

That year she helped establish the Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC), which sought to eliminate discrimination in the private rental market. Using a $500,000 grant from the Whitlam government, the AHC helped create a sense of belonging for people living in The Block, which became in turn became the centre of the civil rights movement in Australia. Four decades later, in protest against the proposed sale of The Block for commercial development, she established the Redfern Aboriginal Tent Embassy. During 2014 and 2015 she lived there for 400 days, leading the campaign to preserve access to affordable housing for Aboriginal families and maintain The Block's significance as a site for First Nations self-determination, community and leadership.\\n\\nAt first glance it might appear that photographer and filmmaker John Janson-Moore's portrait of Munro was taken at a campsite on Wiradjuri country. In fact, it shows her outside the tent she occupied in Redfern for fifteen months, in the midst of a land rights battle fought in Australia's most populous city.",

My writing is nearly all early morning or late at night at home, conceived in the head as I walk. I walk an enormous amount, walk around the suburbs and things like that, and things come in my head when Iâ€™m walking, largely because I find it very hard to concentrate unless my body is active. Perhaps this is a result of my obsession with sport, which I regard as a kind of activity in which the dichotomy between soul and body gets relaxed, a kind of activity in which I find release. I find it very hard, indeed I envy painters and sculptors very much because they have a physical activity which corresponds to the production of their art, whereas poets can only sit there and write, and this I find difficult. I get up and pace and dance and walk around and go for long walks, just as a way to release myself.\\n\\nI find my poetry can begin in any one of a host of ways. I suppose much more when I was young it came just from lines in the head, rhythms, almost you might say, melodies. Now it comes in a variety of ways but ideas play a much larger part now. Seldom do I find poems coming immediately out of a direct experience. It takes a prolonged period, for the most part, of contemplation wherein one experience feeds into other experiences, forms of language, metaphors, ideas coming from quite different areas, until the whole conception becomes dense enough to produce a poem. I find if I try and write poems immediately out of some intense emotional experience, itâ€™s odds on theyâ€™ll be merely subjective or private or rhetorical. I need to find something that produces enough density to create a poem that works and not just something for the scrapbook.",

After learning watercolour technique, he was persuaded to exhibit his work in Melbourne in 1938. The exhibition sold out in two days. Demand for his paintings increased during the 1940s and he was the subject of a biography and a film, _Namatjira the Painter_. In 1954 he met the young Queen Elizabeth II in Canberra, and he was awarded citizenship status in 1957. One of the consequences of citizenship was that Namatjira was legally entitled to buy alcohol, but when he shared it with his fellow Arrernte, as custom required, he was sentenced to imprisonment. Although the sentence was commuted, he never recovered, and he died the following year. Over sixty years after his death, Namatjira remains the best known Australian Aboriginal painter.\\n\\nAxel Poignant began photographing Aboriginal people during excursions to Pingelly, Western Australia in 1938 and the Canning Stock Route in 1942. He spent three months with Namatjira and his wife Rubina (Ilkalita, 1903â€“1974) while working as a cameraman on _Namatjira the Painter_. A Kukatja woman, Ilkalita and Albert had five sons and three daughters who survived infancy. During his time with the Namatjiras, Poignant developed a strong appreciation of the bond between Aboriginal people and their Country.",

In 1963 he and his friend, composer Peter Sculthorpe AO OBE (1929-2014), took a working holiday in Tasmania. Out of this trip emerged Sculthorpeâ€™s best-known piece, â€˜Small Townâ€™, inspired in part by Drysdaleâ€™s paintings of towns and dedicated to the painter. In 2014, after the composerâ€™s death, an American writer for the _New Yorker_ described visiting Victoria for the first time, and finding that Sculthorpeâ€™s pizzicato and percussive effects â€˜perfectly evoked the landscape . . . its vernacular architecture, beautiful stands of eucalyptus, red hills, dry grass, and sudden screaming flocks of lorikeetsâ€™. The composer once said that like the painter, he had come to look on his â€˜whole output as one slowly emerging workâ€™. At Tallow Beach on the central coast of NSW, close to Drysdaleâ€™s property at Bouddi, David Moore photographed two men who profoundly influenced Australiansâ€™ way of imagining their own place, creating, as he did so, one of the great Australian portraits-in-the-landscape.",

And so everything that I write comes from my feelings or my experience of life and of living.\\n\\nItâ€™s getting started that is the difficulty, and almost always I get started through some, well, feeling in my heart, that sounds vague but it means something to me anyway, or something that I see, even something that I smell, but rarely anything that I hear, oddly enough. Once Iâ€™ve got started, Iâ€™m right. And I am a slow worker, but then to be a composer itâ€™s just sheer hard work.\\n\\nYou have to forget technique or else you maybe just get beyond it, in a sense be as a kind of sieve, although I donâ€™t believe in spiritualism, shall we say, Iâ€™ll use the word medium, in that it comes through you in some way. Because if I am being occupied with the technique, somehow the message just will not get across or the heart thing. Itâ€™s very hard to explain, and this is why I canâ€™t really talk about method.\\n\\nI suppose I have lots of little secrets and I suppose that this is why my music always sounds like me, because it has the same faults and the same virtues, if any, whatever kind of piece it may happen to be. This is something that I try to get across to my students, theyâ€™ve just got to write and write and write until they can handle notes and juggle them about, and then just forget all about it and abandon themselves to being what they are.",

I know that lots of people say that they canâ€™t see much in the burnt dried-up plains. But on the other hand, youâ€™ve got this tremendous sense of space, of freedom, allied to it again a strange, age-old quality, and you get without doubt, a tremendously romantic element.\\n\\nOneâ€™s only got to walk around about on the Nullarbor Plain and look at the shapes of organisms, the long dead age, sea forms that reveal themselves for you on the rocks patterned like tracery, things that lived 15 million years ago in the Miocene seas. And besides you, peculiar spectacle of a railway running across this former sea bed, ballasted with the fossil remains of these creatures. See, youâ€™ve got all the elements of most extraordinary sort of dramas, I mean, they have an effect, they help one to look at a landscape, they help one to see these peculiar things.\\n\\nI donâ€™t think I can elaborate very much more, really, because itâ€™s quite difficult to talk about oneâ€™s own paintings. One just does them, really.\\n\\nEverybody knows the elemental factors that go to make works of art, but when one tries to talk about oneself and oneâ€™s point of view, the same old question comes up: you really donâ€™t quite know. Thereâ€™s first of all the impact, and there you are.",

When the present-day polymer plastic notes began to replace paper ones in 1992, Andrews served on the advisory panel overseeing their design. Andrews was nominated a Fellow of the Society of Industrial Artists (UK) in 1955 and was the first Australian designer to be elected an Honorary Designer for Industry of the Royal Society of Arts (UK) in 1989.",

In the original problem of producing the one, two, ten and twenty, I had thought of using Caroline Chisholm on the reverse of the one to go with Her Majestyâ€™s portrait, but the bank knocked that right back. They said, â€˜Well, we donâ€™t quite think that Caroline Chisholm is the right person.â€™ In any case, it wasnâ€™t a very good idea, I think that it was better to have something quite abstract on the back of that one. Finally, then, in the next series, once the first four were published, they then quickly said, â€˜Well, we must now produce a fiveâ€™ which was always intended in the first series. So I put Caroline Chisholm up again and then she was okayed. Theyâ€™d had time to think about it.\\n\\nFor the two dollar I had two primary production people, I had a wool man and the wheat man, the backbone original thing of Australia. Then on the 10 dollar I had two people from the field of art, one an architect and one a writer. Then on the 20 I got into the more inventive things and the more courageous things. Aviation was a good theme so I used Smithy and Hargrave, Smithy being the great explorer, aviator, and Hargrave being a great inventor of aircraft.\\n\\nAlthough bank notes are security documents and the first problem, right in front of your mind always, must be security â€“ how can you make it more difficult for a counterfeiter to copy â€“ it still remains, in a sense, a work of art, or Iâ€™d prefer to call it, in fact, a work of design, because I believe that design also can come under the broad heading as art. A really good piece of design is in a sense a work of art.",

Summers became involved in women's rights while studying politics at the University of Adelaide, and was one of five founders of the Women's Liberation Movement group in Adelaide in 1969. After moving to Sydney, she was part of a cooperative that established Australia's first refuge for domestic violence victims. As a journalist for _The National Times_ she investigated NSW prisons, which led to a royal commission and a Walkley Award for Summers. Appointed head of the Office for the Status of Women in 1983, Summers was instrumental in the passage of the Anti-Discrimination Act; in the 1990s she worked as an adviser to Prime Minister Paul Keating. In New York from 1986 to 1992, Summers was editor-in-chief of _Ms_ magazine; and later edited the _Good Weekend_. Author of eight books, her memoir _Unfettered and Alive_ was published in 2018 and she is a columnist for the _Sydney Morning Herald_.\\n\\nThese portraits by Carol Jerrems were taken in January 1974, while Summers was working intensely on _Damned Whores and God's Police_ in her Birchgrove flat. Summers has said the portraits capture her anxiety about this project as well as the steeliness that enabled her to complete it.",

Having narrowly escaped Auschwitz as a girl, Mora trained in drama in Paris. By 1951, when she came to Melbourne with her husband, Georges, she was committed to painting. Soon the couple became friends with the city's leading artists and collectors, and were instrumental in the re-formation of the Contemporary Art Society. Over the 1950s and 1960s they opened the European-style Mirka CafÃ© in Exhibition Street, Balzac in East Melbourne and the Tolarno in St Kilda. While Georges established himself as an art dealer, opening Tolarno Galleries in 1967, Mirka became a bohemian icon of the city. She worked prolifically for six decades across a range of media and is represented in many state and regional collections. \\n\\nIn the mid-1960s Lazar Krum took several portraits of Mora and her family at her studio/home on Collins Street. In this image, Mora poses before a mural of her characteristic softly rounded, angelic figures, her eyes opened wide in playful mimicry of their unblinking gaze. Photographer Krum suggests the image 'has captured Mirka, in the midst of her iconic faces, caught between both the delightful and ominous nature of her life experience'.",

Actually my drawings are like living dreams. Sometimes they appear very incoherent but I know that all this incoherence, if I search in it the truth is there. Each drawing has a very strong meaning. It as if my unconscious â€“ or subconscious â€“ would want to become conscious. Each drawing is a riddle which I have to decipher, and this is why I can never, I will never stop drawing because the answers of the riddles always come, sooner or later.\\n\\nWhen I was expecting my third child I was drawing my little people all the time. Sometimes Iâ€™d draw little animals too, but they have human legs or they have human arms. This goes back far away in the history of art, of course, Iâ€™m aware of that, but itâ€™s a truth and it travels all through time and it comes and visits some artists from time to time. Must be that little beast weâ€™ve got inside us, thatâ€™s what it is. Anyhow, when I was expecting my third child, all my little drawings had four toes, and everybody used to say, â€˜Why do you do four toes? You know a foot has five toesâ€™, and I said, â€˜Well, my people have four toes, you know, I canâ€™t help it, my hand does it. Iâ€™m not thinking about it. It just has to have four toes because when I feel the foot it just comes out with four toesâ€™. And when my baby came out, he was born, it had one foot with four toes.\\n\\nSo you can see what faith I have in my work. The truth is inside you always and you have to find it.",

The following year she was diagnosed with Friedreich's Ataxia, a rare and terminal degenerative disease of the nervous system for which there is no cure. She began using a wheelchair in 1996 when she was twenty-six. In 1997 she was nominated as NSW Young Australian of the Year for her work in establishing the Theresa Byrnes Foundation to raise money for research into the disease. After publishing her autobiography _The Divine Mistake_ in 1999, she moved to New York the following year, where she has lived ever since. Byrnes regularly exhibits her paintings in New York, Washington, London and Sydney, and received the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Artist Grant for her painting in 2003 and 2006. Best known for her provocative performance works, she uses her whole body to create edgy artworks using materials such as diesel, ink and mud.\\n\\nPhotographer Greg Weight took this image for the cover of Byrnes' autobiography. In his book _Australian Artists_, Weight described Byrnes as 'a woman with a mission â€¦ determined to fulfil her life's purpose and her ambition as an artist while she is still able'.",

She is probably the best-known Utopia artist after her late aunt, Emily Kame Kngwarreye. Petyarre first gained recognition for her batiks, exhibiting from 1977 with the Utopia Women's Silk Batik Group. Although she only began painting in acrylics on canvas in the late 1980s, since her first solo exhibition in 1991 she has had a dedicated following of public and private collectors in Australia and internationally. Using layers of tapering dots, dashes and swirling lines, her many paintings portray Awelye (women's ceremonies and body paint designs) and various Dreamings, including the Mountain Devil Lizard and her signature, Bush Medicine Leaves. Petyarre was awarded the Wynne Prize at the Art Gallery of NSW in 1999 for one of her _Leaves_ works, the first Aboriginal artist to receive this coveted award for landscape painting.\\n\\nFor the exhibition and book _Studio: Australian Painters Photographed by R. Ian Lloy_d (2007), art critic John McDonald and National Geographic photographer Lloyd travelled 50,00 km around Australia over three years. This photograph shows Petyarre painting in a shed in Alice Springs. Lloyd and McDonald watched her, seemingly 'completely unflappable', as she applied layer upon layer of tapering dots with patient repetitive strokes, making another of the many paintings with which she has long helped to support her relatives in Utopia.",

In Melbourne, he and his pub band The Dots made two albums before breaking up in 1982. He recorded Post in Sydney in 1985, but his major break came the following year, by which time his band was known as The Coloured Girls. Their double album Gossip was one of the biggest Australian records of the year. The band made Under the Sun (1987) before touring the US as Paul Kelly and the Messengers. They disbanded in 1991, and from that point Kelly branched into producing and acting as well as writing and performing. Kelly sings with a marked Australian accent and many of his songs refer to specific Australian people and places. Though he has written most of his long and poetic songlist alone, over the course of his nineteen albums has also collaborated brilliantly, particularly with indigenous performers such as Kev Carmody, Christine Anu and Yothu Yindi. His self-described 'mongrel memoir', How to Make Gravy, was released in 2010. \\n\\nKelly has written many songs about Melbourne, where Martin Philbey photographed him at Flinders Street Station.",

McAllister was the Australian Ballet's artistic director and lived in Melbourne; Enoch was in either Sydney or Brisbane, as the director of the Sydney Festival, and as the director of the Queensland Theatre Company before that. But they maintained a policy of phoning one another daily, and of never going more than three weeks without seeing each other â€“ somewhere. Peter Brew-Bevan wanted his portrait of them to capture this together-but-apart aspect of their relationship, while at the same time telling of 'their very strong bond and love for each other'. This is suggested by their poses and body language: seated together but looking away from each other and connected only through their hands. The composition is partly inspired by paintings by Edward Hopper as well as some of David Hockney's 1970s portraits, wherein couples are shown in simultaneous attitudes of isolation and intimacy. The retro hotel room setting further signifies lives spent in separate cities and on the road, and alludes to collective experiences of disconnection and separation during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The esky in which McAllister appears to be icing his foot symbolises his 'hard physical commitment and dedication to dance, spending pretty much every night with his feet in ice', while Wesley's t-shirt is a statement of his pride as a Noonuccal Nuugi man and his uncompromising advocacy for First Nations culture and creativity. \\n\\nThe 2021 Sydney Festival marked the end of Enoch's tenure as festival director. McAllister left the Australian Ballet in late 2020 after almost 40 years with the company. 'I have Wesley by my side,' he wrote at the time, 'and I'm looking forward to us becoming old men together.'",

Dad was an accountant, Mum was my mum and I have brothers and sisters that there's no artistic sort of dance background in our family at all. So, I was this sort of mutant child who, you know, used to dance around the house all the time and I used to dance in front of the TV when the TV was off so I could see myself, you know, moving around. And whenever there was a family gathering, I was always putting on a show and annoying the hell out of everyone. So, I guess it was in my DNA and I didn't really have a plan B. Iâ€™d started training when I was seven. I didn't realize that all the other boys at school wouldn't think it was quite as cool as what I did. So, that was, a life journey. But yeah, I just love to dance. And I guess ballet, because I saw some ballet on TV, which was Rudolf Nureyev doing Don Quixote with the Australian Ballet. And I went, Oh, that's the sort of dance I want to do. And then I went to a ballet school and 10 years later I was in Melbourne at the Australian Ballet School. And two years later I joined the company.\\n\\nI've got to say the first time I saw that portrait, I was just in awe really. I'd seen all of the preparatory work that Peter had done through his journals and diaries and things, and he talked a lot about it. So, I guess I knew that the dance element would be as it was, and it was incredibly beautiful. But I had no idea of what I'd look like. And it was really, really amazing. He caught a moment that sort of not, I guess what people would think necessarily is a former dancer and, a, you know, artistic director, because we tend to be on, you know, sort of like â€˜Welcome to the balletâ€™. And it was sort of more of a pensive moment. And I really liked that â€™cos, you know, I feel like it's the side of me that sometimes people don't get to see.

He moved at the age of four to Australia, where his parents worked as caterers on TV and movie sets. His big-screen debut came in _The Crossing_ (1990), in which he coâ€“starred with future wife Danielle Spencer. He won AFI awards for his work in _Proof_ (1991) and _Romper Stomper_ (1992), and played Jack Thompsonâ€™s gay son in _The Sum of Us_ (1994). The following year he moved to Hollywood to make _The Quick and the Dead_ (1995); soon after, he drew rave reviews as the brooding Bud White in _LA Confidential_ (1997). _The Insider_ (1999), _Gladiator_ (2000), and _A Beautiful Mind_ (2001) earned him three consecutive Best Actor Oscar nominations; he won for _Gladiator_ (and took out the Golden Globe for _A Beautiful Mind_). Following the noble _Master and Commander_, Crowe dominated a series of tough action dramas, including _Cinderella Man_ (2004), _3:10 to Yuma_ (2007), _American Gangster_ (2007) and _Body of Lies_ (2008). He returned to historical costume for _Robin Hood_ (2010), _Les MisÃ©rables_ (2012) and the Biblical epic _Noah_ (2014) before the release of his directorial debut, _The Water Diviner_. His most recent role is as manipulative American media executive Roger Ailes in the miniseries _The Loudest Voice_ (2019). Partâ€“owner of the South Sydney Rabbitohs since 2006, he commutes regularly between the USA, the north coast of NSW and Sydney. \\n\\nStuart Spenceâ€™s portrait of Crowe was shot in 1995 at Croweâ€™s local pub, located 300 metres from where he was living in Sydney at the time. Crowe commissioned the image himself, at a time when celebrities were encouraged to provide their own approved publicity material to the press. Spence had worked with Crowe previously on a magazine shoot where the pair had, in Spenceâ€™s words, â€˜got on like a house on fireâ€™. The portrait of the young actor swinging on his chair was taken around the time he made his debut in Hollywood, and his career could tip either way. Although he enjoyed photographing Crowe, himself, Spence said â€˜Russell had a reputation at that time for doing some pretty left field things on photo shoots, to the point where many photographers were deeply on edge if they had to shoot him.â€™",

Apart from his flirty smile and sexy moustache, off the court Newcombe was known for enjoying and inciting beer-fuelled hijinks (his drinking bout with George Bush Jr. led to the future president's arrest for drunk driving). In 1994 he assumed the captaincy of Australia's Davis Cup team in partnership with Tony Roche, and became a mentor to a new generation of Australian players like Pat Rafter and Lleyton Hewitt. Having led the team to victory in 1999 against France, Newcombe stepped down from the captaincy. He continues to work as a commentator and after-dinner speaker.",

She was well-known on the Sydney post-war art scene and her portrait was painted by both Russell Drysdale and William Dobell. Dobellâ€™s portrait of Olley, dressed in a gown fashioned from surplus wartime parachute silk, won the 1948 Archibald Prize. Olley held her first one-person show that year. It was a sell-out, and from that beginning, she held at least one solo exhibition annually. In 1991 she reprised her success of 43 years before, when a show of 35 of her intimate, brilliantly-coloured interiors and still lifes sold out again. The Art Gallery of New South Wales held a major retrospective show of her long career in 1996â€“1997. Her work is represented in the National Gallery of Australia; all State galleries; and numerous regional, corporate and private collections. In 1990, she endowed the Margaret Hannah Olley Art Trust, which has funded acquisitions by many Australian institutions including the National Portrait Gallery. Remaining one of Sydneyâ€™s most recognisable arts identities, Olley was again the subject of an Archibald Prize-winning portrait, this time by Ben Quilty, in 2011. She and Morley were introduced to each other by Barry Humphries, and became close friends.",

She married in England in 1929 and with her husband became co-director and designer for Pellier Ltd, a fashionable Mayfair dress salon. In 1949 she returned to Australia. After ten years of painting and exhibiting, she established a wallpaper business in Sydney. Finding the monochromatic, muted tonings that Australians favoured for interiors insufficiently vigorous to 'withstand modern living', she began producing vibrant oversized prints. The Broadhurst Design Collection had grown to some 800 patterns when Broadhurst was murdered in October 1977 (the case has never been solved). More than 500 examples have been revived by Signature Prints, a Sydney business marketing Broadhurst wallpaper, textiles and art, and the designs have been archived by the Powerhouse Museum.",

The first of her many cookbooks, _The Margaret Fulton Cookbook_, was published in 1968. It sold more than a million copies and remains a staple in many kitchens around the country. In 1999 she published _I Sang for My Supper_. Part forthright memoir, part social history, the book documents her life and the changing social and cultural scene in Australia from the 1920s to the eve of the 21st century. Fulton was a Living National Treasure, and in 2006 she was named one of the one hundred most influential Australians by the _Bulletin_. _Margaret Fultonâ€™s Kitchen_ (2007) and the revised edition of the _Margaret Fulton Cookbook_ (2010) brought together recipes devised over her career as a cook and writer, and she lived to see _Margaret Fulton Christmas_ become available as an iPhone app. Her daughter and granddaughters are food writers.",

It measures: 36.1 cm by 28.5.\\n\\nMargaret stands at a table covered by beautifully presented food. She smiles directly at the camera from the corner of a warmly lit dining room. Behind her are floor to ceiling curtains, drawn closed, bearing a repeat print motif of a small blue flower on a beige background. \\n\\nAt a right angle to the curtain is a recessed pine cabinet with glass doors. Margaret stands in front of the cabinets four shelves displaying blue and white china plates and bowls. On our right, a speckled brown marble fireplace and perched on the mantle is an arrangement of apricot and white roses in a silver bowl. Above the mantelpiece and against the beige wall is a framed, bold, black and white abstract, geometric art-work. \\n\\nMargaret is a full-figured, short-haired, smiling middle-aged woman and she stands behind a table laden with delicious-looking food and snacks. \\n\\nShe has an oval shaped face with a warm, light complexion and laugh-lines around her eyes. Her thick, red hair parts across her forehead. Subtle makeup highlights her brown eyes and eyebrows and soft red lipstick rims her open-mouthed smile. \\n\\nShe wears a brown beaded necklace with a fan shaped black and gold statement pendant, it stands out against her plain, beige, short-sleeved top and tightly pleated, flared skirt. At waist level, and as if about to lift and offer it to us, she holds the rim of a large silver platter of fruit on the table in front of her. \\n\\nThe pale-wood table is laden with tiered, edible arrangements; devilled eggs, roast meat, vegetables, salad, cheeses, brandy snaps, pastries, cake and strawberries.\\n\\nAmongst the bounty of food there are flowers, a blue and white china tureen with its lid on, crystal wine glasses and a silver candelabra with three tall white unlit candles.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Annette Twyman and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

At sixteen she auditioned successfully for a role in the Australian production of the musical _Hair_, and has lived in this country ever since. (Auditioning the same week, her cousin, Donna Summer, scored a role in the German production of _Hair_.) In 1972 Hines began a two-year stint as Mary Magdalene in _Jesus Christ Superstar_ â€“ of Jamaican heritage, she was the first black actress in the world to play the part. Two years later she embarked on a successful solo singing career that produced such hits as â€˜I Just Donâ€™t Know What to do With Myself, â€˜Youâ€™ and â€˜Somethingâ€™s Missing in My Lifeâ€™ and saw her crowned Australiaâ€™s Queen of Pop in 1976, 1977 and 1978. Hines had a seven-year run as the kindest of the judges on televisionâ€™s _Australian Idol_ from 2003 to 2009. Her more than twenty albums include the recent _Life_ (2007), _Marcia Sings Tapestry_ (2010) and _Amazing_ (2014). Inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2007, from 2015 she appeared to sensational effect in a hit fringe stage production, _Velvet_, which she co-created. Over 2018 she is performing with other big names from the Australian music scene of the 1970s in the APIA Good Times Tour. \\n\\nLewis Morley (1925â€“2013), photographer, was born in Hong Kong and went to the United Kingdom with his family at the end of World War II. He went to art school in London and spent time in Paris before taking up photography in 1954, initially working for magazines like Tatler and She. In 1961, he founded Lewis Morley Studios and built his reputation through photographs of the celebrities that defined the hip spirit of London in the 1960s, but is perhaps most famous for his 1963 image of call-girl and model, Christine Keeler, taken at the height of the Profumo Affair. In the early 1970s he emigrated to Australia, and went on to take many photographs for Dolly, POL, Belle and other publications. The National Portrait Gallery, London, held a retrospective of his work in 1989; and the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra presented Lewis Morley: Myself and Eye, in 2003.",

By 1903 she was installed in his studio rooms in Rowe Street, Sydney, as his model and lover, and in 1912 she moved with him to the property near Springwood in the Blue Mountains which became their home for much of the next 60 years. They married in 1920. Rose continued as Lindsay's principal model, becoming possibly the most frequently painted woman in the history of Australian art.

With Roberts, McCubbin and Charles Conder, Streeton was a core member of the group of artists known as the 'Heidelberg School'. In 1897, after several years in Sydney, moved to London with the photographer Walter Barnett and his wife. Streeton spent most of the next 25 years in Europe, working for some time as an official Australian war artist in France, and serving alongside Roberts and other expatriate Australians in the Royal Army Medical Corps at the 3rd London General Hospital at Wandsworth. He married the Canadian violinist Nora Clench (1867â€“1938) in 1908. Barnett later photographed the couple at their St John's Wood home in England. Some years after the end of the war, in 1923, the Streetons returned to Australia, settling near Melbourne.",

He studied documentary photography with the Magnum photographer David Hurn, and has worked as a photojournalist for the Sydney Morning Herald.",

I couldnâ€™t do it now if I tried! And at that time, Dame Nellie Melba was visiting home and she saw this picture, and she thought it showed great talent and sheâ€™d wanted to give me something to remember her by and her recognition of me. And she gave me my first palette, and that started me off on oil painting, which I really wanted to do. And Iâ€™m still painting on this palette today.\\n\\nI like painting flowers direct. I like to gather a bunch in my hand in the garden, put them in a setting that enhances them, and to paint direct, to get the whole feeling of the bunch in the round.\\n\\nFlowers have always had that fascination for me, because I can remember when I was a war artist right up in the steaming jungle of New Guinea. Iâ€™d arranged myself a beautiful native bowl full of flowers and I was sitting in the mess, painting this, when I had a signal to be moved on down to Lae, and I ignored the signal, and the jeep came along to collect me to take me to the airport, and I said, â€˜Go away, Iâ€™m in the middle of painting flowersâ€™, and I continued with my flowers and got into hot water over this. The signals flew from New Guinea to Melbourne and back, and I was still painting my flowers, refusing to budge.\\n\\nI recall that picture and sticking it out, and I remember painting it on the mess table; I had to move every time a meal was brought forward, and it took me about four or five days to complete it, and Iâ€™ve kept that canvas, I called it _The Flower Sip_ and itâ€™s one picture that didnâ€™t go into the Military History Section. I felt I deserved that one.",

                    "transcript": "This photograph is titled Nora Heysen with her dog, sitting outside her home, Hunters Hill, Sydney and was taken of the painter by Sage, in 2000. The portrait is a gelatin silver photograph in sepia tones, measuring 25.5cm tall by 21cm wide.\\n\\nThe photograph reveals a few details of Nora Heysenâ€™s home exterior. Nora is positioned a few metres from the viewer. Clouded eyes peer from a delicate face and her slight, ageing figure is bent in her chair. She holds a cigarette in one hand, her left foot rests lightly on the back of an elderly, black and white border collie-cross at her feet.\\n\\nBehind Nora, white, horizontal weatherboards rising up out of view and shimmering garden reflections in a four-pained glass window. On the windowsill, are a collection of ornaments, a candle the shape of a butternut pumpkin, a tall metal tea kettle. More things are arranged on a small wooden table to the right of the scene, inclusive of her ashtray. \\n\\nIn front of the side table, her dog, sitting upright on cement floor bearing signs of heavy use and on our right, so close to the foreground its edges blur, is the corner of a larger table covered in a white cloth.\\n\\nNoraâ€™s slight form is the centre of the image. Her head is at an angle, light washing out the left side of her face, lined skin on her right, caught by the light. Noraâ€™s tall, white hair is swept untidily back from her face, sitting up high off her forehead, tucked behind her ears, fine wisps escaping. Her brow is raised, traversed by three deep lines, her short, shapely grey eyebrows slanting up. Noraâ€™s eyes are deep-set, heavy lidded, gazing towards us. Two creases join her nose to the outer corners of her mouth. Her lips are closed, her jaw relaxed her expression unreadable. Noraâ€™s light skin at her neck droops from beneath her chin into the open collar of her light coloured shirt.\\n\\nThe shirt, and all of Noraâ€™s clothing is simple and loose fitting. Her dark waistcoat, in wide ribbed corduroy, is undone, three metallic buttons gleam, spaced along the left edge; at the hip is a pocket, with a pale triangle of fabric nosing out. Noraâ€™s thin legs are encased in trousers of the same wide ribbed corduroy as the waistcoat, but in a lighter shade.\\n\\nNora is sitting on a folded crochet blanket on the seat of a plain, angular, wooden chair; its surface scratched and pitted, in patches, the dark varnish has worn away. Her shoulders are rounded forward, her body bowed to her right. Both elbows lean on either arm of the chair; her right arm propped up, with a smoldering cigarette held between her fore and middle fingers, while the left hand dangles towards her lap, palm down, fingers curled.\\n\\nNoraâ€™s knees are slightly apart and in its pale leather shoe, her left foot rests possessively on her chubby, tired dogâ€™s thick black and white coat.\\n\\nThe collie is grey around its muzzle, eyes and ears. Its left eye is milky white, reflecting the light. The dogâ€™s front legs are outstretched, white paws with black sleeves and it rests side on to Nora.\\n\\nRunning from the wall of the house in the back of the portrait, to the foreground, two black lines; joins in the precast concrete floor, frame Nora Heysen and her dog in the scene.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Lucie Shawcross and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

But, I mean, you donâ€™t ever come out with anything fresh or marvellous, it always seems ghastly when it goes up on the wall, and maybe it is.\\n\\nI hope itâ€™s becoming less taped, or typed. Not meant to be a pun, but anyway, I think thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d prefer to be happening, that itâ€™s becoming just as much mine, if I can make it that way, but much less typed in the sense that it would be, well, â€˜thatâ€™s Australianâ€™, or â€˜that comes from Melbourne, that comes from Ballarat, thatâ€™s where â€¦â€™. Iâ€™d like it to be much more a universal sort of thing. I donâ€™t mean necessarily the painting to look as if it could be done anywhere, but just that it would be much more like good painting rather than like something that comes from somewhere.",

After a national number one hit, 'Royal Telephone', which sold over 75,000 copies, he became a household name and was named Pop Star of the Year in 1964. His profile continued to grow through TV appearances, radio airplay and regular tours around Australia. In the 1980s, Little began working at the Eora Centre in Redfern, becoming a role model and mentor for Indigenous youth. In a characteristically low-key resurgence, he won an ARIA Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album in 1999 for _Messenger_. The same year, he was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and was named Best Male Artist at the Deadly Awards. He founded the Jimmy Little Foundation in 2006 to improve renal health in Indigenous communities. Little won a Golden Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival in 2011.\\n\\nIn 2003 the National Portrait Gallery exhibited Juno Gemes' solo show _Proof: Portraits from the Movement 1978â€“2003_.

In 2017, she became only the second woman of colour to model bridal gowns for Chanel. The following year she featured in the Pirelli calendar, and made 33 appearances at Paris Fashion Week. She was selected by the Duchess of Sussex to feature in British _Vogueâ€™s_ 'Forces for Change' edition in 2019, which profiled her activism on humanitarian issues, the rights of asylum seekers, and racial and gender equality. \\n\\nCharles Dennington's portrait of Akech was originally taken for the December 2018 issue of _Vogue Australia_. Dennington discussed plans for the shoot with Akech in advance, giving him a deeper insight into the model's personal life.

His early plays premiered at alternative theatres in Melbourne â€“ _The Coming of Stork_ (1970) and _The Removalists_ (1971) at Betty Burstallâ€™s La Mama, and _Donâ€™s Party_ (1971) at the Pram Factory in Carlton, home to the Australian Performing Group. Later, Williamson based himself in Sydney, recalling his Melbourne experiences as unhappy. From the outset, Williamson aimed to â€˜get our own stories on stage, spoken in our own accents, reflecting our own lifeâ€™. His plays, many of which he has scripted for films, include _The Department_, _The Club_, _Travelling North_, _The Perfectionist_, _Emerald City_, _Brilliant Lies_, _Dead White Males_, _Heretic_ and _Up for Grabs_. His film credits include _Stork_ (1971), _Petersen_ (1974), _Gallipoli_ (1980), _The Year of Living Dangerously_ (1981) (the latter two collaborations with Peter Weir), _Phar Lap_ (1982) and _On the Beach_ (2000). Critics have carped about his works as they have accreted, but for decades he has been Australiaâ€™s best-known and most prolific playwright and he is unlikely to be eclipsed as the writer of many of the top box-office performers in Australian theatre history. \\n\\nGordon Glenn (b. 1948) worked as an assistant cameraman on the television show _Homicide_ before becoming the stills photographer for the pioneering Australian journal _Cinema Papers_. He worked for the magazine from 1968 to the mid-70s, documenting production on the sets of films such as _The Cars that Ate Paris_, _Between Wars_, _The True Story of Eskimo Nell_, _Caddie_, _Mad Dog Morgan_, _Donâ€™s Party_, and _The Picture Show Man_. He worked as a cinematographer on a number of independent films before moving to directing and producing feature films and television specials. In 2001 he produced the highly-acclaimed feature film _Yolngu Boy_ (2001). This photograph accompanied an interview with Williamson in _Cinema Papers_ of January 1974.",

I think I know what Iâ€™m doing now.\\n\\nI basically start from a situation and the characters in the situation. My plays are plays about character rather than plays about theme. I donâ€™t start off with a thesis and construct a play around that thesis, I start off with characters and try and follow the logical paths that those characters would follow in the play. So, sometimes I start with an outline. _What If You Died Tomorrow?_ started with a fairly close three-page outline. Sometimes, I â€“ as in _The Removalists_ â€“ I start from the situation and see where that situation leads. _The Department_: the very first rough draft started from a listing of the topics on the agenda. The latest play, _A Handful of Friends_, started from an initial scene. So, I havenâ€™t got a clear-cut way of going about it, except that the first draft is invariably the biro-written one, very very rough and I expect it to be. Iâ€™d rather be fluent and let it all come out in that first draft and then refine and refine later on.\\n\\nWhen youâ€™re writing from character, some of itâ€™s intuitive. You just feel I know, I know my character well enough now, I know what heâ€™ll do in a situation, I know how heâ€™ll react. You keep referring back to reality to try and get a check on the types of behaviour, you say, â€˜Now when I was in that situation, or when Fred was in that situation, what sort of way did they react to this?â€™, and so you keep referring back, but essentially, once your characters are under way, you just intuitively feel them and what theyâ€™ll do.\\n\\nSometimes the structure grows, I suppose the word is â€˜organicallyâ€™.\\n\\nI love watching political processes at work, I really love watching power struggles and the way people use language as an instrument of power, as an instrument to gain power, prestige, status, love, whatever they want out of life. Iâ€™m primarily interested in the way people relate to each other and use language to do it.",

After graduating he went overseas, spending two years working as an editor in Nigeria before returning to London and a role with the British Film Institute. His first feature films _The Adventures of Barry McKenzie_ (1972) and _Barry McKenzie Holds his Own_ (1974) â€“ both collaborations with Barry Humphries â€“ achieved box-office success but were sourly received by critics. Regardless, they signalled Beresfordâ€™s emergence as a key figure in Australia's film renaissance, and he then cemented his standing with _Don's Party_ (1976), _The Getting of Wisdom_ (1977), _Breaker Morant_ (1980), _The Club_ (1980) and _Puberty Blues_ (1981). His debut Hollywood feature, _Tender Mercies_ (1983) earned him an Oscar nomination for best director. His 1989 film _Driving Miss Daisy_ won four Academy Awards, including best picture â€“ although Beresford himself was overlooked for nomination in the direction category. Subsequent projects include the films _Black Robe_ (1991); _Last Dance_ (1996); _Paradise Road_ (1997); _Maoâ€™s Last Dancer_ (2009) and _Ladies in Black_ (2018), and the TV miniseries _Bonnie and Clyde_ (2013) and _Roots_ (2016).",

Of Dunghutti descent, they were born at Burnt Ridge, near Kempsey, and took up boxing in emulation of their father, grandfather and a great-uncle, who'd had some success as fighters. They adopted the surname Sands as a tribute to a local boxing fan and railway worker who'd allowed Percy (1921â€“1974) â€“ who boxed under the name Ritchie Sands â€“ to jump a train to a fight in Newcastle in 1939. The brothers claimed numerous victories in a period spanning 20 years, notching up 607 bouts between them and winning a third of that total by knockout. Clem (1917â€“1989) held the NSW welterweight title from 1947 to 1951; Alfie (1929â€“1985) was the NSW middleweight champion from 1952 to 1954; while George (1924â€“1986) won 55 of his 101 fights. The most successful of the sextet, Dave (1926-1952), claimed his first belts in 1946, winning the Australian middleweight and light heavyweight titles. He took out the British Empire middleweight boxing title in 1949; and in 1950 held the Australian middle, light heavyweight and heavyweight titles simultaneously. In all, Dave won 97 of his 110 professional bouts and at the time of his death, aged 26, was ranked number three in the world. Dave's death inspired the youngest brother, Russell (1937-1977) to succeed in the ring. He won the state and national featherweight titles in 1954 and retired in 1959 having won 35 of his 58 fights.",

He and Valerie, also a winner of several Australian spearfishing and scuba titles, met in the late 1950s and married in 1963, by which time their first major documentary _The Shark Hunters_ had been sold to Australian and American television. They formed their own production company in 1969, the year they were consultants for the US feature film _Blue Water, White Death_. Throughout the 70s, 80s and 90s they created footage for numerous films and television programs, including the live shark underwater scenes for the Steven Spielberg blockbuster _Jaws_ (1975). Vigorous and successful campaigners for marine conservation, they received many prestigious awards for their environmental work and underwater photography, their images appearing in magazines such as _National Geographic_ and _Time_. Valerie's work continued following her husband's death from cancer in 2012.\\n\\nThis photograph is thought to have been taken near Norfolk Island by the skipper of the boat on which the couple is pictured.",

The only Australian to win gold on the track at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games (with four medals), she lit the flame at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Paralympic Games in 2000, and went on to win two gold medals and one silver. She also won gold in demonstration events at the Atlanta and Sydney Olympics. She has set five world records and gained eleven world championships, and won the women's wheelchair division of the Boston Marathon four times. Sauvage was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2007, Australian Paralympic Hall of Fame in 2011 and named a Sport Australia Hall of Fame Legend in 2019. Now a sports coach and motivational speaker, Sauvage stresses that 'you never know what you can achieve until you try'.\\n\\nCanadian-born team Denis Montalbetti and Gay Campbell are renowned for their portraiture, particularly their photographs of athletes.

Settling in Melbourne, he opened a workshop in St Kilda, and rapidly established a reputation for the superb construction of his custom-made modern furniture. Credited with elevating his craft to the level of an art, he was the subject of several one-man exhibitions in his lifetime, and his work now figures in the permanent collections of several major Australian galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of South Australia and the Powerhouse Museum. His woodwork adorns the chapel of St Mary's college at the University of Melbourne.",

By 1967, he was in a position to open the Joseph Brown Gallery in Collins Street, Melbourne, at which he frequently showed mixed exhibitions of contemporary Australian art. Over time, Brown built up one of the finest private art collections in Australia, and made such substantial contributions to Australian art history that he was awarded three honorary doctorates. In 2004 the National Gallery of Victoria accepted Brown's gift of some 160 works from his collection, valued at $35 million; two hundred more works, of similar value, were auctioned.",

The son of a country policeman, Brown studied medicine at Sydney University and in 1972 moved to Tasmania, where he worked as a general practitioner in Launceston. His passion for the Tasmanian wilderness was sparked by a rafting trip down the Franklin River in 1976, the same year that he became a founding member of the Wilderness Society. From then until 1983 he famously led the campaign against proposed dam-works on the Franklin, during which he was arrested and gaoled. The river was subsequently preserved with a World Heritage Listing. In 1983, he began a decade in the Tasmanian House of Assembly as the Member for Denison. He was elected to the Federal Senate as a member of the Tasmanian Greens in 1996 and later joined West Australian Greens Senator Dee Margetts in founding the Australian Greens. At the 2001 Federal election Brown was re-elected to the Senate with a greatly increased vote. By the time he retired from politics in April 2012, he had overseen the emergence of the Greens from a fringe to a mainstream political force. Brown remains one of the most-recognised Australian political figures, known for his outspokenness on the environment as well as human rights and social justice issues. His memoir _Memo for a saner world_ was published in 2004.",

Making many key images exploring womenâ€™s everyday lives and the politics of representation in the 1970s, during the late 1980s Ford became increasingly interested in indigenous issues, race, representation and colonisation. \\n\\nIn 1988, Sue Ford attended the Barunga festival of culture and sports. The then prime minister, Bob Hawke, and Aboriginal affairs minister Gerry Hand visited the festival to meet with senior Aboriginal men. They included Gamatj clan leader YunupiÅ‹u AM (1948-2023), who had known Hawke for years. YunupiÅ‹u had helped his father, Mungurrawuy YunupiÅ‹u, draft the famous Bark Petition of 1963 to Federal Parliament, launching the first native title case in Australia. In 1968 when the Yolgnu obtained writs against Nabalco Corporation, YunupiÅ‹u acted as court interpreter in the Gove Land Case. He became chairman of the Northern Land Council in 1977 and was the key negotiator for the Mirrar people in the Ranger uranium mine deal, securing the lease for Kakadu National Park in November 1978. For this he was named Australian of the Year for 1978 (his brother, Mandawuy YunupiÅ‹u AC, was Australian of the Year for 1993). With other senior Aboriginal leaders including Wenten Rubuntja, in 1988 he drew up and presented to Bob Hawke another bark petition â€“ the Barunga Statement, bearing a written proposal for Aboriginal self-determination. Hawke hung it in Parliament House on his last day in office. YunupiÅ‹u's is the voice chanting in Yolngu-Matha language on the hit song 'Treaty', an attempt to hold the government to account over its promise for a treaty by 1990. There are photographs of YunupiÅ‹u at separate meetings over decades with Malcolm Fraser, Paul Keating, Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott. He wrote a brilliant if dispiriting essay, 'Tradition, Truth and Tomorrow' for the _Monthly_ magazine of December-January 2008-2009, recounting the meeting with Hawke, other such 'historic' meetings, and their negligible outcomes.",

His first book of short stories, Bleak Rooms, was published in 1988 and his debut novel, _Maestro_ (1989), was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award. Subsequent works include the novels _Honk If You Are Jesus_ (1992); _Wish_ (1995); _Three Dog Night_ (2003), which won the Christina Stead Award; _Everything I Knew_ (2008); and _Minotaur_ (2019).

She became a member of Brisbane's literary circle, joining the writers' group 'Barjai' which included Judith Wright and Thea Astley. In 1950 she was diagnosed with optic atrophy; she was declared blind by the age of 22. Moving to Sydney to study, she met artist Charles Blackman. After they married in 1952, they moved to Melbourne, where Blackman associated with the avant-garde group centered around the Melbourne Contemporary Art Society, including Arthur Boyd, Fred Williams, Joy Hester, John and Sunday Reed, Clifton Pugh, John Perceval and Leonard French. In the 1960s the Blackmans were part of the Australian push active in London. While muse to her husband, Blackman also worked as a magazine columnist, a radio-producer for Radio for the Print-Handicapped, and an interviewer for the National Library's oral history program. Blackman published her autobiography Glass after Glass in 1997, and Portrait of a Friendship, which drew on her correspondence with Judith Wright, in 2007. In between, she purchased her husband's painting The Family, showing her 'good dear beloved long friend' Judith Wright, for the National Portrait Gallery.",

But somehow what his creations came out of â€“ a sort of a living or understanding of poetry â€“ was something that always bound us and still binds us together. But at that time when I recognised Charles as potentially a very great painter and a great creator, I relinquished my strong intentions of being a writer and although I went on writing diaries and sometimes poems and more and more I became a very prolific letter-writer as I gathered more and more interesting people as friends and we became more and more separated by distance, my writing changed course, as in fact my life had changed course to become devoted to Charlesâ€™ optimal putting forward of himself as a painter.\\n\\nYou know, when we married I said, â€˜Well if youâ€™re going to be a painter, youâ€™re going to paint, youâ€™re not going to go out and get a job doing something or another,â€™ so he stayed home and painted. And by this time my eyesight had failed almost altogether and I was on a blind pension, so we had that as a basis to live on. And the only thing I could really do was to work as an artistâ€™s model, as a nude model, which in fact I quite enjoyed because I was picking up a lot of information about painting. Itâ€™s quite an elegant job in its way, being a model, because one can decide oneâ€™s own poses and itâ€™s a very private occupation. One can have oneâ€™s own thoughts and one has the satisfaction of knowing oneâ€™s doing a job well.",

In 1972 she became the first woman presenter on _Four Corners_ â€“ an appointment which made headlines and prompted offensive, patronising commentary on matters including her looks, marital status and tastes in interior decoration. She remained with _Four Corners_ for nine years during which she was also a presenter on ABC radio's _City Extra_. From 1987 to 1994 she presented _The Search for Meaning_ on Radio National, conducting many of the insightful and tactful interviews for which she became renowned and which resulted in the publication of four volumes of transcripts. For twenty years from 1996 she presented the weekly biographical television show _Australian Story_. A foundation member of the Australia Council for the Arts, she was a Reconciliation Ambassador for the Aboriginal Council for Reconciliation from 1998. Her book _An Authentic Life: Finding Meaning and Spirituality in Everyday Life_ (1998) was an Australian bestseller; and in 2009 she published _Through a Glass Darkly_, a powerful chronicle of her experience of the death of her father. She was a patron of the national mentoring and networking initiative, Women in Media, and many prominent Australian female journalists cite Jones as a role model and inspiration. Jones was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1988, won the Walkley Award for Outstanding Contribution to Journalism in 2013, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Sydney in 2017.\\n\\nDavid Campbell grew up on the New South Wales Central Coast and studied at the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education in Sydney in the 1970s. He only ever painted three portraits, each of which were Archibald finalists. His portrait of Jones resulted from many hours of studying and sketching her at work in the ABC studios and was a finalist in 1979. That year, when 22 windows of the Myer store in Sydney were filled with his abstract paintings, this portrait of Jones was among them.",

He taught at Williamstown and Collingwood technical schools and won the Herald art prize for graphics before transferring to the Department of Education, where he became a senior planning officer. He remained in the department until he retired in 1987, having encouraged the introduction of various facilities and innovations to new technical colleges in the state. He is represented in the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the National Portrait Gallery, which has two drawings he made of John Perceval in 1999.",

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Russell-Clarke became the first Australian television 'Celebrity Chef' with his program 'Come and Get It'. Televised in the early evenings as families were sitting down to dinner, the catchy theme song and simple, health conscious recipes became synonymous with the development of a uniquely Australian approach to cooking. Since retirement he has focused on his love of painting.",

And with cooking, you're doing the same thing; you're mucking around with form, texture, colour and shape.\\n\\nI started writing for television when television started. I noticed that the bloke in front of the camera got more money than the poor bugger that wrote the scripts. And so I decided to go from behind the camera to the front of the camera. I then realised that there were too many policemen on television and all sorts of other people that seemed to know what they were doing but there were no cooks. And a cook is what I am. I started cooking on television and the ABC said: no one will be interested. We did 900 shows before the ABC got bored.\\n\\nCooking is only supplying heat to food. The same as painting. Painting is supplying paint to a surface, whether it's a canvas or a piece of cardboard.\\n\\nDo what you want to do. Do what you think is right. And then you'll create your own style, and your own imagination, because cooking is not following a recipe book. Cooking is your imagination and painting is your imagination. So make sure you think about what you're doing.",

But after that period, I started to do performance pieces. My photography changed a bit because one of the things that I undertook was to photograph my own family which represented the Chinese in Australia. I claimed my heritage in the 80s because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged.\\n\\nAnd the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields in the place where my uncle had been shot. I somehow knew that this was an important event because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event. And that was a very important moment in my life. I kept doing self-portraits and Iâ€™ve done about 40 of them.\\n\\nGradually I evolved to tell my own story and just photograph things about my own life. Iâ€™m very happy that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so I feel that Iâ€™m living my art as well as my life. And so thatâ€™s very satisfying for me.\\n\\nI had to come to terms with being Chinese, being gay and just feeling comfortable as a human being. There are lots of people who arenâ€™t comfortable about that, still. And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. Thatâ€™s been my philosophy.",

It measures 108.5 cm high and 72.5 cm wide, with a 10 cm thick white picture mat and a thin pale wooden frame. \\n\\nA young black-haired boy stands posing, facing the camera open-mouthed with teeth exposed at the point of offering a smile. His whole body is in the frame, one arm up on his hip, the other resting on the handlebars of a small childrenâ€™s metal bike.\\n\\nThere is little fine detail in the photograph due to its graininess and its age. He stands on dark floorboards in front of some textured draped curtains. \\n\\nThe boy wears a white high-collared short-sleeved shirt with a knotted tie that has a blurred indecipherable symbol on its tip. His shirt tucks into white shorts which is held in place by a white belt. His knees are bare. He wears white socks and black gym shoes.\\n\\nFilling the surface of the boyâ€™s shirt and shorts is a handwritten passage in black ink. It begins at the collar, words curving to the collarâ€™s rounded shape. As each written line progresses, it widens out, following this same curve. The lines of text straighten out by the time the words travel over the boyâ€™s shorts.\\n\\nThe text passage is broken up by the blurred symbol on the boyâ€™s tie and lower down, words curve in and around where his small hand grasps the bikeâ€™s handlebars, near his hip.\\n\\nIn neat cursive hand the text reads: â€˜When I was about six years old one of the kids at school called me \"Ching Chong China man, born in a jar, Christened in a teapot, Ha Ha Ha. I had no idea what he was talking about but I knew from his expression that he was being horrible to me, so I went home to my mother and I said to her, \"Mum Iâ€™m not Chinese, am I?\" My mother said to me very sternly, \"Yes you are.\" Her tone was hard and it shocked me. I knew in this moment being Chinese was like a terrible curse and I could not rely on my mother for help. Or my brother who was four years older than me, very much more experienced in the world. He chimed in, \"And you better get used to it.\"\\n\\nThe words come to an end 2 inches before the hem of his shorts.\\n\\nAt the cuff of the boyâ€™s right short pant is a small purple ink stamp with neatly rendered Chinese characters inside a thin purple square. On the cuff of the boyâ€™s left short pant is written \"Self Portrait #2\" and in smaller handwriting, â€˜Photographer Unknown. William Yang. 1947.â€™, and in even smaller print underneath, â€˜2007, 5/30â€™.\\n\\nAudio description written and voiced by Kate Matthews",

But after that period, I started to do performance pieces. My photography changed a bit because one of the things that I undertook was to photograph my own family which represented the Chinese in Australia. I claimed my heritage in the 80s because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged.\\n\\nAnd the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields in the place where my uncle had been shot. I somehow knew that this was an important event because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event. And that was a very important moment in my life. I kept doing self-portraits and Iâ€™ve done about 40 of them.\\n\\nGradually I evolved to tell my own story and just photograph things about my own life. Iâ€™m very happy that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so I feel that Iâ€™m living my art as well as my life. And so thatâ€™s very satisfying for me.\\n\\nI had to come to terms with being Chinese, being gay and just feeling comfortable as a human being. There are lots of people who arenâ€™t comfortable about that, still. And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. Thatâ€™s been my philosophy.",

His first major series of paintings, collectively titled Images of Modern Evil, was painted between 1945 and 1947. Tucker lived in Europe and the United States throughout the 1950s. There he refined and extended his subjects, concentrating on Australian myths, which he saw as central to the definition of national identity.",

I think itâ€™s answering an inner compulsion, because if I didnâ€™t find this particular form of activity â€“ to me itâ€™s one that is defining things to myself and defining myself â€“ Iâ€™m not quite sure what would happen to me if I didnâ€™t answer this kind of inner compulsion. And I suppose it relates to oneâ€™s attitude to life. I think that, despite all the negative and destructive powers that are constantly at work with us, that one is constantly striving to affirm life, to be in love with it, and these are the tokens of affection on our way, as it were.\\n\\nThe question of why I paint the particular things I do is also pretty ambiguous. I think I would say that Iâ€™m trying to exorcise my own particular devils, and I suppose some of them get into the painting. I hope they do, thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m trying to put them, and get rid of them.\\n\\nBut once out, of course, one can then feel this kind of relaxation, the affirmation flows in, and the devils in the painting can sometimes turn into angels.\\n\\nI suppose in the act of work that it is essentially a struggle to escape the enmeshment of oneâ€™s ego, and in the attempt to struggle free one seems externally, to the external world, to be a very egocentric person, because youâ€™re following a necessary compulsion without which one loses oneâ€™s own balance and direction in life; and in the act of working one is defining these shapes, ejecting them as it were, and getting rid of them; and this process of ejectment is one there which is defining and clarifying oneâ€™s own particular kind of energy which you are attempting to flow out into life.",

                    "transcript": "Sometime in the thirties, I canâ€™t quite remember when, I began to see some very small black and white reproductions of the first surrealist shows in Europe; they just began to trickle out in magazines and articles, and a friend in London sent out something about it, a catalogue with some photographs, and from that moment on I knew this was the sort of art that really fascinated me, something that opened up a world of the imagination and got away from the sort of surface realities of life, which even at that stage I felt to be only a superficial part of life. With this new vision of what reality could mean, I began to become really seriously interested in art.\\n\\nThat was my first real understanding of the significance of art as a way of coming to grips with life, of understanding life; and that I think is the essential meaning of art. I donâ€™t feel itâ€™s a way of decorating a room, certainly not for an artist at any rate, itâ€™s a way of coming to grips with reality, a way of getting to know what you yourself are like or what the world around you is like. And it seemed to me that surrealism, as a theory at any rate, offered enormous scope, and I felt that with the Surrealists, that the world of seeming â€“ of things as they seem to be â€“ was not the true world at all; that in the subconscious mind there were all sorts of images, ideas which were a part of reality, and, as a painter, I tried to express this subconscious material, or some of the images from it, at any rate.",

                    "transcript": "Itâ€™s impossible to talk about art because Iâ€™ve always taken it for granted. Iâ€™ve always understood, basically, that I used to be something else, that Iâ€™m a continuation of a particular kind of thread of human spirit, that the only thing that Iâ€™m involved in is the notion of interpreting time, in a sense that Iâ€™m alive. That the spirit will continue and itâ€™ll be the same as what it was, and various painters have given their flash at it and that in a summary is basically what Iâ€™m doing. Along with that, is like, the immense sense of the requirement towards survival so one gets more interested in the capacity for power, or in the various ways that can be appropriated. And that art has to follow that, has to employ it, if itâ€™s of any value.\\n\\nThereâ€™s no such a thing as Australian art because thereâ€™s probably no such a thing as Australia. Thereâ€™s a kind of ancient piece of immense and interesting and very strange land, which has had a few people come down on it and in a very surreal way started a kind of sensual civilisation. Itâ€™s got to a kind of point where weâ€™re suffering like the rest of the world with a kind of paralysis of confidence.\\n\\nI think that humankind are trying to force and press open a new area of brain think â€“ a capacity to sense, a broader knowing. In order to do that weâ€™re going to have in Godâ€™s, or in the puzzleâ€™s term, some sort of a major reckoning up. Weâ€™ve got death absolutely in our hands, a complete capacity to bang it out, and weâ€™re trying to force open this newer channel. I see, to a certain degree, that I along with numbers of other individuals, are trying to, you know, cause inside their own pressure, that breaking through, that kind of time. I mean, thereâ€™s immense relaxation inside it, but thereâ€™s also like the heat towards want, the necessity of the mystery of life, of the system of life, which is always, like, come and go.

Quite generally speaking, my works in oil are based on sketches â€“ vaguely based on sketches â€“ and come to life only while Iâ€™m in the process of execution. One must always leave â€“ I at least must always leave â€“ a certain element of ambiguity which appears in the work in mental process while youâ€™re at work. I love working from life, life drawings â€“ I do quite a number, and my life drawings very often donâ€™t have any close relationship to the work Iâ€™m doing based on those drawings. My subject matter is a very varied one, for the very reason that I consider art an adventure and any path I have trodden before seems to me very often used up, and I need to find a different stimulus and a different subject or combination of ideas.\\n\\nThe actual painting of a picture doesnâ€™t take long. Very often I may only spend an hour a day in actual execution of a painting; most of the time is spent just thinking about it, looking at the work, the stage in which the work is, and so drift, think and let things develop in my mind.",

After studying in Melbourne and winning many prizes and grants, from 1975 to 1983 he produced a series of cartoons attacking the Fraser government. After 1983 he began to paint more personal and emotionally-charged works, often incorporating a haunting â€˜solitary watcherâ€™. Some of his paintings of suburban and inner Melbourne now number amongst the defining images of the city. He is a regular exhibitor in the Wynne and Sulman Prizes, as well as the Archibald, in which he was a finalist nine times between 1976 and 2005. During the 1990s Amor was awarded several art residencies and worked in Barcelona, New York and London. In 1999, appointed Australiaâ€™s first official war artist since Vietnam, he travelled to East Timor to record the reconstruction efforts of peacekeepers. The resulting works are in the collection of the Australian War Memorial. Although he describes himself as an amateur sculptor, his disturbing black dog has crouched outside the National Gallery of Australia since 2004, and he won the $100 000 McClelland Sculpture Prize in late 2007. Amor has painted scientist Peter Doherty and governor-general Peter Cosgrove on commission for the National Portrait Gallery, which mounted the exhibition Rick Amor: 21 Portraits in 2014â€“2015.",

After returning home she taught ceramics, drawing and printmaking in Launceston, and made a number of self portraits in etching and woodcut. Moving to Melbourne, she taught at the National Gallery of Victoria School and in her practice â€“ inspired by Andy Warhol and others â€“ she became increasingly interested in photographic processes such as photo-screenprinting and photo-etching. From 1979 to 1980 she made a large wax-coated collage of embossed hand-made paper words on commission for the new High Court in Canberra. Following the loss of her home and studio in the Ash Wednesday fires in early 1983, she went back to Tasmania. In all, between 1964 and 2006, Maddock held more than 40 solo exhibitions and her work was included in over 70 Australian and international group shows. From 1993 to 1998 she worked on _Terra Spiritus: With a Darker Shade of Pale_, a monumental 52-sheet panorama of the entire coastline of Tasmania made from ochre pigment she sourced and ground herself, and featuring placenames in local First Nations languages in refutation of the colonial notion of _terra nullius_ â€“ uninhabited land.",

After studying in Paris, first at the AcadÃ©mie Montmarte under Fernand LÃ©ger and later at La Grande ChaumiÃ¨re, he developed a hyper-real style with suggestions of surrealism. Over many decades, his paintings explored images of people dwarfed by the strong, simple shapes of man-made structures in urban environments. He painted several self-portraits; this drawing relates to a small one included in Philip Baconâ€™s highly successful 2001 exhibition of the artistâ€™s paintings. From 1963, Smart lived in Arezzo, Tuscany. In 1996, he published Not Quite Straight - A Memoir, a vivid series of snapshots of his transformation from Adelaide art teacher to successful artist and Tuscan signore. Remaining lucid, he kept painting almost until the end of his life.",

After becoming associated with the modernist art patrons John and Sunday Reed, he made the complex series of paintings of Ned Kelly for which he is best known at their home Heide between 1945 and 1947. From 1950 Nolan lived abroad, but returned to Australia at regular intervals and continued to explore Australian themes and landscapes. A major retrospective of his work, _Sidney Nolan â€“ A New Retrospective_, held at the Art Gallery of NSW in 2007, brought together more than 100 of his works. \\n\\nNolan painted a number of self portraits, beginning early in his career. The merged inky blues, pinks and subtle greys of this example are characteristic of the artist's late style. While there is a trace of a satisfied smile, the face is elusive, hazy, veiled, with the head apparently oscillating between profile and three-quarter view. Ultimately, the painting is ambiguous, seeming, like all Nolan's self portraits, to allude simultaneously to his public persona and his internal imagination â€“ to both the mask, and the inner poetry of the artist.",

If you grew another arm, you know, you hope it would look like a painting, or anyway, put it this way: a painting sometimes feels like an extension of yourself.\\n\\nAnd I believe, in the past, that Chinese artists working some of their bamboo paintings, would put their fingers right into the brush, into bristles of the brush, and work there in order to feel this kind of electric thing flowing through them; that they want to get as close as possible to the ink. I think itâ€™s something to do with growth, that this is one of the things thatâ€™s at you.\\n\\nAnd â€¦ the other obsession, or compulsion in a way, is that the growth shall be something that other people can recognise, that itâ€™s got a meaning for them. And I think this is the kind of rather knife-edge thing that painters are on; that they want to produce something out of themselves but they want it to be something that other people will recognise. I mean, itâ€™s almost as if, I suppose â€“ although one hesitates to use the image â€“ but if you produced a child and nobody liked it or recognised it or anything else. You not only produce it, but you want it to be part of the common experience and to be recognised as such.\\n\\nAnd I think in Australia now â€¦ is probably this rather wonderful position where all this is coming together. You donâ€™t produce things out of your own compulsions to find that they fall on stony ground. Itâ€™s now beginning that youâ€™re getting a response, and this of course enables you to produce more and more and make it richer and richer.\\n\\nAnd it seems to me that young painters now, here in Australia, are just at the moment when they can kind of have full confidence that whatever they produce honestly will meet with the recognition, and from this moment on you get back to what you got in Italy and Spain and all these things; you get the community and the art matching each other.",

Oil on composition board measuring 121 centimetres in height and 91 centimetres in length.\\n\\nThe frame is a warm gold with soft pink textured strokes worked in. The portrait focuses on Nolanâ€™s head and upper torso and the use of colour with blue tones, blushing pinks and subtle greys unifies the background and figure. Large brush marks create texture in the otherwise flat blue and grey toned background. This contrasts with the figure where the artist has applied the paint with his fingers, and the white surface of the board is revealed in sections.\\n\\nNolan is unclothed, painted in an abstract style with colours alternating between fleshy pink tones and a bruisy blue. His head is a bulbous oval, the back of the head carries the shape of his mid-length wispy hair and is rendered in smudged finger marks. His face is ambiguous, with a sense of being both in profile and in three-quarter view. A set of round glasses perch on the bridge of his nose which is in profile. Playing around with perspective, the glasses are shown in three-quarter view as if he was turning towards us. His left eye is blurred, disguised by the frames. His lips are in profile view, stained a deep blue and heavily smudged with finger marks dragged through the paint. \\n\\nTrailing from his neck in the profile view is a wobbly striped blue and orange tie. His body is cropped at the chest and shoulders by the frame.\\n\\nThe artist signature, â€˜nolanâ€™ above the numbers â€˜88â€™, are painted in small orange letters in the bottom right-hand corner. \\n\\nAudio description written by Alana Sivell and voiced by Molly Desmond",

In the late 1940s he trained at the National Art School; he travelled and studied overseas through the first half of the 1950s. In 1967 he won first prize at the Mildura Sculpture Triennial with a large cast-iron equestrian piece. His subsequent public commissions include the untitled copper and ceramic mosaic fountain at Bruce Hall at the Australian National University; _Spheres_ 1977 (known locally as _Bertâ€™s Balls_) for the Rundle Street Mall, Adelaide; and the _Dobell Memorial_ 1978 for Martin Place, Sydney. Controversially, _Tumbling cubes (Dice) (Untitled)_ 1978/1979, originally made for Cameron Offices in Belconnen ACT, was some years ago moved to a nearby park, according to the artist a 'hopelessly inappropriate site'. _Cones_ 1982 dominates the Sculpture Garden at the National Gallery of Australia, and the _Winged figure (Lawrence Hargrave memorial)_ 1988 towers 6m high at Mt Keira, near Wollongong. Flugelman taught from 1973 to 1983 at the South Australian School of Art, and from 1984 to 1990 at the University of Wollongong, from which he received an honorary doctorate. There was a retrospective exhibition of his five decades' work at the Drill Hall Gallery, Australian National University in 2009.",

Strongly interested in modern art, she attended the avant-garde Westminster School, where she completed what are considered some of Australia's first cubist paintings, _Still Life_ and _Painting IX_ (both 1937). With the outbreak of war she returned to Australia, thereafter teaching at Canberra Grammar and then at the Julian Ashton and National Art Schools in Sydney. The first of her thirteen solo exhibitions was held at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries in 1940; over decades, she was close friends with fellow Macquarie artists Grace Cossington Smith and Thea Proctor. She painted many still-life pictures, featuring flowers and fruit arranged on sunlit indoor tables, but from the 1950s onward she also painted abstract works, often inspired by landscapes and influenced by Paul CÃ©zanne. Though her work is now represented in major collections, Appleton was like many women artists of her generation in that recognition came late in life: she was in her eighties when a public gallery first presented a retrospective exhibition of her art.\\n\\nThis is a study for the self portrait with which Appleton won the inaugural Portia Geach Memorial Award in 1965. Her abstract landscapes are evoked in the background to the finished self-portrait, which is more sombre than this sketchy, light-filled, rosy study.",

I like to work very freely and spontaneously in colour. And I feel if one has too much of a preconceived idea, one tends to lose the freshness and get a rather forced and striving feeling about it, as if you were trying to copy something that you already had seen in your mind.\\n\\nIâ€™ve found myself becoming increasingly interested in still life subjects. I feel I like to abstract them a good deal but Iâ€™m interested in shapes and objects in space, and their relationship to each other, and I look for the abstract qualities in these things rather than making any effort to reproduce them.\\n\\nIâ€™m interested in order; I donâ€™t like things to be chaotic, and I like to feel that there is an ordered relation between the parts of a painting. Colour, of course, is an absolute joy, and I love warm colours; reds, yellows and warm violets, although I get a great deal of pleasure out of blues, too â€“ I think itâ€™s perhaps unwise to say that you have any favourite colours.\\n\\nI like to work on a fairly large scale and I like to be able to start a painting and go on and work and work at it without being interrupted. I think thatâ€™s one of the most difficult things in this modern life we lead, being able to get away from interruptions.\\n\\nBut I do think itâ€™s awfully difficult to say just what your aim is in painting a picture. I feel that the picture says it for you much better than you can say it yourself. And I feel that any good thing in a painting is usually something that you canâ€™t talk about.",

Moving to the Northern Territory in the late 1940s, he worked as a drover and miner, before relocating to Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia. He converted to Baptist Christianity in the mid-1960s, and became a church elder. Shortly after this he began to make shields, boomerangs and coolamons decorated with ochre; he started to paint figuratively on paper, shields and canvas in the early 1980s. Many of his paintings include Christian imagery, and some combine his traditional stories and personal experiences with Baptist stories; his body of work expresses his philosophy that we 'gotta make 'em whole lot one family'. The exhibition _Jarinyanu David Downs, Kurtal as Sel_f, held in the artist's community of Fitzroy Crossing in 2016, was the first show of his works since his death in 1995.\\n\\nThis 1990 self-portrait was among the works in the 2016 exhibition. Karen Dayman's essay in the exhibition catalogue states that in this painting, Jarinyanu has depicted himself painted for a ceremony honouring Kurtal the Rainmaker and celebrating the connection between the rain and the replenishment of the land and of food sources that it creates.",

He used natural earth pigments and synthetic polymer paint on an unframed linen canvas approximately 1.1 m tall and 84 cm wide.\\n\\nThe deep orange-ochre ground the work is painted on shows as a border around the edges of the canvas. Within it, a narrow rectangle, about 2 cm wide, has been painted freehand in black. Along the top edge and part way down the right side are short black lines poking inwards, each ending in a round black mass. They start small in the top left and grow larger.\\n\\nWithin the borders, the background of orange-ochre is covered in small yellow and grey dots.\\n\\nJarinyanu stands in the centre, a simplified black figure with round eyes and a wide mouth. He is decorated with grey and white markings, a band around his forehead, curved mirrored chest markings, a groin covering and stripes upon each upper thigh.\\n\\nHe is positioned straight on, arms raised to a long black beam running horizontally under his chin. It spans almost the entire width of the canvas. The beam is surrounded by finer vertical grey lines tipped with grey dots.\\n\\nFilling the bottom of the portrait around Jarinyanuâ€™s feet is a semi-circle of rows of numerous small black seated figures with round heads and outstretched arms.\\n\\nAudio description written and voiced by Lucinda Shawcross",

Having achieved great success in this field â€“ he won a Cannes Gold Lion in 1967 â€“ he gave it up to paint full-time in 1980, working from a 'cabin' below his home on Sydney Harbour. Soon, his stylised, colourful representations of Sydney's beaches, harbour, animals and flowers found their way onto placemats, t-shirts, swimwear, bedlinen, mugs and vases; in the 1990s, the walls, ceiling and some furniture in the Garden Restaurant at the Powerhouse Museum were covered with murals by the artist. His crucial role in promoting Sydney as a tourist destination, particularly in Japan, is now widely acknowledged. Until this self portrait was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery, no major Australian art museum held an example of his work. His memoir _Ken Done: A life coloured in_ was published in 2016 and his _Ken Done: Paintings you probably haven't seen_ in 2017.",

Oil and synthetic polymer paint on canvas measures 102 centimetres high and 76 centimetres wide.\\n\\nThe frame is painted a matte black with a floral and leaf design loosely scratched into the surface. The inner border of the frame is a darkened gold.\\n\\nThe background and figure are a patchwork of clashing colours and patterns. The surface is heavily textured, with brush marks evident and some short hairs from the paint brush caught in the paint. Ken Doneâ€™s face fills the frame; the top of his head, edges of his ears and base of neck, reach the outer edges of the canvas.\\n\\nA line of thick black paint arcs across the top of his head. His face is divided into shapes, with his forehead painted red with yellow dots on the left side and cobalt blue on the right side, with a stylised white outline of the Sydney Harbour Bridge floating on top. The rest of his face is painted in zones of pink, forest green and blues. A patch of black with yellow stripes features under the left eye. A simplified outline of the Sydney Opera House is painted in white, filled in with blue on the right cheek.\\n\\nHe has painted himself with three non-matching eyes; the left eye, pink and blue with a yellow pupil, the right eye, yellow with a black pupil and a central eye, blue with a yellow pupil outlined in yellow. He has merged a profile face with a full-face representation, reminiscent of a cubist style of painting. Thick yellow paint outlines the yellow eye, eyebrow and side profile of a nose and mouth with a flash of white teeth. This profile sits on top of the right side of the full-face view. The frontal representation is more dominant with the eyes rimmed in black, a black moustache and exaggerated red banana-shaped smile. His neck brings together strong brush strokes of purple, orange, red, black and blue. \\n\\nThe top half of the background is painted a cobalt blue with the word â€˜meâ€™ painted in yellow block letters in the top left corner. The lower section of the canvas is coloured orange on the left side of his neck and has sections of mottled tones of turquoise, burgundy and green and a patch of yellow with irregular red dots on the right.  \\nThe artist initials, â€˜KDâ€™ are roughly painted in red in the lower right-hand corner. \\n\\nAudio description written by Alana Sivell and voiced by Molly Desmond.",

He responded to the expressionist legacy of the city and the hardship and rude vigour of the times, and his lifetimeâ€™s work evidences affinities with Austrian expressionists such as Oskar Kokoshka whom he met in his youth. With his wife Rosa, Foxhill migrated to Australia in 1956. Two years later, the couple moved into the raw, newly established suburb of Dickson, now an inner-city area of Canberra. Foxhillâ€™s strength of purpose and belief in himself carried him through years of cultural aridity in the Australian Capital Territory, in which he was one of very few serious expressionist painters. Finally, in the 1980s, the power of his portraits describing emotional and psychological states recognition began to be recognised. The National Portrait Gallery held an exhibition of Foxhillâ€™s work, curated by Michael Desmond, in the last year of the artistâ€™s life. Foxhill said â€˜A painter paints not because he wants to represent what he sees and is competent to do so, but because the visible world stimulates him to satisfy his deep urge to shape his understanding of life and nature.â€™",

Having narrowly escaped Auschwitz as a girl, Mora trained in drama in Paris. By 1951, when she came to Melbourne with her husband, Georges, she was committed to painting. Soon the couple became friends with the city's leading artists and collectors, and were instrumental in the re-formation of the Contemporary Art Society. Over the 1950s and 1960s they opened the European-style Mirka CafÃ© in Exhibition Street, Balzac in East Melbourne and the Tolarno in St Kilda. While Georges established himself as an art dealer, opening Tolarno Galleries in 1967, Mirka became a bohemian icon of the city. She worked prolifically for six decades across a range of media and is represented in many state and regional collections.\\n\\nPainted in 2000, when she was in her early seventies, this self-portrait depicts Mora with the youthful looks for which she was known so well. Despite this, there is a sense of age and quiet to the portrait; the palette of subdued earth tones, and the treatment of the eyes particularly, give the sense that Mora approached this work from a point of introspection. Created in the year she left her beloved little cottage in St Kilda and moved into a new flat her son William built for her at his gallery in Richmond, this work may acknowledge unsurprising feelings of sadness, time passing and the end of an era.",

Actually my drawings are like living dreams. Sometimes they appear very incoherent but I know that all this incoherence, if I search in it the truth is there. Each drawing has a very strong meaning. It as if my unconscious â€“ or subconscious â€“ would want to become conscious. Each drawing is a riddle which I have to decipher, and this is why I can never, I will never stop drawing because the answers of the riddles always come, sooner or later.\\n\\nWhen I was expecting my third child I was drawing my little people all the time. Sometimes Iâ€™d draw little animals too, but they have human legs or they have human arms. This goes back far away in the history of art, of course, Iâ€™m aware of that, but itâ€™s a truth and it travels all through time and it comes and visits some artists from time to time. Must be that little beast weâ€™ve got inside us, thatâ€™s what it is. Anyhow, when I was expecting my third child, all my little drawings had four toes, and everybody used to say, â€˜Why do you do four toes? You know a foot has five toesâ€™, and I said, â€˜Well, my people have four toes, you know, I canâ€™t help it, my hand does it. Iâ€™m not thinking about it. It just has to have four toes because when I feel the foot it just comes out with four toesâ€™. And when my baby came out, he was born, it had one foot with four toes.\\n\\nSo you can see what faith I have in my work. The truth is inside you always and you have to find it.",

Born in Vienna, Cassab studied art in Prague and at the Budapest Academy before adopting false papers and 'going underground' to escape the persecution of Hungarian Jews. After the war, she and her husband reunited and emigrated to Sydney in 1951. Within months of arriving, she was commissioned by Sir Charles Lloyd Jones to paint a portrait of his wife, becoming an Archibald finalist for the first time the following year. By the mid-1960s she was sought-after as a portraitist. She won the Archibald Prize twice, for her portrait of her friend, Stanislaus Rapotec, in 1960, and with her painting of artist Margo Lewers in 1967. Through her many other portraits she created a distinct record of Australian society from the 1950s onwards. Cassab also found inspiration for a more abstract style of painting in the landscape of the Northern Territory, to which she repeatedly returned, and won several awards for her landscape works in the Wynne Prize. \\n\\nCassab painted this self-portrait at the age of 86 in 2006. It captures her spirit of resilience and determination, having survived the Holocaust and built a successful career as a portrait artist in Australia.",

Then, as I developed in my other paintings, the portrait developed with it. I still think that every portrait I do is a failure because it didnâ€™t reach what I wanted to do with it. I think Iâ€™m best known as a portrait painter because these are the things that get most publicity, but I never wanted to be a portrait painter and I donâ€™t consider myself one.\\n\\nLately, I tried to combine abstract with the portrait but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good marriage. I think the best I can do is to paint my abstract pictures and develop them and develop myself, and let the portraits flow freely, because I donâ€™t believe that something which was art all through the centuries stops being art just because it lost its credit by the photographic portraits, the anonymous portraits, from which we have 300 in each country in the world; and although I know that it is a clash, I think, between my other paintings and the portraits, I canâ€™t give up. Itâ€™s something that interests me, and that I might solve or might not. Anyway, it doesnâ€™t matter if I solve it when Iâ€™m 70.",

Although he is known for his landscapes and mythical subjects, and produced relatively few portraits, Boyd made a number of paintings of family and friends, all redolent of his interest in deep human truths. This intense and searching self-portrait was painted at a time when the artist was reading the novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, and engaged on a series of works on the agony of war. Although he represented himself as apprehensive and isolated, Albert Tucker took a photo of Boyd with the recently completed work, surrounded by friends in his studio at his familyâ€™s home, which captures the sense of the shared creative environment in which this and other portraits of the 1940s were painted.",

But, I mean, you donâ€™t ever come out with anything fresh or marvellous, it always seems ghastly when it goes up on the wall, and maybe it is.\\n\\nI hope itâ€™s becoming less taped, or typed. Not meant to be a pun, but anyway, I think thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d prefer to be happening, that itâ€™s becoming just as much mine, if I can make it that way, but much less typed in the sense that it would be, well, â€˜thatâ€™s Australianâ€™, or â€˜that comes from Melbourne, that comes from Ballarat, thatâ€™s where â€¦â€™. Iâ€™d like it to be much more a universal sort of thing. I donâ€™t mean necessarily the painting to look as if it could be done anywhere, but just that it would be much more like good painting rather than like something that comes from somewhere.",

Dora married Leslie Nichol Walford, the youngest son of colonial Sydney businessman, William Barnard Walford, in 1917. Their only child, Leslie Nichol Walford junior, who was to achieve renown as an interior decorator, was born in 1927. Following her husbandâ€™s death in 1929, Dora became increasingly involved in charity and fundraising work. In 1936, as Dora Sheller (and a widow for the second time), she helped establish the Black & White Committee of the Royal Blind Society of NSW, and served as the Committeeâ€™s first president. In 1938, Dora left Sydney for England accompanied by Leslie and her third husband, Ben Knowles-Davies (who died in the course of the journey). In England during the war, Dora worked as a salvage officer for Winchester County Council. She married again in 1944; her fourth husband, Lawrence Byrne, was then serving with the British army. They remained in London until 1951, when they returned to Australia and settled at Burradoo in the Southern Highlands. Dora Byrne died in Sydney in 1972.\\n\\nRichard von Marientreu (1902â€“1991) was born in Poland and attended military academies in Cracow and Vienna before leaving for Prague, where he studied at the Academy of Painting. In London from 1933, von Marientreu was introduced into fashionable society by his patron, Mrs Marie Ludlow- Symonds. He was soon in demand as a portrait painter, many of his subjects coming from high-ranking sections of the military and society, including royalty. Between 1935 and 1955, he created portraits of sitters such as King George V; Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother; and Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery. He also exhibited regularly throughout this period, often with large scale genre paintings dealing with subjects such as mythology, war and historical scenes. His obituary in The Times recalled him as â€˜a very gentle man, and immaculately turned out, choosing always to paint, no matter what the subject, in one of the same Savile Row tailored suits that he might wear to one of his exhibition openingsâ€™.",

Having been presented at court in London, in 1911 she married St Kilda-born Norman Brookes, the first Australian and the first left-hander to win Wimbledon, whose position with the Red Cross took them to Egypt in World War 1. There, she organised nursesâ€™ canteens, rest homes and concert parties. Back in Melbourne, where the couple lived for the rest of their lives, she wrote a few novels and became involved with the Childrenâ€™s Hospital Committee. In 1923 she began her 46-year term as president of the Queen Victoria Hospital for Women and in 1926 she took on her 25-year presidency of the Animal Welfare League. She was also president of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and involved with the Anglican Babiesâ€™ Home. During World War 2 she was active in the establishment of rest and recreation facilities for service personnel. Having seen her two daughters married in glittering style (40 000 spectators are said to have seen her first daughter, Cynthia, emerge from her marriage to Melbourneâ€™s first bachelor Lord Mayor, Harold Gengoult Smith) she began writing history books. She had a substantial collection of Napoleonana; she purchased the land on which he had been incarcerated for the French government, and as a consequence was made a Chevalier of the LÃ©gion dâ€™Honneur in 1960. When she died, Sir Robert Menzies paid tribute to her â€˜beautiful organising mindâ€™.",

An enigmatic self-made man, Potter worked full- time while studying economics full-time at Sydney University; he graduated top of his year. In 1936 he moved to Melbourne to found the stockbroking firm Ian Potter & Co. Over his career he served on the boards of twenty-five companies, travelling often to the US and Europe. He retired from Potter and Co in 1967, three years after creating the Ian Potter Foundation. During his lifetime alone, its grants amounted to more than $22 million, and he himself made large donations to the arts, hospitals, universities, sciences, social welfare and environment and heritage conservation until he died. Knighted in 1962, Potter was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Science in 1978 for his â€˜conspicuous service to the cause of scienceâ€™.\\n\\n\\n\\nBryan Westwood (1930â€“2000), painter and printmaker, was largely self-taught, although he took some classes with Justin Oâ€™Brien, Jeffrey Smart and Dorothy Thornhill in the 1960s. Westwood first exhibited paintings of streets and buildings of a vaguely surrealist nature at the Bonython Galleries in 1969. He later turned to photorealist portraits, many of them depicting his artist friends. One such, of artist and critic Elwyn Lynn, won him the Archibald Prize of 1989; he won the prize again in 1992 with an unnerving portrayal of Prime Minister Paul Keating. Between 1972 and 1992 he held solo exhibitions annually. The National Portrait Gallery has portraits by Westwood of Vincent, Warwick and James Fairfax, Bart Cummings, Justin Oâ€™Brien, Sir Ian McLennan, Tim Storrier and Malcolm Fraser. This painting, considered by Lady Potter to be the most convincing portrayal of her late husband, was part of the seminal exhibition Uncommon Australians: Towards an Australian Portrait Gallery in 1992â€“93.",

By 1975, she was its regional director in South Australia. She was Foundation Chair of the National Aboriginal Conference in 1977 and chaired the Aboriginal Development Commission from 1989 to 1990. O'Donoghue was Australian of the Year in 1984, when she became the first Aboriginal person to address the General Assembly of the United Nations.

Currently she is Patron of Reconciliation South Australia and of the Lowitja Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health.\\n\\nRobert Hannaford said of O'Donoghue that he observed a 'vast understanding and sympathy in her face, a sadness', but also thought she looked 'fantastic in that light I've got in that studio'.

But I quickly got to know him and respect him, and I knew that by the questioning and so on that he was really trying to find out more about me. So, Iâ€™m not sure that he knew much about [the] Stolen Generation. After I saw the portrait come out, I myself felt the portrait wasnâ€™t like me because Robert had told me very early in the piece that I wasnâ€™t to smile. He doesnâ€™t like smiling portraits. People who know me of course know that I do smile a lot.\\n\\nThe suit that I wore on the day, I think he was a bit surprised because it was really quite formal and itâ€™s a suit that I wear when I receive the many awards that Iâ€™ve received over the years. My family had no difficulty at all seeing me turn up in that same suit. And because it was a portrait, I thought, well, you know, Iâ€™m an Aboriginal woman and Iâ€™m going to wear the Aboriginal flag, and Iâ€™m going to wear everything red, black and yellow.\\n\\nIâ€™m much more proud of the fact that Iâ€™m a nurse and that I was able to use my nursing experience to actually travel to remote areas in my own, well in my own right, just doing what I could to heal people. I didnâ€™t know my people very well and so on, this is one way of getting to know them out on the APY lands. I have had a lot of senior jobs, met just so many people in high places, really. And I enjoyed seeing them but they werenâ€™t the most important things in my life. It was really about making a difference.",

The work measures about 1.4 m tall by 1.4 m wide, set in its wide frame of dark wood. The portrait is painted realistically with loosely applied brushstrokes. Lowitja wears a bright red skirt-suit and is seated in front of a dark background.\\n\\nThe scene is lit from the top left. Lowitja is illuminated in a soft pool of light filling the top right and centre of the painting. Pale green-grey and blue-grey brush strokes at the top right curve around and down towards the bottom left, their direction changing, sweeping around and getting darker towards the lower edge of the canvas.\\n\\nLowitja sits on a dark wood chair in the centre of the image. The rounded corners of its back rise above each of her shoulders. Her head is tilted slightly down to her left with her chin angled up. Lowitjaâ€™s silvery hair is short, parted on the side, and styled in a wave over her forehead. Her skin is in warm honey tones and her cheeks are tinged pink. Lowitja has fine steeply-arched eyebrows above her dark eyes that gaze directly at us. Her nose is broad and deep grooves flow from it to the outer edges of her thin rosy lips. Her lips are closed and slightly downturned, creating soft jowels which frame her broad chin.\\n\\nIn the portrait Lowitja wears a loosley-fitted long jacket that runs down her lap to her knees. It has an Aboriginal Flag pin on the left lapel and is open, with three large round gold buttons gleaming brightly down its left side. A strand of black red and yellow beads and an oval shaped Aboriginal Flag pendant on a fine chain stand out against her black round-necked top.\\n\\nLowitjaâ€™s elbows rest lightly on the carved wooden arms of the chair and her hands lie with fingers extended in her lap. On the ring finger of her left hand she wears a wide yellow-gold band, while on her right a ring is set with a large black rectangular stone.\\n\\nLowitjaâ€™s red skirt extends over her knees and out of frame. The same red has been used by the artist to sign â€˜Hannaford 06â€™ on the bottom right of the canvas.\\n\\nAudio description written by Lucinda Shawcross and voiced by Amy Middleby",

By the time of the birth of their sons, William junior and John (1804â€“1877), Fairfax senior was involved in the furniture trade. Widowed in 1835, she emigrated to New South Wales with John, his wife Sarah (nÃ©e Reading, 1808â€“1875), and their three children in 1838. Three years later, John Fairfax, in partnership with journalist Charles Kemp, purchased the Sydney Herald, which became the Sydney Morning Herald in 1842. By the mid-1850s, John Fairfax, with his sons Charles John Fairfax (1829â€“1864) and James Reading Fairfax (1834 â€“1919), owned the Herald outright, building a highly successful publishing enterprise and a family association with the paper that would last almost 150 years. Elizabeth was remembered by her grandson James as â€˜a woman of strong religious convictionsâ€™ who greatly influenced her sonâ€™s contributions to the Congregational Church in the colony. â€˜It was her teaching and inheriting her strong character that led to [John Fairfaxâ€™s] success in life and in placing her sons and grandsons where they areâ€™, he said. Elizabeth died in Sydney, aged 83, in 1861.",

One of the first undergraduates to study at the University of Sydney, he developed a particular interest in education and the rights of women â€“ he was responsible for the Married Women's Property Act of 1879, and was Founding Chairman of the universityâ€™s Womenâ€™s College. As a young man he worked as a reporter on Henry Parkesâ€™s radical liberal newspaper Empire. Windeyer represented West Sydney in the Legislative Assembly intermittently from 1860; in 1876 and 1878â€“1879 he was attorney general in the Parkesâ€“Robertson coalition. This portrait is one of a trio that Tom Roberts dubbed â€˜Church, State and the Lawâ€™ â€“ the others were a portrait of Parkes, and one of Cardinal Moran. Parkes wrote in Fifty Years in the Making of Australian History (1892) that â€˜My friend Windeyer was a young man of high spirit, bold and decisive in the common incidents of life, with a strong capacity for public affairs. He would have made as good a soldier as he has made a sound Judge.â€™",

All that he may hope for is, after years of toil laboriously spent in trying to do his duty, that he may win the confidence of the intelligent thinking portion of the community, those who are interested in maintaining law and order, those who desire to see the rights of property respected, and every citizen protected, as far as the right administration of justice can protect him, in the enjoyment of his personal liberty, in his character and in the exercise of his rights. And when the public has thoroughly come to understand that his only desire is to see the right succeed and the truth established, juries may feel confident that they may safely accept such advice and assistance in their deliberations as it comes within the province of a judge to offer. Of popularity beyond this he can know nothing\\n\\nThe duties he has to discharge are often disagreeable, and sometimes painful. Indeed, one of the drawbacks attending the judicial position was that it very much cut one off from social intercourse with oneâ€™s fellow citizens in a small society like this, where everyone was known, and where so many who might be known as acquaintances, were frequently before the Court, as parties to proceedings before it. So, one must be careful to avoid all appearance of evil occasion for scandal.",

Aged sixteen, she was cast in the lead role of the film _Jedda_, but the experience was largely negative, and at twenty she joined the Community of the Holy Name, an Anglican order of nuns in Melbourne. With the order's blessing, she left in 1967 to undertake community work with Aboriginal people. She was involved in various initiatives with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs before returning to the Northern Territory where she was active in politics, social work and environmental causes. In 1979, she sought election to the Legislative Assembly to fight the proposed construction of a dam which threatened sacred land. Having moved back to Utopia in 2008, she became a prominent spokesperson for First Nations peoples and human rights, addressing the UN's Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 2010 and speaking out on issues including the Northern Territory Intervention and Aboriginal deaths in custody. She was the Northern Territory Australian of the Year and the NAIDOC Person of the Year for 2015.\\n\\nThis portrait by Melbourne-born painter and engraver Donald Cameron shows Kunoth around the time she took her final vows in 1964.",

In 1935 Drysdale married Elizabeth 'Bon' Stephens and two years later, Purves Smith left for Europe, followed in 1938 by Maisie and her mother. After Maisie returned home Purves Smith cabled his proposal to her but they were separated for the duration of the war. They married in 1946 in Melbourne, with Drysdale as best man; however, Purves Smith died following surgery to relieve symptoms of tuberculosis in 1949. Three years later, Maisie completed library studies and became a librarian at the City of Coburg Library and later, the Camberwell City Library. She also served on the Editorial Committee of the Children's Book Council of Victoria. In November 1963, Bon Drysdale died, and seven months later Maisie married Russell Drysdale. They bought a block of land near Gosford, Bouddi Farm, where they lived for the rest of their lives, travelling widely; Maisie outlived Russell by twenty years.\\n\\nThis modernist portrait of Maisie by her husband-to-be Peter Purves Smith is thought to have been painted while they were both in London, before he joined the British Army in 1940. The restricted colour palette focuses attention on Maisie's elegant profile, framed by her fur collar.",

During the 1940s Pockley had three children and spent a significant period in England, to which she always adhered and returned. From the 1950s through to the 1990s, she pursued and promulgated her interests in gardening, embroidery, music, art and books. In 1957 she co-founded the NSW Embroiderer's Guild, of which she was later patron. In 1964 she founded the National Trust of Australia NSW Garden Committee to design, maintain and raise funds for National Trust gardens. She also worked with the National Trust Women's Committee for the restoration of Elizabeth Farm, Old Government House and Lindesay. The library she built up at home was disbursed, but reassembled in 1998 and presented by Caroline Simpson to the State Library of NSW as the Diana Pockley Horticultural Library.

After fighting in the _Bellerophon_ at Trafalgar, in 1818 he made his first Arctic voyage, a fruitless expedition to locate the Northwest Passage, a sea route linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. From 1824 to 1828 he commanded another expedition to the Arctic which resulted in a knighthood. After 30 years of naval service, he accepted an appointment as lieutenant-governor of Tasmania, arriving in Hobart in 1837. Franklin, his wife Jane and his private secretary Alexander Maconochie brought progressive ideas about the cultural development of the colony and the reformation of the penal system, but powerful colonists, who profited from convict labour, harried him until he was recalled in 1843. Franklin disappeared on his final expedition to the Arctic in 1845. Jane Franklin sponsored four expeditions to find him before it was eventually established that he and all of his crew had perished.",

During World War I, Kingsford Smith had served on the ground in Gallipoli, Egypt and France before transferring to the Australian Flying Corps and later the Royal Flying Corps, as a member of which he was awarded the Military Cross. He worked in England, America and Australia as a stunt flyer and joy- flight pilot before forming his own aviation company in 1924. Charles Ulm, who at the age of sixteen had been amongst the first troops to land at Gallipoli, and who had later served on the Western Front, had returned to Sydney with a vision of establishing successful commercial airlines. He became Kingsford Smithâ€™s business partner in 1927. That year they circumnavigated Australia in less than half the previous record time. In 1928, he and Kingsford Smith co-piloted the plane later known as Southern Cross across the Pacific from California to Brisbane. Later that year the pair made the first trans-Tasman flight from Sydney to Christchurch. Ulm made several more record-breaking flights, both with Kingsford Smith in Southern Cross, and in command of his own aircraft Faith in Australia. In 1934, Ulm went down in the sea between California and Hawaii in his Airspeed Envoy Stella Australis. His body was never found. Kingsford Smith had become world-famous by 1930, and in 1932 he was knighted for services to aviation, but in business he was almost back to where he started, selling joyflights at ten shillings a ride and establishing an ill-fated flying school. Nonetheless, his marvellous achievements continued until he, too, disappeared, probably near the coast of Burma, on an attempt at the Britain-Australia record.\\n\\nOne of seventeen portraits by Sir William Dargie acquired by 2013, the painting of the aviation heroes is also one of a mere handful of posthumous portraits in the Collection. In 2001 the Sydney Airports Corporation made a gift of the painting to the National Portrait Gallery along with two busts of Kingsford Smith and Ulm by Enid Fleming.",

                    "transcript": "The double portrait of Captain Charles Kingsford Smith and Captain Charles Ulm was painted by William Dargie in 1961 and measures 133.5 cm high by 108.8 cm wide.\\n\\nThe pair are presented against a brilliant blue sky with patches of white wispy cloud. Broad brushstrokes of light blue and pink give way to a greener bluish tint in the lower section of the background. The clouds descend into pale grey as the landscape blurs into the distance.\\n\\nBathed in sunlight, the men stand close together and are cropped at the hip. Captain Charles Ulm on our left, faces forward, half his body obscured by Sir Charles Kingsford Smith who stands in front, his body turned toward Ulm, side on.\\n\\nUlmâ€™s direct gaze is forward to us. He has wavy brown hair cut shorter around his prominent ears and a warm rosy tanned complexion. The light from his right creates shadows on the left side of his clear broad forehead and delineates his straight nose, plump cheeks and double chin. His arched dark eyebrows, narrowed laughing eyes and parted lips open his cheery face into a wide smile. \\n\\nUlm wears a beige and green scarf wrapped around his neck and tucked into his aviator jump suit, unzipped to form a V. The one-piece suit is uniformly steely blue grey, a large pocket with a silver button and open upper flap is visible on his right chest. The baggy suit puckers at his waist and upper arm, which is bent at the elbow, and allows his right hand to rest on his hip. Cropped at the bottom edge of the painting, a brown strap is visible looped around the top of his index finger. Although Ulm's left arm is unseen, wrapped behind the figure of Kingsford Smith, the fingers and the thumb of that hand rest on Kingsford Smith's left shoulder.\\n\\nSir Charles Kingsford Smith looks out to the right of the portrait with a similarly tanned complexion to Ulm. His brown leather aviator helmet sits tight on his skull over his ears and clips together under his chin. His round glass goggles are raised above his eyes and held tight against his forehead. With his long oval face in three-quarter profile, a shadow plays on the left side of his face, accentuating his straight eyebrows, drooped eyelids and blue eyes. He has pronounced cheek bones and a long slightly hooked nose. He too is smiling with closed lips, with a slight curved crease around both corners of his mouth. Kingsford Smith wears a chocolate brown leather flying jacket, one side flaps open across his chest and is lined in a beige green sheepskin. At his waist his hands clasp a long slim white folded paper.\\n\\n**Audio description written and voiced by Annette Twyman, 2021**",

He completed his initial training at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas in 1993 and undertook training for long-duration space missions in Russia. He made his first space flight in 1996 and in 1998 boarded the _Endeavour_ space shuttle to work at the Mir space station. As part of the 2001 _Discovery_ mission, he completed a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk to install components to the International Space Station. In 2005 he flew on the STS114 _Discovery_ mission, undertaking new methods to inspect the orbiter in flight and to verify its fitness for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. He retired from NASA in 2014 having logged more than 177 days in space.\\n\\nCommissioned to create this work, Canadian-born photographers Denis Montalbetti and Gay Campbell conceived of a heroic portrait evoking the sense of courage and discovery associated with images of the early days of space exploration. Photographing Thomas in his NASA spacesuit was central to the concept, but the suits are so valuable they are not allowed to leave NASA facilities. So the artists went to Houston for the shoot. They had the backdrop â€“ representing Earth as seen from space â€“ fabricated beforehand, so that they could create the image they'd planned.",

Born in the Northern Territory and raised in Brisbane, she was only fourteen when she won two silver medals at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. When she announced her retirement from international swimming in 2012, she had won a total of nine Olympic medals, fourteen World Championship medals and twelve Commonwealth Games medals. In her 2015 memoir _Body Lengths_, she candidly discussed her history of anxiety, depression and her experience of the bullying and humiliation often endured by female swimmers around issues of weight and body image. Consequently, Jones has been an ambassador for Beyond Blue and was one of the faces of Swimming Queensland's 'Growing up in Lycra' campaign. Jones was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2015.\\n\\nThis portrait of Jones is one of four images photographed by Peter Brew-Bevan for a feature story in _Good Weekend_ magazine. Published on 26 September 2015, this image featured on the cover. As Brew-Bevan noted on his Facebook page: 'It was an absolute pleasure creating this cover â€“ despite the commotion of Huskies chasing down little ducklings in the pool and it being a rather chilly 13 degrees! And no the pool was not heated!'",

At the age of 16 she became the first Aboriginal runner to win a Commonwealth gold medal. She won two more in 1994, and as the first Aboriginal track and field athlete to represent Australia at the Olympic Games, she won a silver medal in the 400m in Atlanta in 1996. She was ranked first in the world in her signature event, the 400m, in which she won back-to-back World Championships in 1997 and 1999 and the Olympic gold medal in 2000. She was the first person to be named both Young Australian of the Year (1990) and Australian of the Year (1998). Freeman retired from running in July 2003, still enjoying the immense popularity she earned during her exceptional career. The Catherine Freeman Foundation, established in 2007, has since enhanced opportunities for individuals living in disadvantaged Australian communities. \\n\\nDavid Caird, a press photographer, was assigned to cover Freeman's unforgettable Sydney Olympic race, which was at 8pm. Jammed between rival cameramen, he took this shot just before the start, as Freeman glanced skyward for a fraction of a second.",

After some years building midget racing cars, Brabham took to driving, winning the Australian midget-car title in 1951. Switching to road racing, he moved to England in the hope of becoming a Formula 1 driver. Racing in a Cooper Climax, Brabham won the World Championship in 1959 in sensational style. In the last lap of the deciding race he was leading the field when his fuel ran out. Undaunted, he pushed the vehicle over the finish line to take the Championship. It was his first of three. In 1966 he became the first driver in Formula 1 history to win the title in a car of his own design, the Repco Brabham. As a driver, Brabham has been described as â€˜untidy, but very effectiveâ€™. Indeed, he won a career total of 14 Grand Prix events before retiring in 1970. Australian of the Year in 1966, in 1979 he became the first person to be knighted for services to motor sport.\\n\\nSculptor Julie Edgar, a motor sports enthusiast, also made the bronze bust of Peter Brock in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery.

Before turning to road racing in 2001, heâ€™d represented Australia at the Atlanta and Sydney Olympics and won the mountain bike world cups of 1998 and 1999. A climber and time trial specialist known for his outstanding endurance and mental toughness, Evans finished inside the top ten in his first two Tour de France appearances. On his third, he became the first Australian to achieve a place on the podium, finishing second, and he was runner-up again in 2008. A week after finishing third in the 2009 Vuelta a EspaÃ±a he became the menâ€™s road racing world champion, following this up with wins in the Belgian road race La FlÃ¨che Wallone in 2010, and the Tirrenoâ€“Adriatico (in 2011). A favourite for the 2011 Tour de France, Evans secured the yellow jersey in the penultimate stage and on 24 July 2011 became the first Australian to win the epic race. He featured in its top ten again in 2012 and finished third in the gruelling 2013 edition of the Giro dâ€™Italia. A veteran of eight world championship road campaigns and member of the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Teams, Evans was Australian Male Road Cyclist of the Year six years running from 2006, and Australian Cyclist of the Year for 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2011. In late 2014, he unveiled plans for the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race, announcing on the same occasion that the inaugural instalment of the event in 2015 would be his last as a professional cyclist. \\n\\nMatthÃ¿s Gerber (b. 1956) was born in the Netherlands and has lived in Australia since 1972. Drawing on the modes of representation used throughout the history of European painting, he has produced a diverse body of work ranging from representational landscapes to abstraction.

Everyone told me you canâ€™t believe how fast it is and how many people there are and not only is it the most competitive with the deepest quality field, the most competitive field to race in, therefore the hardest to win at, it also goes far beyond the sport in terms of the public, the spectators, the number of spectators, but also the type of spectators. Youâ€™re still in a bike race and youâ€™re racing along roads but all of a sudden youâ€™re racing in a crowd of maybe a soccer stadium. And yeah, thatâ€™s sort of one race where youâ€™ll probably get beers spilt on you once while youâ€™re racing a bike. There might be 100, 200, 300 thousand people standing on the side of the road, and they all want to see one rider and if youâ€™re in the yellow jersey thatâ€™s really quite unlike anything else Iâ€™ve experienced in life. I wouldnâ€™t say itâ€™s healthy, three weeks is a long time to be in the limelight like that.\\n\\nObviously my 2011 Tour de France victory is what sort of shaped me as a bike rider and, I suppose, as an Australian sports person. Iâ€™m proud of how I got there and how I worked and the difficulties that I overcame to get there. Two years previously I became world champion on the road, I won the 2009 World Championship road cycling world championships and that was in a moment of difficulty. A lot of people in the world of cycling didnâ€™t believe in me. But I believed in myself, and I had a few key people around me believe in me and together we overcame what seemed like very difficult odds to do something that was at that moment in my sport in some ways historic.\\n\\nMy biggest thing that motivated me through my career was that one day, my opportunityâ€™s going to end and when that day comes I donâ€™t want to have any regrets that I didnâ€™tâ€™ work hard enough, that I didnâ€™t try hard enough, didnâ€™t make enough sacrifices or I wasnâ€™t dedicated enough. And when that day did come, I crossed the finish line of my last race and I left the world of competitive cycling at the top level in complete peace, with some pride and a great deal of satisfaction of what I had the opportunity to achieve and with those opportunities, what I achieved.",

He began his career in the 1993 film _The Heartbreak Kid_, alongside Claudia Karvan, and later starred in the spin-off television series _Heartbreak High_. In 1998, he took on a significantly grittier role as the protagonist of the film _Head On_, adapted from Christos Tsiolkas' novel _Loaded_. His performance was critically acclaimed and earned him an AFI Award nomination. He went on to appear in many films, plays and television shows including _The Slap_ (2011), for which he won the AACTA for Best Lead Actor in a television series. In 2016 he won the Logie for Most Outstanding Actor for _The Principal_ (2015). Recent television credits include _Tidelands_ (2018), _The Cry_ (2018) and _Amazing Grace_ (2021).\\n\\nAs an Australian-Greek man of a similar age, Michael Zavros had long been interested in painting Dimitriades. He painted this work for the 2005 Archibald Prize, employing a stark white background to focus attention on the actor's 'dark hooded eyes and intense stare.' 'He's a good-looking man', Zavros explained, 'but I wanted to avoid any kind of reference to the Greek Adonis ideal.'",

In 1976, Anderson joined the band Rose Tattoo, who gained a solid following on the pub circuit before releasing their first album in late 1978. Incorporating the hit single â€˜Bad Boy for Loveâ€™, Rose Tattoo remains one of the classic Australian rock albums. It reached number one on the UK heavy metal charts, as did its followup, Assault and Battery. The Tatts were a major influence on American heavy-metal band Guns Nâ€™ Roses, who insisted that the band re-form in 1993 to support them on their Sydney and Melbourne gigs; Angry and Guns Nâ€™ Roses frontman Slash appeared together again in Australia in 2010. Rose Tattoo disbanded in 1987; that year, Andersonâ€™s solo hit â€˜Suddenlyâ€™ was used as the backing track for Charleneâ€™s and Scottâ€™s wedding on Neighbours. Having already appeared in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985), Anderson took on further dramatic roles, notably that of Herod in the arena spectacular Jesus Christ Superstar (1992). Since the 1980s, he has been an outspoken social commentator, appearing regularly on A Current Affair, for example. The one-time face of Australian prostate cancer research, in the leadup to the Federal election in 2016 he sought a Senate seat, saying â€˜We have strict quarantine laws and it should be the same when it comes to cultures that do not want to integrate . . . If you come here, you should behave yourself â€“ itâ€™s as simple as that.â€™",

He had joined the expedition in Huahine in the Tahitian archipelago because he sought British arms to avenge the Bora Boran takeover of his fatherâ€™s land in Raâ€˜iatea. Cook had assented to his joining, reluctantly, because Mai promised insider knowledge and comraderie for the rest of the Pacific tour. Cook also knew that the naturalist Joseph Banks, back home, yearned to examine a Pacific Islander â€˜specimen.â€™ Banks assumed responsibility for Maiâ€™s stay as soon as the Islander disembarked in London. Banks introduced him to King George III and accompanied him on trips to various English towns. Banksâ€™s fascination dulled after some months, however, and he had set Mai up in a house of his own by early 1775. \\n\\nMai sat for many artists during his stay, including the Royal Academician Nathaniel Dance. In Danceâ€™s portrait, Mai carries a feather necklace and a wooden stool from home. He later gifted this stool to his voyager friend Tobias Furneaux, whose descendants in turn sold it in 1986 to the MusÃ©e de Tahiti. Dance depicted Mai in tapa cloths and with tattooed hand-markings similar to those shown in Joshua Reynoldsâ€™s portrait.",

After an appalling childhood in Ireland, France and Switzerland, he scraped through military school. He served four years in Palestine from 1874, and, having become fluent in Arabic, distinguished himself as an intelligence officer in the Sudan. Later, he trained up the Egyptian army to recapture Sudan from the Dervishes. Ruthlessly, he deployed British forces against the Boers in South Africa; those who persist in regarding â€˜Breakerâ€™ Morant as a hero still blame Kitchener for the execution of Morant and Peter Handcock in 1902. After some years commanding Indiaâ€™s army, he came to Australia to advise on the countryâ€™s defence forces. The â€˜Kitchener Reportâ€™, written during a rapid 1909â€“1910 tour, laid down the structure of the Australian military and also the nature of the military academy, which became Duntroon. As secretary of state for war (and the famously moustachioed â€˜faceâ€™ of World War 1) it was Kitchener, under pressure, who sent troops to the Dardanelles; thus, he committed the Anzacs, under the command of his protÃ©gÃ©, William Birdwood, to Gallipoli. Many agonising months later, Kitchener approved the evacuation. He died in June 1916 when the ship on which he was travelling hit a German mine; his body was never found.",

After the war he became the first president of the Citizen Military Forces Association (later the Army Reserve). Having formed Australiaâ€™s first unit trust before the war, in 1950 he formed Australiaâ€™s first merchant bank, Mainguard (Australia) Ltd. Over time he became the president of Austcare, the Refugee Council of Australia, the Australian Jewish Welfare Society for Refugees and the Royal Blind Society of New South Wales. In 1981 he received the Nansen Medal from the United Nations, in recognition of his work on behalf of refugees. \\n\\nMathew Lynn painted this forthright portrait of Cullen over a series of meetings at Cullenâ€™s grazing property in the Southern Highlands, and in his own studio in Sydney. On one occasion he rode out with Cullen to muster some cattle. The old soldier rounded them up, but asked Lynn to count them, as his sight was no longer what it was. Later he joked that Lynn is a better painter than horseman.",

Between 1953 and 1972 Rosewall won four Australian, two French and two US singles championship titles. Coached in Sydney by Harry Hopman, and sardonically nicknamed 'Muscles' on account of his slight stature, he won his first major titles, the Australian and French singles, in 1953 at the age of eighteen. At the close of the 1977 season, aged forty-three, he was still ranked number twelve in the game. Rosewall turned professional in 1957 and became the second player (after Rod Laver) to earn more than a million dollars from tennis, but the ban on professionals from 1957 to 1967 precluded his participation in many Grand Slam events. Asked about tennis in 1977 he said 'it's something I enjoy and find I still do well'. Rosewall was inducted into the international Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980, and its Australian counterpart in 1995.\\n\\nIreland-born Sinead Davies studied at the Byam Shaw School in London and moved to Sydney in 1983.

Promoted to principal artist at the end of 1969, four years later she and Kelvin Coe won silver medals at the Second International Ballet Competition in Moscow. She and Coe performed in New York and London, and became the first Australians to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi, Riga and Vilnius ballet companies. At the end of 1980, while pregnant, Rowe's husband died in an air crash. She went into seclusion, but when her baby was six months old, in response to demands from the dancers, she returned to the company as an adviser to the artistic director. Director of the Dancers' Company from 1984 to 1986, she was on the board of The Australian Ballet from 1994 to 2009, and was Director of The Australian Ballet School from 1999 to 2014.\\n\\nPainted in Graham Thorley's studio in Trentham, Victoria, this portrait dates from shortly after Rowe was widowed.

He achieved his first major success with 'Bring Larks and Heroes' (1967), a novel about the Vinegar Hill convict uprising of 1804, based on the writings of Watkin Tench. It won the Miles Franklin Award, as did his next novel, 'Three Cheers for the Paraclete' (1968). His 1972 novel, 'The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith', won several awards and was made into a film in 1978. In 1982 he became the first Australian author to win the Booker Prize, with 'Schindlerâ€™s Ark', filmed by Steven Spielberg as 'Schindlerâ€™s List' (1993). His numerous non-fiction titles include a biography of Abraham Lincoln, and books on aspects of Irish history including 'Now and in Time to Be' (1991) and 'The Great Shame' (1998). In 2014, he published 'Australians: Flappers to Vietnam', the third installment of a multi-volume history of Australia. His many novels include 'The Tyrantâ€™s Novel' (2004), 'The Widow and Her Hero' (2007), 'The Daughters of Mars' (2012) and, most recently, 'Crimes of the Father' (2016). \\n\\nLike the portraits of Don Bradman and Barry Humphries, this work was in Gordon Darlingâ€™s personal collection before he donated it to the National Portrait Gallery.",

The first draft, at the rate of, if possible, 1000 to 1500 words a day, but thatâ€™s not always possible.\\n\\nIâ€™m always having blackouts, losses of confidence, losses of vital energy. However, Iâ€™m convinced that the writing of a novel is not an inspirational business and can be done efficiently, and in fact must be done efficiently, by applying yourself to it every morning. I therefore attempt to write about at least 1000 words a morning. I write all morning â€“ this is for the past two years â€“ write all morning, go to school in the afternoon, come home, generally write again. I still am plagued by the good old Irish Catholic guilt and feel that I should work every night. But night work is usually ineffectual, disastrous, hard to settle to, not worth much when it is done. Of course, thereâ€™s no one way â€“ Iâ€™ve found this out by questioning, asking other novelists as I do shamelessly, specially to overseas visitors â€“ thereâ€™s no one way of writing a novel. And some people do, like myself, feel that once theyâ€™ve got that first draft done in totality, then theyâ€™ve got some chance of fixing the thing up and even adding extra material.",

Iâ€™m sure that sometimes itâ€™s nearly as crude as wanting to express the past and wanting to exorcise it in combination with wanting to be recognised as a good expresser and exorcisor of the past.\\n\\nI think the unlikely backgrounds that most novelists have is an indication of the possibility that they have taken to writing out of an attempt to adjust their own unsatisfactory lives, a sort of breaking new ground and adjusting to some almost indigestible break or disaster or failure in their past. Well to be frank, I know this is the reason I started writing, of course, to adjust a balance in my own life, to find a place, a voice in Australia. Since I began to get even the tiniest recognition as a writer, I felt I had a stake in Australia. For years after I left the seminary, until I did start to have work published, I felt an alien in the streets of Sydney. Itâ€™s a strange, brash city and itâ€™s a bad city to be an alien in. Itâ€™s only since Iâ€™ve started to, in particular since I got a sense of responsibility towards writing and began to see what direction Bring Larks and Heroes was travelling in and began to see that I might be expressing something of importance for Australians, that I felt a big stake in Australia, a place amongst the Australian people.",

Engaged before Mawson left for the perilous 1911 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, they eventually married in March 1914. Their first of their two daughters was born in 1915; she remained in Australia when Paquita went to England to assist Mawson in his wartime role with the Ministry of Munitions. Their second child was born in London in 1917. After the war, the family settled in Adelaide, where Paquita worked for the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association, including nine years as president, and the Australian Red Cross Society. Notable for her community work, Paquita was equally prominent in Adelaide's social and cultural life. She also wrote two books: biographies of her father, _A Vision of Steel_ (1958), and her husband, _Mawson of the Antarctic_ (1964).\\n\\nIt is thought that this portrait of Paquita Mawson came about when she was invited to pose for one of Ingrid Erns' art classes in Adelaide. In the portrait the sitter is striking and elegant, depicted seated and in profile, wearing an elaborate embroidered shawl. The painting remained in the Mawson family until being donated to the National Portrait Gallery in 2010.",

At age four, following her fatherâ€™s death, her mother took her family to Adelaide, where Ivy later trained as a seamstress. She then moved to Sydney, marrying financier Ray Shore in 1938. In the late 1950s, she enrolled in painting classes with Graeme Inson, a disciple of Max Meldrumâ€™s, and on separating from her husband in 1960 brought her own house in Woollahra. In 1962, soon after she was widowed, Inson moved in. Through the 1960s, Shore developed her own style as a portrait painter, but, not wanting to compete with Inson, eschewed entering the Archibald Prize. Instead, she focused her efforts on the Portia Geach Memorial Award for women artists, entering it for the first time in 1976 and winning in 1979 with a portrait of trade unionist Della Elliott. Shore used her prize-money to have a studio built above the garage of her house, so that she could paint away from Inson and his disapproval of her â€˜non-Meldrumiteâ€™ style. Shore continued to exhibit in the Portia Geach Award until 1992 and died in Sydney in 1999.",

Despite these challenges, Pecket determined on becoming an artist. From around 1934, and with financial assistance from the NSW Society for Crippled Children, she completed a diploma at East Sydney Technical College. Her solo exhibition in 1937 included over 60 works. She established a studio in Castlereagh Street, Sydney, where she painted and offered tuition. Later she focused on pottery, establishing a studio at her home in Ashfield, teaching, and producing a range of slip-cast decorative objects under the 'Christine Ware' label. In 1955 Pecket moved to her own home in Cammeray, where she later built a studio and returned to painting, sculpting and teaching.\\n\\nThis self portrait confirms accounts of Pecket's strong will and her dedication in the face of considerable obstacles. In a review of her graduating exhibition in the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 December 1937, she said: 'Disabilities are supposed to take everything from life, to leave it hollow and empty. But they don't. They make you try all the harder. One makes up one's mind to succeed despite the odds, and one does.' A photograph of Pecket at work on the portrait appeared alongside the article.",

He began work as a physics lecturer at the University of Melbourne in 1943, and made his first trip to the Antarctic with the 1947â€“1948 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition, as Senior Scientific Officer. He went on to participate in many exploratory voyages and oversaw the establishment of the Australian Antarctic Divisionâ€™s research stations â€“ Mawson, Casey and Davis. He was Director of the Antarctic Division of the Department of External Affairs from 1949 to 1966; during that period, he and his colleagues mapped more than 3000 miles of coastline and some 800 000 square miles of territory. Law's wife, Nel, was the first Australian woman to visit Antarctica. President of the Royal Society of Victoria from 1967 to 1969, Law was active for many years in tertiary education, marine science and public life, and authored several books about his Antarctic investigations and adventures. His honours include the Royal Geographical Society's Founders Medal, former recipients of which include Douglas Mawson and Jane Franklin. Law died at age 97; his ashes, and Nel's, were later interred near Mawson Station.",

During his career he openly supported marriage equality and voluntary euthanasia.

                    "content": "Trukanini (c. 1812â€“1876) is arguably nineteenth century Australiaâ€™s most celebrated Indigenous leader. A Nuennone woman and the daughter of Mangana, chief of the Recherche Bay people, Trukanini experienced the loss of her mother, sister and intended husband â€“ all as a result of white violence â€“ at a young age. Believing that she might be able to assist in protecting her people, in 1829 Trukanini joined the group of Palawa leaders associated with George Augustus Robinson, an evangelically-inclined free settler who'd been appointed to effect the removal of Tasmania's Aboriginal people to a mission station, Wybalenna, on Flinders Island in Bass Strait. Trukanini remained one of Robinson's most important companions throughout the course of his so-called 'Friendly Mission', the name given to a series of journeys conducted by Robinson between 1830 and 1835. Trukanini went to Wybalenna in 1835, but held to her traditional ways despite the expectation that the Aboriginal people there would adopt European customs and religion. She travelled with Robinson in 1839 to the Port Phillip district, where she later engaged with four others in raids against white settlers. She returned to Flinders Island in 1842; when Wybalenna closed in 1847, Trukanini was among the remaining residents relocated to Oyster Cove, a former convict depot south of Hobart and close to her traditional country. Trukanini died in Hobart in May 1876. As she had feared, her skeleton was stolen from her grave and later displayed at the Tasmanian Museum. The Tasmanian Aboriginal community eventually won the fight to have her wishes honoured: her bones were cremated on the 30th of April 1976 and the following day her ashes were scattered with due ceremony on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Trukanini was erroneously referred to during her lifetime and beyond as the â€˜last Tasmanianâ€™ â€“ a false notion attested to by the many descendants of her contemporaries still living in Tasmania today.\\n\\nSheffield-born sculptor Benjamin Law (1807â€“1890) arrived in Hobart as an assisted immigrant in February 1835. He became acquainted with George Augustus Robinson soon afterwards and through him met Wurati, Trukanini's partner. Despite being advised that â€˜the Colony [was] too youngâ€™ for him to make a living as a sculptor, Law recognised that there was demand for likenesses of Aboriginal people: a demand driven in part by the colonistsâ€™ belief that Tasmaniaâ€™s Aboriginal people were destined to disappear. Lawâ€™s bust of Wurati â€“ considered the first portrait sculpture created in Australia â€“ was completed within two months of Law arriving in Hobart. Copies of the bust were available at four pounds four shillings each and, according to Lawâ€™s first wife, Hannah, were â€˜called for not only in all Quarters of the Colony, but are being sent to India, to Sweden, to England, Scotland â€¦ and Cambridge Collegeâ€™. In 1836, Law commenced his portrait of Trukanini and by October that year announced that he had â€˜several duplicates ready for delivery, either in bronze or stone colourâ€™. The portraits of Trukanini and Wurati were valued for their â€˜correctnessâ€™ and sold well, but Lawâ€™s output as a sculptor (which included a bust of Robinson) did not earn him a sufficient living. With Hannah, he worked as the head of Hobartâ€™s Infant School and at Port Arthur before opening a store in Hobart in 1840 that, along with his subsequent business enterprises, proved somewhat unsuccessful. During the 1840s, Law acquired property at Westbury in northern Tasmania. He died at Westbury in October 1890, survived by his fourth wife.",

The three dimensional, cast plaster bust is slightly smaller than lifesize. Approx 60 cm high, 40 cm wide and 25 cm deep, Trucaninnyâ€™s bust depicts her head and torso and ends, cropped at her upper arm. The bust is painted jet black, which has a low sheen and is mounted on a cast plaster stand, or socle, which is also black. The simple squat cylindrical stand has a curvaceous form â€“ rounded collar, narrower stem and wider base. \\n\\nHer hair is short with tight curls. Her head is tilted slightly downwards. Her solemn face is broad with strong features. She has a short forehead, strong brow and deep-set eyes. Her gaze is intense. Her prominent cheekbones, either side of her broad nose, give her cheeks a rounded appearance in contrast to the deep-set eyes. She has a full mouth, with an emphasis on the cleft running between her nose and upper lip. She holds her mouth closed, and this, together with her fixed gaze, gives Trucaninny a quiet fortitude. Her square chin is asymmetrical, with an indent slightly left-of-centre. \\n\\nAround her neck, Trucaninny wears a necklace of tiny conical maireener shells laced together. The necklace lies flat against her skin with the narrow ends of the shells pointing outwards. The long strand is wound around her neck twice, resting on her collarbone and lower in the centre of her chest. \\n\\nTrucaninnyâ€™s shoulders are rolled forwards slightly, matching the downward tilt of her head and the direction of her gaze. From her right shoulder, draped low across her chest and under her left arm she wears an animal skin. The skin, irregular in shape, is twisted around itself, gaping to reveal her right breast and nipple. The drapes and folds show both sides of the animal skin â€“ the thick furred texture in contrast with the smooth underside. A triangle of fur hangs long over her right breast and past the end of the bust.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Emily Casey and voiced by Carol Wellman Kelly**",

In 1829 Wurati decided to join the party associated with George Augustus Robinson (1788â€“1866), a free settler and lay preacher appointed to the position of â€˜Conciliator of Aboriginesâ€™ so as to effect the removal of Tasmaniaâ€™s Indigenous people to Flinders Island in Bass Strait. This strategy had been conceived by the colonial government, amidst escalating hostilities, for the supposed protection of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities alike. Accompanied by a group of Aboriginal leaders who acted as his guides and interpreters, Robinson conducted a series of expeditions â€“ collectively known as the Friendly Mission â€“ between 1830 and 1835, during which the surviving tribes were persuaded into exile. Wurati and his second wife, Trukanini, became Robinsonâ€™s trusted assistants, yet remained fiercely proud of their traditions and identity. Wurati refused to adopt European diet or dress and maintained traditional practices, such as the use of ochre and grease for his hair and beard, even while at Wybalenna â€“ the mission station on Flinders Island to which over one hundred Tasmanian Aboriginal people were eventually exiled. Many died there while waiting for the fulfilment of the promise that they would be allowed to return to their country. In 1839, Wurati was one of the fourteen Tasmanians who went to Port Phillip following Robinsonâ€™s appointment to the position of Chief Protector of Aborigines in the new colony. He died on his return journey to Wybalenna in July 1842. \\n\\nWurati sat for this portrait in Hobart in 1835 having been introduced by Robinson to sculptor Benjamin Law. Robinson recalled that: â€˜Woureddy sat for his portrait with great patience and was highly pleased with the model.â€™ Copies of the bust were available at four pounds four shillings each and, according to Lawâ€™s wife, Hannah, were â€˜called for not only in all Quarters of the Colony, but are being sent to India, to Sweden, to England, Scotland â€¦ and Cambridge Collegeâ€™. This work and the bust of Trukanini, completed by Law in Hobart in 1836, are the earliest known portrait sculptures of Australian subjects.",

In 1921 the family moved to Melbourne, where they were to operate the Lindrum billiard hall for decades. Walter and his brother were coached by their father, Frederick, who, according to Walter, was the best billiard player in the pre-World War 1 world. Walterâ€™s brother Frederick, too, was brilliant at the game, but fate saw Walter emerge as the dominant player internationally. In 1929 he went to England, where he quickly established himself as the greatest the world had seen. He made his largest competitive break, of 4 137, in 1932. The 1930s were his peak years; he won the world billiards championship in 1933 and retained the title throughout the decade. In the 1940s, he abandoned competitive play. Apart from writing about billiards, in his later years he applied himself to raising funds for Melbourne charities. His much-visited grave in Melbourne General Cemetery is in the form of a billiards tabletop, complete with cue and balls. \\n\\nWill Longstaff (1879â€“1953) grew up in Ballarat, where he studied art at the School of Mines before embarking for the Boer War. Proceeding to Europe, he attended art school in London. He joined the Australian Imperial Force in 1915, serving in Egypt before being invalided to England, where he was appointed a war artist and worked in camouflage and the Australian War Records Section. His best-known painting, Menin Gate at Midnight (1927) hangs in a curtained shrine-like space in the Australian War Memorial. A resident of England for the rest of his life, Longstaff undertook many portrait commissions. He is thought to have painted Lindrum in London in 1932, the year Lindrum made his record break.",

Fleeing from Nazi Germany to Paris when he was seventeen, he changed his name to Georges Mora. During the war he took an active role in the Resistance; when peace came, he worked as a patent dealer. He married Mirka Zelik, a French-born Jewish artist, in 1947 and the couple migrated to Melbourne with their first son, Philippe in 1951. Two more sons, William and Tiriel, followed. Soon the couple became friends with the cityâ€™s leading artists and collectors, including the Reeds, and were instrumental in the re- formation of the Contemporary Art Society. Over the course of the 1950s and 1960s they opened the European-style Mirka CafÃ© in Exhibition Street (the first Melbourne cafÃ© with outdoor seating), the Balzac in East Melbourne (the first restaurant with a licence to serve liquor after 10pm) and the Tolarno in St Kilda. While Georges established himself as an art dealer as well as a restaurateur, Mirka became a Bohemian icon of the city. The couple separated in the early 1970s. In 1985 Georges married another artist, Caroline Williams, and they had a son, Sam, born in the same year. Made a Chevalier des Arts et Lettres in 1989, Georges was still operating the Tolarno Gallery in South Yarra when he died. William Mora can lay claim to being one of only three second-generation art dealers in business in Australia today. The Georges Mora Foundation, launched by Dame Elisabeth Murdoch in 2006, is a not-for-profit cultural foundation dedicated to the promotion of contemporary art and artists in Melbourne and Australia.\\n\\nThis portrait is one of three that Charles Blackman made when he and Georges Mora were working together at the Eastbourne Cafe (later the Balzac). Blackmanâ€™s former wife, Barbara, comments that it is akin to a self portrait, as she recalls that artist and sitter looked very alike.",

After learning watercolour technique, he was persuaded to exhibit his work in Melbourne in 1938. The exhibition sold out in two days. During the 1940s his work became fashionable throughout Australia and he was the subject of a biography and a film. In 1954 he met the Queen in Canberra, and he was awarded citizenship status in 1957. One of the consequences of citizenship was that Namatjira was legally entitled to buy alcohol, but when he shared it with his fellow Arrernte, as custom required, he was sentenced to imprisonment. Although the sentence was commuted, he never recovered, and died the following year. Nearly 50 years after his death, Namatjira remains the best-known of Australian Aboriginal painters.\\n\\nThe prolific portraitist Sir William Dargie CBE (1912â€“2003) knew, and had painted with, Albert Namatjira. In 1956 Dargie won one of his eight Archibald Prizes with a portrait of Namatjira, whose â€˜tremendous inner dignity,â€™ he said, contributed to â€˜the most wonderful face for a portrait Iâ€™ve ever seenâ€™.",

His figure takes up most of the composition against a distant desert background. \\n\\nThe bright blue desert sky fills the top two thirds of the background around and above Namatjira. In lively and breezy, mostly vertical, strokes, the painted sky starts in bold cerulean at the top of the painting and fades to sapphire and powder blue where it meets the distant purple mountains. Some horizontal paint strokes hint at faint clouds.\\n\\nLand occupies the lower third of the background. In the far distance a blurred mountain range of purples and dark blue runs along the horizon. The flat dirt is rendered in pale peachy oranges. Small blue green dashes and dots of paint suggest sparse and distant vegetation.\\n\\nNamatjira's seated figure, cropped at the shins, fills the foreground. His head is positioned in profile facing the left. His skin is warm shades of dark brown and umber. He has short black hair, thick and wavy, flecked with grey, which neatly follows the shape of his large ear. His forehead angles diagonally toward his prominent brow, creased gently with wrinkles. He has a bushy raised eyebrow, and deeply set brown eye gazing into the distance. His nose is straight and upturned, his mouth slightly open. He has strong cheekbones leading to plump jowls and a thick neck, around which sits a thin red bandana tucked into his white button-up shirt.\\n\\nNamatjira's body is turned slightly towards the left, following his gaze. His left arm is bent at the elbow, the forearm leaning casually on his left thigh, his hand and fingers gently hanging down. Between this hand and his raised right hand, he gently holds a sketch of a landscape, resting on his lap, and angled away from his body. The paper faces towards us directly, showing a watery sketch of a landscape scene. A large tree on the right with grey green foliage, bright blue mountains in the background and pale peachy orange dirt in the foreground. \\n\\nNamatjira has dark taupe pants, his knees are parted, and he sits on a low reddish-brown rock.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Marina Neilson and voiced by Lucie Shawcross, 2021**",

After living for a time in Shanghai, she moved to Bombay early in World War 2. There, she became the editor of the Onlooker, a monthly glossy magazine, and moved in political and artistic circles, meeting Nehru, Gandhi and Tata. She married David Johnston-Bell, who was serving with Lord Mountbatten; they became friends with the Langhammers, and collected works by the artists in the Progressive School. After moving to Australia in 1950 the Johnston-Bells bought magazines including The Australian Collector, which under Andree's editorship soon became something of a collector's item in itself. One of her triumphs was the publication of previously-unseen engravings of botanical specimens collected by Banks and Solander. In retirement, she translated seventeenth-century French manuscripts. \\n\\nWalter Langhammer fled the Nazis in Austria for India, becoming first art director of the Times of India in about 1936. He was soon surrounded by an 'in crowd' of fellow European refugees - professionals, artists, doctors and industrialists - who became important patrons of contemporary artists in Bombay.",

The son of a doctor, Elliott grew up in Bellingen, New South Wales, and was educated at Scot's College in Sydney. After war service with the Royal Australian Navy, he studied medicine at the University of Sydney, and decided to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology in 1950 after witnessing Betty Sara become the first Australian woman to be successfully delivered of quadruplets (Elliot's father delivered them). Having undertaken further study in London, in due course he became head of gynaecological oncology at Sydneyâ€™s King George V Hospital, and president of both the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Asian and Oceanic Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. For many years, Elliott worked as a volunteer in Asia and Oceania; and during his career he published over 150 research papers and delivered more than 250 lectures by invitation. In his spare time, he pursued his passion for art collecting, enjoying close relationships with gallery owners and artists, including Fred Williams, William Robinson, Frank Hodgkinson and Russell Drysdale.\\n\\nElliott commissioned this portrait from artist Jon Molvig in 1964. It was gifted to the National Portrait Gallery by the sitter's son in 2016, along with five of Molvig's preparatory drawings for the work.",

Vickery graduated in biochemistry from the University of Melbourne in 1925, and fours year later earned a PhD from Cambridge, where he worked in the Low Temperature Research Laboratory. In 1929 he went as a biologist on a scientific survey party, sent from England at the request of the New Zealand government, to examine and report on aspects of the export lamb trade. Two years later he became officer in charge of the food preservation and transport section of CSIR at Cannon Hill, Brisbane. The primary objective of the section was to find a viable way to send chilled beef to Britain. In 1938 the section moved to Sydney, where further research into cold storage of diverse foods was carried out. In 1940 the section was raised to the status of a division with Vickery as its chief. In the next few years, owing to demands for supplies from the American forces in the Pacific, the section was expanded.; Vickery became the man in demand as wartime food supply problems intensified, and dehydrated meat for Allied forces became known as â€˜Vickery muttonâ€™. Vickery was careful to maintain close relations with the food industry, fostering good practice and innovation. He set up an education committee to implement the the first food technology courses in Australia at Hawkesbury Agricultural College and Sydney Technical College, and encouraged his staff to teach in them. Having travelled widely to observe food research establishments in many countries, Vickery became internationally recognised as one of the fathers of his profession; he was a member of the international committee that initiated the International Union of Food Science and Technology (IUFoST) and an honorary fellow of the UK Institute of Food Science and Technology. The Institute of Food Technologists conferred on him its International Award for 1960 for _â€˜outstanding efforts to promote international exchange of ideas in the field of food technologyâ€™_. By the time he retired in 1967, the division was housed in new laboratories at North Ryde and Cannon Hill. In retirement Vickery returned to the laboratory, publishing original research on cyclopropenoid fatty acids which cause pink/white disorder in eggs. In 1990 he published his comprehensive book _Food Science and Technology in Australia. Warmly remembered for his integrity, commitment and enlightened administration, he is commemorated in the JR Vickery Address, delivered at the annual convention of the Australian Institute of Food Science and Technology._ __",

After immigrating, he worked as a waiter while studying fashion design at East Sydney TAFE and Sydneyâ€™s National Art School. In 1993 he opened the Akira Isogawa boutique in Woollahra, and swiftly established a reputation for his bold and intelligent clothes. At Sydneyâ€™s Australian Fashion Week in 1996, he sent all his models out wearing red socks from Gowings because he couldnâ€™t afford shoes for them; but he has shown at every Fashion Week since, and since 1998 he has shown twice annually in Paris. He has exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art, and Sydneyâ€™s Object Galleryâ€™s exhibition of his construction techniques is said to have been its most successful ever show. The National Gallery of Victoriaâ€™s _Akira Isogawa: Printemps EtÃ©_ in 2004-2005 was the first solo exhibition of an Australian designerâ€™s work to be shown at one of its major art institutions and later toured to Singapore, Manila and Bangkok. In 2005 Isogawa was depicted on the â€˜Australian Legendsâ€™ series of postage stamps and in 2007 he was named the countryâ€™s first Fashion Laureate. He has designed costumes for four Sydney Dance Company productions and for the Australian Balletâ€™s production of Graeme Murphyâ€™s _Romeo and Juliet_ in 2010. Sydneyâ€™s Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences showed the retrospective _Akira Isogawa_ at 2018-2019. Since the Woollahra boutique closed in 2017, Australiaâ€™s only two Akira boutiques are in the Strand Arcade, Sydney, and Fortitude Valley, Brisbane.",

Well now actually I create fashion. But back then, actually, I was consuming fashion and that's how much I loved [it].  \\nJapanese culture is so different from Western ones. My grandparents had a house next door. They were all wearing actually traditional clothes â€“ kimono. What I noticed about kimono is actually they're made out rectangular shaped cloth. And they have no shapes. Whereas actually, Western clothes has a particular shape that enhance, particularly actually for female, the femininity of female body, but whereas actually kimono is totally unisex. I mean, I've never actually designed kimono myself. But being a kimono designer, I imagine actually, they work on texture, colour, print, and so on, because it's a highly textile driven fashion, and then to me, that's what Japanese fashion is all about. You know, when I design my own collection, I never really force myself to express my Japanese entity, but I feel that it just comes up naturally. And I think what's interesting is that not just, you know, designing something so traditionally Japanese, but then I kind of actually manage to fuse with Australian ease I guess actually. Australia has got this particular attitude â€“ friendly to start with â€“ but it's quite actually casual about things, you know. I feel actually my design is a result of actually, you know, some Japanese heritage with Australian attitude, which is actually friendly and easy.",

After arriving in Australia in 1980 she worked as a translator of Chinese language films and with ABC radio in Darwin and Newcastle before joining SBS as a newsreader in 1988, gaining devoted viewers through her stern delivery and superbly-cut tops and jackets. As host of the network's _Fashionista_ program she built a reputation as a style authority, in 2008 curating the National Archives of Australia exhibition of historical fashion photographs, _Strike a Pose â€¦ With Lee Lin Chin_. Known also as a comedian and a voice for social change, she has a huge social media following although she posts little, if anything, herself, retaining an intriguing air of mystery. Among the causes Chin supports is The Social Studio, an enterprise dedicated to creating employment and educational pathways for young people who have been refugees.\\n\\nPhotographer Ingvar Kenne spent a couple of hours with Lee Lin Chin in her friend's painting studio, and they went outside late in the afternoon so he could take 'one last shot' â€“ this one. He recalls 'we all ended up at the pub afterwards exchanging tales.' She is pictured in a dress by Japanese-born Australian designer Akira Isogawa.",

It was then that I really did start to work. He was a wonderful teacher. He realised I was an unconventional, peculiar sort of person really, and he rather encouraged it, not always approving but always sympathetic and helpful. It was there that I met my present husband, who has always been a help to me, with his encouragement and criticism and so on, George Duncan.\\n\\nI worked seriously for years and years and from that day to now Iâ€™ve never ceased to paint.\\n\\nWithin the last few years, Iâ€™ve been extraordinarily interested in an ecological approach, which is the balance of life and place. I wanted to balance my subjects with something behind it, something deeper behind it. I think my early childhood feelings about trying to get behind things had something to do with it. Itâ€™s always been with me, always been interested in the other side of things. But somehow or other itâ€™s terribly difficult to get right behind things, as I think every artist should do. After all, itsâ€™ not just a superficial rendering of the things we see in front of us, itâ€™s trying to get the spirit behind all that and join it up with something, another life that isnâ€™t quite only of this world, and I expect I shall go along those lines for quite a while yet.\\n\\nUsually, when Iâ€™m painting anything at all, things come to me. Iâ€™m slightly psychic, and things come to me in that peculiar period just between waking and sleeping. I see the whole composition, the colour scheme, the feeling of the thing, but I have to work out the detail, of course, physically, myself, afterwards; but the whole general feeling of the thing usually comes to me, and I never start an important work unless that happens because I find itâ€™s never any use at all.",

This came a year after Victoria granted women â€“ but not Aboriginal women â€“ the right to vote in 1908, and the same year the Society of Women Painters was established, with the 27-year-old Rodway a founding member.\\n\\nRodwayâ€™s talents were recognised early by her parents, who sent her to study art at Hobart Technical School. In 1902, she was awarded a Royal Academy scholarship and studied for four years in London under visiting masters, including John Singer Sargent, before settling in Sydney and furthering her training with Julian Ashton. Her portraits were highly sought after; she completed commissions for soprano Dame Nellie Melba and poet Henry Lawson.\\n\\nAlthough celebrated for her work in pastels, in 1919 Rodway was commissioned by the Art Gallery of New South Wales to paint in oil the ailing JF Archibald, a trustee of the Gallery since 1915. Despite the death of her subject that year, Rodway completed the work using direct sketches made during sittings. This was one of three portraits Rodway submitted for the inaugural award, alongside portrayals of Julian Ashton and chief justice Sir William Portus Cullen.",

After training at Melbourneâ€™s National Gallery School under Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall, he spent two years in Europe absorbing the work of Rembrandt, VelÃ¡zquez and Hals. After returning to Australia, he took up the post of drawing instructor at the Gallery School, becoming its head in 1934, and was acting director of the National Gallery of Victoria from 1935 to 1936.\\n\\nWith his wife, fellow artist Violet McInnes, he settled in the Melbourne suburb of Alphington, where Annear had lived. McInnesâ€™ arts and craftsâ€“styled villa, â€˜The Poplarsâ€™, was designed by Annear, who called for a shared vision in Australian domestic architecture, emphasising the forms of medieval art and imagery of nature, and forging the disciplines of art, architecture and craft.\\n\\nHighly praised by critics at the time, the portrait shows the 56-year-old Annear settled beside a table littered with architectural drawings and items from his renowned collection of objets dâ€™art.",

Instead, she submitted this portrait of her father-in-law, retired 73-year-old physician John Shera.\\n\\nReflecting in 2021, Allen wrote:\\n\\nâ€˜One day I arrived unannounced while he was pottering about in the garden half naked! Instead of him quickly disappearing, he kept watering; unperturbed! On this day I was struck by an intimacy that was the linchpin to my returning with pencils and drawing pad to examine more closely the subject for a painting. I noticed his back was covered with seborrheic keratosis, which in turn I painted as thick brown blobs of paint. The final touch was bashing the green paint background of the painting with a branch off his celtis tree! It was a painting driven by emotion ...â€™",

Holding her first solo show at the gallery in 1975, Varvaressos remained part of its stable of artists until it closed in 2018.\\n\\nWhen Watters died, he was widely remembered for his loyalty to artists, his ethics and his advocacy for experimental art practice. Varvaressos wrote:\\n\\nâ€˜I painted Frank in his apartment. He had just had his chair upholstered and I included a few of his many colourful objects. His walls (until recently) were always painted pink. When I was reminded of this painting decades later, I was surprised at the bright colours as I often am when seeing my early work. I was also struck by the slightly melancholic air about Frank. Although I had not been aware of it at the time, I later came to think that it captured something about him.â€™\\n\\nThat year was the second time no award was given (the first in 1964), with the trustees deciding to withhold the prize.",

Winner of the Peopleâ€™s Choice on three occasions, his subjects include former prime ministers Paul Keating (1998) and Malcolm Fraser (2010), as well as eight self-portraits. His courageous 2007 self-portrait was painted while recovering from life-threatening tongue cancer.\\n\\nLargely self-taught, Hannaford took up painting full-time in 1970, encouraged by artists Hans Heysen and Ivor Hele, the latter a five-time Archibald winner. Rejecting contemporary trends in abstraction, Hannaford embraced realism, stating, â€˜I do try to capture the real, the accurate, colours, tones, shapes and movements in my visual field. In fact, this is what excites me more than anythingâ€™.\\n\\nHannafordâ€™s 1995 Archibald portrait depicts Wangkajunga and Walmajarri painter, printmaker and preacher Jarinyanu David Downs, shortly before his death in 1995. Born in the Great Sandy Desert around 1925, Downs was considered one of the leading lights of the contemporary Aboriginal art movement. Downsâ€™ works express his strongly held Christian beliefs coupled with representations of Walmajarri story cycles and specific cultural sites.",

After the war he completed his studies, but soon returned to Waiben where he began painting scenes of island life, for which he is best known.\\n\\nIn 1969, Crooke â€“ together with pilot and explorer Percy Trezise and Kunhanaamendaa artist Goobalathaldin (Dick Roughsey) â€“ began a search for the historical goldrush site Hells Gate, in the Kennedy Creek region of Cape York Peninsula. That same year Crooke won the Archibald Prize with a portrait of his close friend, novelist George Johnston. \\n\\nBorn on Langunarnji Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria around 1920, Goobalathaldin was encouraged throughout his career by Trezise â€“ with whom he collaborated â€“ and Crooke, successfully exhibiting bark paintings and oils, and creating illustrated childrenâ€™s books. In 1971 his book Moon and rainbow was the first published autobiography by a First Nations person and, in 1973, he became the first chair of the Aboriginal Arts Board. In his 1982 Archibald work, Crooke depicts the artist in his studio, surrounded by his works celebrating Kunhanaamendaa culture and traditions. Goobalathaldin died in 1985.",

She travelled to London in 1923, studying at the Central School of Arts and Crafts under Bernard Meninsky, who instilled in her a lifelong interest in colour. After a brief sojourn in Australia, Ellis taught drawing at the technical and high schools in Papaioea, where she studied under Harry Linley Richardson.\\n\\nIn 1934, Ellis returned to Australia, enrolling in the classes of Italian Ã©migrÃ© artist Antonio Dattilo-Rubbo (1870â€“1955), an early supporter of modernism in Sydney. Ellis held a two-woman show in 1938 with Dora Toovey, and by 1941 was appointed principal of Dattilo-Rubboâ€™s art school, where she remained until 1949.\\n\\nInfluenced by the post-impressionist teachings of Dattilo-Rubbo, Ellis greatly admired Paul CÃ©zanne and her work reflects a cubist approach in its use of faceting and colour divisions. This portrait of the â€˜maestroâ€™ received his highest praise; Dattilo-Rubbo wrote: \\n\\nâ€˜â€¦ you have achieved the best by a good composition, supported by strong drawing, virile colour and excellent touch. It is a well-balanced work, and I heartily congratulate you with my good wishes to see the painting hanged in [a] worthy art gallery â€“ if possible, in your native land.â€™",

Cohn was a pioneer in Australia, fashioning colossal modernist sculptures, hand-carved in stone. Described by writer and friend Barbara Blackman (the subject of the 1997 winning portrait by Nigel Thomson) as â€˜a big flour bag of a woman, healthy as bread, strong as a millstoneâ€™, Cohn had a studio-home that was a meeting place for Melbourneâ€™s artistic community. It was here that Jean Goldberg and Cohn met in 1956, becoming close friends.\\n\\nGoldberg studied nursing at Royal Melbourne Hospital, graduating in 1948. In the 1950s, she became a passionate advocate for human rights and protested social injustice. Taking life classes with Cohn in the mid 1950s, Goldberg then studied at George Bellâ€™s studio from 1956 to 1959. She later learned needlepoint lacemaking while working as a librarian at the Embroiderersâ€™ Guild, Victoria. Goldberg went on to create idiosyncratic and witty lace pieces from everyday subjects, including newspaper advertisements for cars.\\n\\nIn her only Archibald Prize work, Goldberg fills the canvas with Cohnâ€™s forceful presence, the stocky figure and tousled grey hair built up with thick daubs of paint. Cohnâ€™s vocation is distinguished by one of her sculptures, shown in the background.",

Having studied sculpture at Londonâ€™s Central School of Arts and Crafts, in 1947 Beadle became an instructor at the East Sydney Technical College (ESTC) Strathfield campus. An influential educator, he also taught at Newcastle Art School and his public art can be seen across Newcastle. In 1961, Beadle settled in Aotearoa New Zealand, where he became known for his figurative, lost-wax cast sculptures.\\n\\nNovocastrian Jon Molvig was a soldier in New Guinea and the Philippines during World War II and was a student under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme at ESTC, where he met Beadle. After graduation, Molvig left Sydney in 1951 for Europe, where he studied the work of modern masters such as Pierre Bonnard and Edvard Munch. His highly individual works encompass the genres of portraiture, landscape and, in his final years, abstraction.\\n\\nMolvig painted Beadle the year after the sculptor completed his most celebrated commission â€“ the 11-metre-high eagle and sphere surmounting the Australianâ€“American Memorial in Canberra. It was the first of 11 Archibald portraits by Molvig (he won in 1966 with his portrayal of artist Charles Blackman) and was painted the year Molvig left Sydney for Brisbane, where he remained until his death, aged just 46.",

It was the first self-portrait by a female artist to win, and one of four self-portraits Sharpe exhibited in the Archibald from 1994 to 2020.\\n\\nSharpeâ€™s influences are broad, including expressionist painters Max Beckmann, Edvard Munch and Emil Nolde, and Australian artists Arthur Boyd and Kevin Connor. Her exuberant, richly coloured canvases are filled with the epicurean bodies of stage performers, with dramatic lighting creating evocative settings for her figures. In 1993, she wrote: \\n\\nâ€˜a figurative artist acts as a kind of stage magician theatrically conjuring up people and places. Ideas, experiences are personified, or made visible; the incorporeal is metamorphosised into human, ghost or allegorical figures.â€™\\n\\nA graduate of City Art Institute (now UNSW Art & Design), Sharpe has held over 70 solo exhibitions. In 1999, she was appointed an official war artist â€“ the first woman since World War II â€“ assigned with troops in East Timor.",

A century after the inaugural Archibald Prize, the notion that a personâ€™s identity may be revealed in portraiture through codified cultural designs has progressively become accepted practice.\\n\\nAn artist at Tjala Arts on Aá¹‰angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands, Tjungkara Ken, with the Ken Sisters Collaborative, won the 2016 Wynne Prize for landscape painting, with their work depicting the Seven Sisters. As the sisters are being chased across Country by an evil man named Wati Nyiru, they work together to avoid falling for his tricks. Wati Nyiru can change shape into different rock formations and landmarks. These sites, which Ken paints, remain part of the landscape and are cared for by the artist and her family. In her Archibald self-portrait, Ken also paints the Seven Sisters, coalescing the genres of landscape and portraiture.\\n\\nIn 2015, Ken said, â€˜I hold my fatherâ€™s story, I hold my motherâ€™s story â€¦ [it] doesnâ€™t come out of paper or out of a book.

Janet â€“ whose stage name was Barbara Russell â€“ holds one hand across her heart while the other clutches sheet music, presumably arrangements written by her husband, who had set Brennanâ€™s poetry to music. Words from the poem â€˜I am shut out of mine own heartâ€™ can be discerned. It was the last song the couple performed. \\n\\nThe Keatses lived in Mosman on Sydneyâ€™s North Shore, where Toovey also resided. The artist had studied in Sydney with Antonio Dattilo-Rubbo, who is included in Archie 100 as a sitter. Inspired by Nora Heysenâ€™s 1938 win, Toovey determined to study portraiture, stating, â€˜When I saw that it was possible for a woman to win, I decided to try my hardest and went straight to Melbourne where I studied for my diploma in portraiture at the Melbourne National Galleryâ€™. Her marriage to artist James R Jackson â€“ an Archibald artist in 1922 with two portraits â€“ was strained while Toovey was working on this portrait, which conveys an overwhelming feeling of grief and melancholy and foreshadows Toovey and Jacksonâ€™s divorce two years later.",

In it, he alludes to both the impact the Australian landscape has borne on his work, as well as the passage of time as he approached his eighties. The work references the ancient Roman god of beginnings, transitions and ending. Responding to his win, Olsen said: â€˜Janus had the ability to look backwards and forwards and when you get to my age you have a hell of a lot to think aboutâ€™. Contemplative and full of raw intensity, the tracery of lines that emblematically map out the artistâ€™s life journey â€“ traversing his six-decade-long career â€“ appear fragile, as if fading into oblivion.\\n\\nOlsenâ€™s association with the Archibald goes back to 1952, when he joined a group of art students at the Gallery protesting William Dargieâ€™s seventh Archibald win (for a portrait of BHP chairman Essington Lewis). Holding a placard that read â€˜Archibald decisions death to art!â€™, Olsen gave three cheers for Picasso, and left. The protest led to a term limit for Gallery trustees. Years later, Olsen himself became a Gallery trustee and, by default, an Archibald judge. In yet another Archibald controversy, Olsen had been the favourite to win the 1989 prize for his work DÃ³nde voy? Self-portraits in moments of doubt. Instead, the award went to Bryan Westwood for his portrait of art critic and artist Elwyn Lynn.",

His first â€“ Self-portrait in the studio 1976 â€“ marked a formative moment in the history of the award, which challenged the definition of portraiture.\\n\\nIn Art, life and the other thing â€“ a brutally honest confession of his heroin addiction â€“ Whiteley not only defied traditional canons of likeness and realism, he also confronted the Archibaldâ€™s own fraught history. In the central panel, Whiteley holds a drawing of William Dobellâ€™s infamous 1943 Archibald-winning portrait of fellow artist Joshua Smith, his own torso elongated in deference to Dobell. To the left, a baboon howls as a ghostly hand offers a syringe. On the right is a photograph of Whiteley, seemingly high. Commenting on Whiteleyâ€™s work during this period, the artist Donald Friend wrote: â€˜His paintings are like wonderful glimpses of the world seen through holes in the death-wishâ€™. Sadly, Whiteley died in a hotel room from an overdose in 1992.\\n\\nIn 1978, Whiteley not only won the Archibald, but also the Wynne Prize for landscape painting and the Sulman Prize for genre painting â€“ the only artist to date to win the trifecta.",

Tuckerâ€™s often grim imagery depicts the devastation he experienced through the Great Depression and World War II. With no formal training, he studied reproductions of works by post-impressionist and expressionist artists in the cityâ€™s public library. During his army service, he created potent images of the physical and mental traumas he witnessed in patients at Victoriaâ€™s Heidelberg Military Hospital in 1942. Meeting esteemed psychiatrist Dr Reginald Ellery, Tucker began exploring the intersection between psychology and creativity.\\n\\nAs Tucker was an avid reader of the stream-of-consciousness poetry of TS Eliot, it was almost inevitable that he crossed paths with the poet Max Dunn (c1895â€“1963), an enigmatic figure in Australian literature. Dunn went by various names â€“ most of them invented â€“ and later became president of the Buddhist Society of Victoria. He self-published his Eliot-inspired poems in the 1940s to a largely bewildered public. Tuckerâ€™s portrait is imbued with a dark undercurrent: Dunnâ€™s gaunt features are exaggerated, while his body emerges from a shadowy background. Broad, agitated brushstrokes conjure the â€˜social-psychological landscapeâ€™ Tucker sought to embody in each of his portraits.\\n\\nThis was one of two portraits by Tucker in the 1945 Archibald; the other â€“ an intense self-portrait â€“ was the last of three self-portraits he exhibited in the competition.",

Awarded a travelling art scholarship in 1920, she attended Londonâ€™s Royal Academy under Walter Sickert, later working in Paris. In Sydney, she established herself as an artist and role model for generations of artists, both through the Adelaide Perry School of Art and her 30-year-tenure as art mistress at Presbyterian Ladiesâ€™ College, Croydon. In 2001, the Adelaide Perry Gallery was established at PLC Sydney (as the girls school is now known) and every year hosts the Adelaide Perry Prize for Drawing.\\n\\nIn the interwar period, Perry exhibited with Contemporary Group artists, including Margaret Preston and Grace Cossington Smith, whose work represents the first significant wave of modernist culture in Australia. She was also a member of the more established Society of Artists and later the Australian Academy of Art, thereby traversing Sydneyâ€™s contemporary and conservative artistic milieu. Perryâ€™s portraits are characterised by her commitment to realist techniques, with impeccable draughtsmanship, tonal modelling and an emphasis on form, using crisp outlines.",

By the 1950s, reproductions of Namatjiraâ€™s watercolours of his Country adorned the walls of Australian middle-class homes.\\n\\nBorn at Ntaria (Hermannsburg) on Western Arrernte Country â€“ and briefly tutored by artist Rex Battarbee â€“ Namatjira laid the foundations for the Hermannsburg painting movement. Dargie admired his defiance of bureaucracy and exploitation, and First Nations artists today â€“ including his great-grandson Vincent Namatjira â€“ are stirred by his legacy. In 1957, Namatjira was the first Aboriginal person granted Australian citizenship. Despite his artistic success, Namatjira died broken-spirited, aged 57 years, his anguish and resilience perceptible in this portrait.\\n\\nDargie trained under Archibald Colquhoun â€“ who had 36 portraits in the Archibald Prize between 1926 and 1960 â€“ and Napier Waller at Melbourne Technical College. However, he was most inspired by the work of John Longstaff. Dargie was rewarded by Archibald judges eight times between 1941 and 1956 â€“ a record unmatched in the prizeâ€™s history. His 1952 success led to protests by art students, who brought a dachshund to the Gallery wearing the placard: â€˜Winner Archibald Prize â€“ William Doggieâ€™. Dargieâ€™s staunchly realist portraits often lacked the freshness and vitality seen in this portrait, which was painted in Sydney during a visit by Namatjira to the city.",

Born in Shanghai to Russian Jewish parents, Sages studied commercial art in Sydney and New York before embarking on a career in fashion illustration. Becoming a full-time artist in her fifties, Sages met and painted Anmatyerre artist Emily Kngwarreye during one of Sagesâ€™ many expeditions to Central Australia; her landscape, The road to Utopia, won the 2005 Wynne Prize. Her Archibald sitters have included dancer Meryl Tankard, author Helen Garner and Dutch-born filmmaker Paul Cox, shown in this portrait, whose body of idiosyncratic films Sages greatly admired.\\n\\nLauded as the father of Australian independent cinema, Cox wrote and directed the critically acclaimed documentary Vincent in 1987. Here, Sages casts the director in his home, pipe in hand. Behind him, an image of Van Goghâ€™s Self-portrait with bandaged ear and pipe 1889 offers insight into Coxâ€™s state of mind. The 56-year-old filmmaker was about to leave for America, unable to source funding in Australia for his next project. Silhouetted against a bright sunlit window, the contours of Coxâ€™s face and troubled countenance are sensitively conveyed. Painted over a four-month period, Sages recalled, â€˜It was a terribly moving experience for meâ€™.\\n\\nPaul Cox died in 2016, aged 76.",

She won the 1989 Portia Geach Memorial Award with a portrait of printmaker Alex Karpin, whom she had also painted for the Archibald (1989, 1990), exhibiting under the pseudonym Jenny Sands.

In the 1940s his skills as a buckjumper at country shows and boxer in Rockhampton boxing stadium were celebrated, and he was known for being an excellent accordion player. He was also a successful tracker, whose expertise in solving missing person cases led to two transfers to Victoria Police in the 1930s and late 1950s. A highly developed knowledge and skill refined by Aboriginal people, the ability to track or â€˜readâ€™ the landscape led to the establishment of Victoria Policeâ€™s own corps of Queensland Aboriginal trackers in the 1880s. \\n\\nBustard was an exceptional draughtsman, who studied at Londonâ€™s Slade School. His urban and rural landscape painting brought him wide recognition and influence.

His interest in drama led him to stage design, with his portraits possessing a theatrical quality. From 1950, Peir travelled extensively in Central Australia, the Northern Territory and Flinders Ranges in South Australia. He painted First Nations people and desert landscapes, and his work featured in the 1982 exhibition Art sale for land rights.\\n\\nThis portrait was painted at the artistâ€™s family home in Oatley, where Noonuccal stayed on her visits to Sydney. Peirâ€™s realism verges on surrealism; the poetâ€™s elongated figure against a vast, green-tinged vista is reminiscent of the dreamlike figure-landscapes of Russell Drysdale.",

There was a deputation from all over Australia of Aboriginal spokesmen and women and we did go in. Sir Robert Menzies had told the public and the politicians, the people of the House, that he would not have a referendum in his lifetime as prime minister. Heâ€™d been badly beaten on the referendum before where he had appealed to the people to outlaw Communism and when the people said â€˜No outlawing of the Communist Partyâ€™, Sir Robert Menzies refused then to have anything to do with referendums in his lifetime as prime minister.\\n\\nWe lobbied the House of Parliament and itâ€™s to their discredit, really, that when we asked them to bring out the laws concerning the Aboriginal people that there was no laws, no books on the Aboriginal people in their archives or libraries, and they had to quickly have them printed, so that the politicians could read what it was, for and against the Aborigines. There was one, however, on the national â€“ the Canberra law book saying that if Aboriginals go into Canberra, any Justice of the Peace could declare them illegal immigrants into Canberra and they could be chased out of Canberra. This still applied to us, incidentally, at this period of time. And we always made a joke of it when we went to Canberra, you know, â€˜If you get into trouble, you know the law on the book. If a JP says Get Out, make sure you get your blanket,â€™ because the law still said that before sending them out of Canberra, they must first issue them with one government blanket. So we were determined weâ€™d get our government blanket if ever they threw us out.  \\nWe told everyone this and we made it a laughingstock â€“ Canberra a laughingstock â€“ to such an extent that the first thing Sir Robert Menzies did was delete that off the Canberra constitution. So itâ€™s no longer there.",

                    "transcript": "I would say that the majority of the Australian people voted Yes in favour of the Aboriginal people merely to clear their guilty conscience. Itâ€™s easy to put a mark on a ballot paper, and I must say this definitely, that there was a small minority group of sincere Australian people but I would say 75 [per cent] of those who voted Yes did it to clear their guilty conscience.\\n\\nIncidentally, itâ€™s interesting to understand why those terrible discriminative laws were put into the books. In the first place, our civic fathers, or the white manâ€™s civic fathers of long ago, during the â€˜soothing of the dying pillowâ€™ era, the politicians, or the statesmen of that time, were writing over to Queen Victoria saying, â€˜The Aborigine is dying out.â€™ And true, he was â€“ they were poisoning him with strychnine in the waterholes and they were shooting him, and they were doing all sorts of things. And the Aborigine dropped from 300,000 strong to 80,000 in a very short period of time. So it was quite natural for them to say the Aborigine was a dying race.\\n\\nNow it was during this period of time that the Constitution was being fixed, and as they thought we were a dying race, to save themselves a lot of bother they said, â€˜Well we will not count the Aborigines and we do not have to make laws for the Aborigines, because theyâ€™re going to die out anywayâ€™. And this is the reason today why Aboriginals have not had any education, any decent housing, any facilities that the white Australian enjoys today. Itâ€™s because of that stupid business of thinking the Aboriginals were going to die out.\\n\\nMind you, the Aboriginals are a determined lot, and theyâ€™re quite ungrateful. They didnâ€™t die, they lived on and are still living on; in spite of the many attempts to commit genocide and assassinate us all, we are still here. I think weâ€™ll last the white man out, truly.",

It is not known when she was born (probably between 1884 and 1891) but she emigrated to Australia from Guangdong, China as a child. In this portrait, her weathered skin and arresting presence embody her abiding resilience; she survived two world wars, the deaths of her husband and only daughter, and the destruction of her gardens by Cyclone Tracy in 1974.\\n\\nGeoff La Gerche was dubbed an â€˜eyeball realistâ€™ for his super-scaled portraits, which were a commanding feature of the Archibald Prize in the late 1970s. Following formal studies in Melbourne, La Gerche departed for London in 1967. At the Royal College of Art, his teacher, American pop artist Jim Dine, had a profound effect on his work. Returning to Australia, La Gerche utilised air-brushed acrylics to achieve precise renderings of light and shade in his early hyper-real works. In 1979, La Gerche took up an artist residency in Darwin. There, he produced a series of vast landscapes painted with finely textured brushwork in oil â€“ and this striking portrait of a beloved Northern Territory identity. \\n\\nThis was one of La Gercheâ€™s two works in the 1979 Archibald â€“ the second a portrait of YolÅ‹u elder Wesley Lanhupuy. He was also a finalist in the 1979 Wynne Prize for landscape painting and Sulman Prize for genre painting.",

Following military service in Palestine and New Guinea during World War II, Fullbrook trained alongside Fred Williams and John Brack at Melbourneâ€™s National Gallery School under William Dargie. He then spent the 1950s and 1960s travelling and painting across Australia, working as a miner, cane cutter and stockman. Keenly interested in horses, Fullbrook was living in Brisbane in the 1970s when he became a racehorse owner and met veteran jockey Norman Stephens (1931â€“2019).\\n\\nStephens, then 43 years old, had a successful career riding before turning his hand to training. His bantam weight and legendary status earned him the nickname â€˜Whopperâ€™. Of his selection, Fullbrook said: â€˜Why on earth shouldnâ€™t we have footballers and tram conductors, and so on, as worthy subjects?â€™ It was a popular winner.\\n\\nFullbrookâ€™s portrait is painted in his deceptively naÃ¯ve style with strong blocks of colour and his spontaneous alla prima (â€˜wet on wetâ€™) technique. Critic Nancy Borlase noted: \\n\\nâ€˜Fullbrook â€¦ vividly catches the character of this pert, flyweight figure with his scarlet cap and sash and lightly held whip â€¦ painted with a touch as light and as swift as a jockey in motion.â€™",

Campbell and Silva were both born in Kempsey, growing up on Burnt Bridge Mission, where speaking Aboriginal languages was forbidden, and children were still forcibly removed from their families.\\n\\nTaught by his father, Campbell made souvenirs from found materials, incorporating his knowledge of the plants, animals and environment on Dunghutti/Ngaku Country. He eventually turned to canvas and painted narrative works, recording stories remembered from his childhood. Campbellâ€™s cartoon-style approach, using bold colours, often belies his weighty subjects: racial discrimination and the historical trauma of colonialism.\\n\\nBoth Campbell and Silva were living in Sydney in the 1980s. Campbell was undertaking a printmaking residency at Tin Sheds Gallery, and Silvaâ€™s rendition of â€˜Malabar mansionâ€™ â€“ written by an inmate while in Long Bay jail â€“ was the most requested song on Radio Redfern. Campbell portrays the 42-year-old Silva at his drums, mid song, titles from rockâ€™nâ€™roll and country hits drifting behind him. Tragically, Silva passed away before the portraitâ€™s selection in the Archibald; Campbell died just three years later.",

Today is the one day each year artists eclipse sportsmen in the news!â€™\\n\\nMeeting through mutual acquaintances, Hearman found Humphries a complex person to paint, declaring â€˜heâ€™s all things at onceâ€™. With the work developing in its own way over a period of three years, she sought to capture her sitterâ€™s â€˜truly fugitive faceâ€™. Hearman evokes an unexpected and vulnerable side to the man behind his outrageous and irreverent creations. With an air of melancholy and quietude, the portrait similarly portrays the impermanence and unrelenting nature of celebrity yet captures the resilient spirit of its then 82-year-old sitter. \\n\\nIn 2016 â€“ for the first time â€“ the Archibald Prize, Wynne Prize for landscape painting and Sulman Prize for genre painting were all awarded to women.",

From his early beginnings in vaudeville, Wallace went on to become Australiaâ€™s first genuine box-office star of â€˜the talkiesâ€™ (sound film). A versatile entertainer, Wallace performed on stage, in film and pantomime, composed songs, taught himself to play the piano, saxophone and guitar, and had his own radio show.\\n\\nThe artist and sitter met through a neighbour while Wallace was living with family on Sydneyâ€™s northern beaches, where Murch began preparatory sketches. Apparently, Wallace had argued with his relatives and subsequently moved to a flat in Darlinghurst. Murch was obliged to travel from his home in Avalon to Darlinghurst each day, with Wallace too anxious to leave his own home because of ill health. Ria Murch noted Wallaceâ€™s larrikin presence in the portrait, but her husbandâ€™s interest in classical nuances and the rich and shimmering tones are a clever metaphor. She said, â€˜Put a red biretta on him and Murchâ€™s Wallace could pass for a Renaissance cardinalâ€™.\\n\\nMurch was committed to portraying the unique character of the people he encountered, from academics and religious figures to artists he met throughout his career. He won the 1949 Archibald with a portrait of fellow artist Bonar Dunlop.",

It was, however, Barrie Koskyâ€™s 1998 production of King Lear, starring Bell, that profoundly impacted the artist. Harding noted, â€˜I sat in the front row â€¦ It was very dramatic and exciting, and Johnâ€™s performance was riveting.â€™ Harding used stage lighting to highlight Bellâ€™s figure and create sharp contrasts in his appearance, stating: \\n\\nâ€˜To have him in character â€¦ allowed me to capture a more intense expression on his face. The wonderful red coat he wore as Lear has also worked well for the portrait.â€™\\n\\nThis was the second time Harding selected Bell as his subject, with the first in 2000. \\n\\nOver 26 years, Harding twice portrayed artist Margaret Olley (1998, 1999); Margaret Whitlam (2003, 2009), social campaigner and wife of former prime minister Gough Whitlam; and Gija artist Rusty Peters (2002, 2004).

Many critics of the time saw it as caricature, but he made a deep impression on me because his shrewd pictorial observations had an affinity with my own theatrical portrayals of Melbourne life.â€™\\n\\nBrack and Humphries became friends in the late 1950s. Through their own artforms, both artists presented satirical insights into Menzies Governmentâ€“era conservatism and suburban aspirations. Humphries approached Brack about the portrait in 1968, when his fictitious character, Mrs Edna Everage, had evolved from the shy â€˜averageâ€™ housewife to the flamboyant and garrulous media personality recognised today, but before she took the title â€˜Dameâ€™. Ednaâ€™s choice of attire â€“ a uranium-green dress with contrasting hot-pink Thai silk coat â€“ was favoured by fashion-conscious housewives of the time. The Australian commented that the subject â€˜shrieks with cerise and greenâ€™.\\n\\nBrackâ€™s portrayal of Humphriesâ€™ most famous persona is painted in his distinctive deadpan manner, with precise arrangements of smooth flat colour. It was the first of seven portraits of Humphries â€“ in all his guises â€“ seen in the Archibald.",

A renowned concert pianist, Helfgott has struggled with schizoaffective disorder for much of his adult life. At age 19, he studied at Londonâ€™s Royal College of Music, but returned to Australia when his health deteriorated. In the 1980s, as Helfgott remembered, â€˜The fog lifted, I could hear again â€¦ I survivedâ€™. He returned to the concert stage and in 2021 was awarded an Order of Australia Medal.\\n\\nHoodâ€™s portrayal, while suggesting her subjectâ€™s fragile mental state, is also a celebration of the triumph of the human spirit. Hood recalled: â€˜His extraordinary music merges with his powerful magical persona to give his audience a most moving and lingering giftâ€™.\\n\\nHood has used watercolour on canvas, and the gentle trickle of the watery medium down her subjectâ€™s features creates an ethereal effect, like flowing translucent tears. She was inspired by Helfgottâ€™s resilience, affirming, â€˜So much of his emotion is represented in his wonderful face. Even so, I know that this painting can only express a moment and a fragment of itâ€™.\\n\\nSeven years earlier, Hood had become the sixth woman to win the Archibald, taking out the 2002 prize with a portrait of another pianist, Simon Tedeschi.",

With her husband and professional partner Harry Seidler (1923â€“2006), she conceived the iconic Harry & Penelope Seidler House, in the Sydney suburb of Killara, whose design is finely attuned to the Australian climate and focused on a connection to the outdoors. It is within the bush landscape adjacent to the house that Lowry positions Seidler, in this portrait painted eight years after her husbandâ€™s death.\\n\\nImbued with a wistful and dream-like quality, Seidlerâ€™s otherworldly figure stares out of the canvas from her leafy surrounds. Her gaze, however, suggests inward reflection. Memory, place and history are evoked through the soft pastel tones applied with Lowryâ€™s distinctive airbrush technique. Seidler maintains a quiet, sombre demeanour that, while seemingly fragile, draws strength from, as Lowry explained, â€˜history and memories of life very well livedâ€™.\\n\\nSeidler joins three other prominent architects whose portraits took out the Archibald Prize: Harold Desbrowe Annear (1921, displayed in Archie 100), Sir John Sulman (1931) and Neville Gruzman (1970).",

Mannix was staunchly anti-conscription, pro-Irish-republicanism and supported trade unionism, bringing him into direct conflict with Australiaâ€™s Protestant majority. He was an Archibald subject on six occasions, including portrayals by John Longstaff (1935), Clifton Pugh (1962), and this work by little-known artist James Patrick â€˜Maxâ€™ Martin, painted a decade before Mannixâ€™s death, aged 99.\\n\\nMartin studied briefly in Melbourne before travelling to England in 1913 where he achieved remarkable success at Londonâ€™s Royal Academy and the Paris Salon in the 1920s, then disappeared from the spotlight, becoming a music hall entertainer and scenery painter. Martin returned to Australia in 1948. \\n\\nIt is little wonder that Martin, with his Galway heritage, chose to portray Mannix. In his distinctive highly ordered style, with cool clear tones and the figure carefully contained in outline, using the form of a Gothic window, Martin positions Mannix at the heart of his city and his community. Appositely, the reverse of this two-sided work depicts the flagellation of Christ at the hands of the Romans.",

She became Australiaâ€™s leading feminist â€“ a crusader for family planning, equal pay and employment for women â€“ and deeply committed to social justice and peace. Street was the only female adviser in the Australian delegation to the founding conference of the United Nations in 1945 and established the UN Commission on the Status of Women and the Charter of Womenâ€™s Rights.\\n\\nFollowing studies at Londonâ€™s Royal Academy under John Singer Sargent and Sir William Orpen, Reginald Jerrold-Nathan was an established portrait painter when he arrived in Sydney in 1924. Having painted members of the royal families of England, Denmark and Iraq, he was well-received in Sydney society. One of the prizeâ€™s most prolific artists, Jerrold-Nathan portrayed many of Australiaâ€™s leading women, including authors Dorothea Mackellar (1930) and Ethel Turner (Mrs Curlewis 1933), and feminist Linda Littlejohn (another of his four 1929 Archibald entries).\\n\\nJerrold-Nathanâ€™s penchant for painting finery can be seen in Streetâ€™s stylish velvet brocade jacket and gleaming green-beaded necklace.

After all, the trade union movement is supposed to represent both the men and the women in jobs. There must be amongst their membership, the same number of intelligent women as there are intelligent men. And I would very much hope to see in the future â€“ I donâ€™t suppose itâ€™ll come in my lifetime â€“ that they have the proper distribution of places of influence between men and women both in the governing bodies of unions, and also, later on, when things gets more socialistic, in the governing body of the industries themselves.\\n\\nNow I say, â€˜get more socialisticâ€™, there because many years ago I became a socialist. I read quite a lot of books about politics and so on and so forth, and it seemed to me to be the system under which the individual, whether a man or a woman, had the greatest opportunity of developing their usefulness and status. You only have to look back in history in the days of serfdom and all the rest of it. Itâ€™s as theyâ€™ve gradually overcome the limitations that were placed on them by the social system, that not only women have advanced but society itself has advanced. And of course, if you come to think of it, men and women are both components of society and if you have a horse with a lame foot or a shackled foot itâ€™s not going to gallop was well as one that hasnâ€™t got, who hasnâ€™t got any shackles on. And itâ€™s the same with the human race â€“ if youâ€™re going to shackle the women, as they have been in the past and to a certain extent still are, youâ€™re going to hold up the progress of the whole of our society.",

He took the 1971 prize with a portrait of former prime minister Sir John McEwen and the 1965 prize with that of newspaperman RA Henderson. By the time of the 1972 Archibald announcement in January 1973, Labor leader Gough Whitlam (1916â€“2014) was Australiaâ€™s 21st prime minister. The win drew enormous crowds to the recently refurbished Art Gallery of New South Wales and the painting was Whitlamâ€™s choice for his official portrait at Parliament House. Whitlam wrote to the artist: â€˜My place in the history of art and yours in the history of politics are now secureâ€™.\\n\\nWhitlam â€“ like his portrait â€“ was either revered or derided, according to political predilection. He introduced many controversial policy measures and social reforms that radically changed Australiaâ€™s economic, legal and cultural landscape: establishing the Australia Council for the Arts, eliminating university fees, abolishing the death penalty, and ending military conscription. His troubled administration, however, was cut short when he was dismissed by the governor-general in 1975. \\n\\nTrained at Melbourneâ€™s National Gallery School, Pugh was best known for his bush landscapes, but became a sought-after portraitist. He made multiple versions of Whitlamâ€™s portrait, trying to capture the dynamic Labor leader and cement his place in Archibald legend.",

She had an unsettled childhood, with her family enduring financial hardship, but matriculated from South Melbourne College. With the cost of university prohibitive and needing to earn a living, she became a governess and journalist. Prichard championed the underdog and the oppressed and, following the death of her brother during World War I, she campaigned against conscription and war. She became a foundation member of the Australian Communist Party and was later vilified by conservative politicians for her loyalty to the Russian people. From the 1940s, her popular novels followed the aesthetic conventions of socialist realism.\\n\\nIt is little wonder Prichard became one of Noel Counihanâ€™s Archibald subjects. He had painted several prominent trade union leaders and those in academic and literary circles. As a young man during the Depression, Counihan joined the Communist Party. Rejecting the academic tonal approach of classes at Melbourneâ€™s National Gallery School, he left, preferring to work alongside politically motivated artists, including Roy Dalgarno and Yosl Bergner. Throughout his life, his art reflected his concern with social injustice and the human condition.\\n\\nCounihan painted this portrait of Prichard in three days, aiming to capture her humanity, dignity and resilience.",

He is primarily known for his elegiac expressionist landscapes, depicting his beloved Tasmania. His training at Hobartâ€™s Tasmanian School of Art under the influential Jack Carington Smith â€“ who was the first Tasmanian artist to win the Archibald in 1963 â€“ was strengthened through close study of the Romantic landscapes of English artists John Constable and JMW Turner.\\n\\nIn Dyerâ€™s 1993 Archibald work, landscape and portrait coalesce as Brown gazes defiantly out from the canvas, arms crossed, sleeves rolled up, framed by the majestic scenery of the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park â€“ now part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.\\n\\nDyer won the 2003 Archibald â€“ the second artist from the â€˜Apple Isleâ€™ to claim the award â€“ with his depiction of another Tasmanian, author Richard Flanagan.",

It shows him in the Sydney backyard of his neighbour, artist Josonia Palaitis, in a manner that is surprisingly relaxed and starkly different to his usually formal and conservative image. A lawyer by profession, Howard became leader of the Liberal Party in 1995 and the 25th prime minister of Australia the following year, defeating Laborâ€™s Paul Keating, whose portrait hangs nearby. Howardâ€™s often contentious 12-year tenure is the second longest in history after Sir Robert Menzies, whose portrait by Ivor Hele won the 1954 Archibald.\\n\\nA graduate of the National Art School and City Art Institute (now UNSW Art & Design), Palaitis is known for her photorealist approach to portraiture, working from informal photographs of her subjects. Creating drawings and watercolour studies, she shares these with her sitters before moving on to the final canvas. Her other Archibald subjects include jazz musician James Morrison (1993) and Justice Michael Kirby of the Australian High Court (2006).\\n\\nTwo decades after this portrait, Palaitis was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery to paint then prime minister John Howard with his wife Janette, this time in the gardens of Kirribilli House in Sydney.",

Largely self-taught, he won the Archibald twice: in 1989 with a portrait of artist Elwyn Lynn, and with this painting of Paul Keating (born 1944). Keating had just seized the Labor Party leadership from Bob Hawke â€“ the first time an incumbent prime minister was removed from office by his party. Keating himself lost power in a landslide 1996 federal election defeat, to Liberal leader John Howard (whose portrait hangs nearby).\\n\\nKeating is known for his way with words. His best-known utterance may be his description of the countryâ€™s 1990 economic slump as â€˜the recession we had to haveâ€™, although his â€˜Redfern speechâ€™, recognising the impact of colonial and government policies on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, was truly groundbreaking.\\n\\nWestwoodâ€™s cool, painstaking portrayal of Keating, meticulously attired in one of his favoured Italian suits, was painted over five sittings in the artistâ€™s precise realist style. Keating said of Westwood, whom heâ€™d known since 1987: \\n\\nâ€˜A measure of his standing was that he was a painter in the classical tradition, but whose work was relevant in the ambience of contemporary Australian art. He made it easier for other artists to develop that vernacular.â€™",

This was the eighth and last time one of these entries was selected. \\n\\nIn this portrait, Hughes is accompanied by two of his heroes, Ambroise Vollard and Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler, art dealers for Paul CÃ©zanne and Pablo Picasso, who were part of a seminal shift in art history â€“ the beginnings of modernism. Smith said: \\n\\nâ€˜I think Ray too is always trying to change things, to reinvent himself and look for the new in art. I think heâ€™d really have liked to have lived in that era.â€™\\n\\nA key figure within the art community for more than 45 years, Hughes is credited as instrumental in introducing contemporary Chinese art to Australian audiences, as well as promoting art from Africa, Papua New Guinea and Aotearoa New Zealand. He was, likewise, passionately committed to the work of the many Australian artists he represented. Appearing in the Archibald on 14 occasions â€“ including portraits by Lewis Miller (1990), Lucy Culliton (2011) and Jun Chen (2005, 2017) â€“ Hughes once commented: \\n\\nâ€˜Being an art dealer is not about selling things. Itâ€™s about somehow acquiring a bunch of things that are worth considering. Why can this stuff keep you involved for 40 years? Because it means something.â€™",

The subject of this portrait is influential art dealer and patron Georges Mora (1913â€“92), whom Williams married in 1985. \\n\\nIn this portrait, Williams has shrewdly referenced James Abbott McNeill Whistlerâ€™s famous 1871 portrait of his mother, Arrangement in grey and black no 1. Although similar in some ways â€“ the pose, pared back composition and neutral colour scheme â€“ we can sense both the artistâ€™s and sitterâ€™s playful and satirical humour beneath the formal stylisation. Moraâ€™s knowing and mischievous gaze, slight smile and smart suit with pink tie allude to his renowned European style and charm. \\n\\nMora fled Nazi Germany for Paris in the early 1930s and became involved with the French Resistance. He emigrated to Australia with his first wife Mirka (the couple separated in 1970 and later divorced), arriving in Melbourne in 1951. Mora established himself as an art dealer and restaurateur and became a leading figure on the national art scene, founding Tolarno Galleries in 1967. The year of this portrait, Mora helped organise the Australian Contemporary Art Fair and was appointed chevalier de lâ€™Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.\\n\\nIn 2006, Williams created the Georges Mora Foundation and Fellowship, which provides support and promotion of contemporary art and artists in Australia.",

Warren trained briefly under JS Watkins in his Sydney studio. He began drawing seriously during service in Bougainville in World War II and subsequently studied at Sydney Technical College (now the National Art School) under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Training Scheme. Further study in London followed.\\n\\nIn 1985, Viennese-born sculptor Bert Flugelman (1923â€“2013) â€“ Warrenâ€™s friend, neighbour and colleague at the University of Sydneyâ€™s Tin Sheds Art Workshop â€“ challenged him to enter the Archibald, with each artist painting a portrait of the other. Flugelmanâ€™s portrait wasnâ€™t accepted that year, but he did have six works in the Archibald between 1950 and 1965. Flugelman is celebrated for his monumental stainless-steel public sculptures, including Sydneyâ€™s Pyramid Tower and the 20-metre-long Cones at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra.\\n\\nFlugelman with Wingman was then-64-year-old Warrenâ€™s first Archibald entry, and the win allowed him to paint full time. The motif of a â€˜wingmanâ€™ was inspired by hang-gliders he observed in the country, and the myth of Icarus who flew too close to the sun, melting his feather-and-wax wings. Warren explained, â€˜Itâ€™s about taking risks, taking chances, and escapingâ€™. \\n\\nIn the competitionâ€™s centenary year, a portrait of 100-year-old Warren by Peter Wegner was awarded the 2021 Archibald Prize.",

There she was introduced to the work of French Nabis artists Ã‰douard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard by her teacher Wallace Thornton (himself a ten-time Archibald exhibitor), with their focus on light and striking use of colour. Winning the 1958 NSW Travelling Art Scholarship, she based herself in Florence until 1964, attending the AcadÃ©mie de la Grande ChaumiÃ¨re in Paris and the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, and studying briefly under Austrian expressionist artist Oskar Kokoschka.\\n\\nReturning permanently to Sydney in 1968, she eventually joined a growing community of artists at Wedderburn. Over the following five decades, Cummingsâ€™ intuitive works have traversed the genres of still life, landscape and portraiture. The pulsating movement of light and mood permeate the surfaces of her canvases, with intersecting planes of loosely brushed areas of colour.\\n\\nPainted when she was 63 and her sitter 80, here Cummings portrays her friend, artist Jean Appleton (1911â€“2003), winner of the inaugural Portia Geach Memorial Award in 1965. Concerned purely with the space and colour of the living room where Appleton is seated, Cummings stated: â€˜This is my interpretation, my feeling about Jean Appleton â€¦ this room is very much Jean, her presence is everywhere.â€™",

Abdullahâ€™s projects often address his concerns for marginalised minority groups, drawing on his own experiences as a young Muslim growing up in Australia in a post-9/11 world. In 2011 he won the Blake Prize for Human Justice.\\n\\nAbdullahâ€™s subject for his 2014 Archibald portrait is high-profile Kamilaroi, Kooma, Jiman and Gurang Gurang artist and political activist Richard Bell, who has appeared as a sitter eight times, including with self-portraits in 2004 and 2015. Born in Charleville, Queensland in 1953, the self-taught Bell has been exhibiting art for more than 25 years nationally and internationally, addressing issues of First Nations social justice, land rights and sovereignty.\\n\\nAbdullah saw Bell, his friend and mentor, as â€˜mountainous â€¦ the type of person who fills a room when he enters itâ€™. His visualisation of Bell as an astronaut, critically gazing back upon â€˜a planet gone madâ€™, references the 1968 sci-fi classic Planet of the apes, with the fictitious ANSA space agency logo on Bellâ€™s suit. Abdullah often interlaces icons of popular culture into his work, cyphers to be decoded by his audience through a measured process of revelation.",

Awarded the English-Speaking Union Travelling Scholarship in 1966, Binder followed the â€˜hippy trailâ€™ through Kashmir to London, where Australian artists Peter Upward (1932â€“83) and David Boyd (1924â€“2011) had settled. He held his first solo show in 1968 at the Clytie Jessop Gallery, London.\\n\\nBack in Sydney in 1969, Binder began teaching at NAS, eventually joined by Upward, a key figure of Australian gestural abstraction, and Roderick Shaw (1915â€“92), one of the founders of the Studio of Realist Art. Binder instilled in his students the essential role that drawing plays in the visual arts, and his large-scale highly finished works of the 1970s share an affinity with the detailed, photorealist works of Josonia Palaitis (who also has a work on display in Archie 100).\\n\\nOn 12 November 1975, the day after the Labor government of Gough Whitlam was controversially dismissed, Binder, Upward and Shaw formed the Artists Action Group, staging exhibitions to raise money for progressive causes. In this group portrait, Binder presents his comrades in art â€“ Boyd, Upward and Shaw â€“ deep in conversation, at ease in each otherâ€™s presence, with Boydâ€™s sfumato drawing and ceramic goblets completing the scene. Binder shrewdly aligned modern-day subjects with classical techniques, offering portraiture a new relevance in 1970s Australian art.",

Completing graduate and post-graduate degrees in Melbourne in the late 1980s, she then spent eight years in France, studying, working and painting.\\n\\nA traditional easel painter, Ross finds inspiration in vintage photography and images in old journals, books and postcards. Historical portraiture also informs her work, and her double portrait of gender-bending performance artists Garrett and Will Huxley is suggestive of the marriage portraits of Jan van Eyck and Piero della Francesca, and the fresco found in Pompeii of Terentius Neo and his wife. Elemental forms and the subtle dichotomy between abstraction and representation within her compositions reflect Rossâ€™s persistent dialogue with art across the ages.\\n\\nRoss wrote: \\n\\nâ€˜I saw the mysterious potential for art/civilisation to be expressed within the handsome duoâ€™s magical physical presence. This portrait is a homage to the pure folie of the Huxleysâ€™ performances, as well as hairstyles found in the portraits of Otto Dix and Diego VelÃ¡zquez. I wanted a deliberately distant, expressionless pose that transforms their glittery bodysuits and cheap, teased wigs into a portrait evoking the timeless silhouettes of antiquity and â€™old paintingsâ€™ I so admire.â€™",

One of his most recognisable designs was an early Chiko Roll poster, once found in fast-food shops across Australia. For his 1983 Archibald portrait â€“ painted in his signature realist manner â€“ Walters selected one of the most influential personalities in the music industry. Ian â€˜Mollyâ€™ Meldrum (born 1943), a record producer and music journalist, co-created and presented ABCâ€™s iconic Countdown. One of the first music television programs to incorporate music videos, the hugely popular show also afforded Meldrum an international reputation.\\n\\nIn Walterâ€™s portrait, Meldrum is caught mid-sentence â€“ perhaps about to extoll the latest â€˜Top 10â€™ hit â€“ wearing his trademark Stetson hat and boots and framed against a mural of a desert landscape in his Egyptian-themed home. In a Countdown episode filmed later in 1983 in his living room, Meldrum presents a segment seated in the same pose before the same mural. Meldrum believed that Walters should have received an award for forcing him to sit still and remain silent during the painting process. Meldrum remarked, â€˜While I shut up, he did a lot of talking and he was really one of the most interesting people Iâ€™ve ever metâ€™. English rock star Elton John purchased the portrait and later gifted it to his friend Meldrum. \\n\\nWalters won the Archibald with his 1979 portrayal of broadcaster Phillip Adams, one of several Australian celebrities captured by the Archibald artist over an 18-year period.",

Actor and model Kate Fischer, who was then engaged to billionaire businessman James Packer, was his 1997 sitter and, the following year, he portrayed David Campese, the recently retired rugby union legend. \\n\\nBy 2001, the comedy duo Roy Slaven and HG Nelson â€“ played by John Doyle (born 1953) and Greig Pickhaver (born 1948) â€“ had reached cult status with their entertaining sports commentaries and hilarious banter televised on The dream, during Sydneyâ€™s 2000 Olympic Games. Newton enjoyed working with â€˜Roy and HGâ€™, noting that their natural chemistry and rapport was as seamless in real life as it was on television. The unofficial Olympic mascot of The dream â€“ Fatso the wombat â€“ even makes a cheeky cameo appearance on Doyleâ€™s t-shirt. \\n\\nThe portrait won the Peopleâ€™s Choice award and the Packing Room Prize, the first time a work had claimed both prizes. When told of the Peopleâ€™s Choice win, Pickhaver commented: \\n\\nâ€˜Who can fault the taste of the Sydney public? An artist at the top of his form making a couple of very ordinary blokes look good â€“ it must have been a struggle.â€™",

Coppersmith is known for her portraits in oil, and she uses herself as a subject on frequent occasions. Her Archibald sitters have included human rights advocate Gillian Triggs and media personality John Safran. Her first self-portrait was a finalist in 2016. \\n\\nCoppersmith trained at the Victorian College of the Arts. Her early explorations with photorealism were inspired by portraitist Mathew Lynn, an Archibald finalist 17 times between 1989 and 2021, and winner of the Peopleâ€™s Choice award and the Packing Room Prize. A series of stylistic changes soon followed, as her visual language encompassed experiments with cubism and abstraction. She often references artists whose work she esteems, with George Lambertâ€™s Self-portrait with gladioli 1922 â€“ also seen in this display â€“ invoked here, with her composed stance and matter-of-fact gaze declaring her self-assuredness. \\n\\nShe wrote: \\n\\nâ€˜His style was academic, yet he supported the avant-garde in Australia and painted portraits of his artistic contemporaries Thea Proctor and Hera Roberts â€“ both independent, self-possessed style-makers at a time of burgeoning female empowerment. In referencing George Lambertâ€™s style, itâ€™s like an outfit slipped on, creating a fixed image of an ever-changing self.â€™",

She had appeared in George Lambertâ€™s The white glove 1921 (not an Archibald work) â€“ a portrait that was admired by art connoisseurs; McInnes acknowledges the painting in this portraitâ€™s composition. However, Archibald commentators were in uproar about whether the Melbourne socialite was â€˜distinguishedâ€™, an attribute mentioned in the prizeâ€™s entry terms. Literary critic Alfred Stephens, writing from Perth, deemed the award conditions had not been met: â€˜A portrait of Tom, Dick or Mary Anne is less valuable to Australia than a portrait of a person who has given distinguished service to national lifeâ€™.\\n\\nThere was a similar reaction to McInnesâ€™ 1923 win for Portrait of a lady, depicting his wife, the artist Violet McInnes, and again in 1926 when he won with Silk and lace, a portrait of artist Esther Paterson (whose own portrait of her sister Betty Paterson is displayed in Archie 100).",

Such modernist portraits were antithetical to the traditional work of WB McInnes, Charles Wheeler and John Longstaff, all respected â€“ and winning â€“ Archibald artists in the 1930s. \\n\\nCrowleyâ€™s decision to become a professional artist was extraordinary for her time. Against her parentsâ€™ wishes, she moved from rural New South Wales to Sydney and established a successful career as an artist and educator. Studying with Julian Ashton from 1915, then becoming his assistant and a teacher at his school, she left for France in 1926 with fellow instructor Anne Dangar. In Paris she absorbed the theories of cubism at AndrÃ© Lhoteâ€™s academy, then under Albert Gleizes, who influenced her development towards complete abstraction in the 1940s. Returning to Australia, Crowley joined artist Dorrit Black â€“ with whom she had painted in Europe â€“ in Sydney at her newly established Modern Art Centre. In 1932 Crowley established the Crowleyâ€“Fizelle School with painter Rah Fizelle. Crowley, Black and Fizelle were all Archibald artists between 1930 and 1933.\\n\\nCrowleyâ€™s 1933 Archibald work shows the artistâ€™s pure assimilation of Gleizesâ€™ teachings, and is one of her most abstracted portraits, with foreground and figure converging through the fragmented and faceted planes of grey green. \\n\\nRecent research has uncovered the subject of this work: Marjorie Roberts, a professional artistâ€²s model, who also sat for Dorrit Black and Arthur Murch in Sydney to support her family during the Depression.",

Shore studied at Melbourneâ€™s National Gallery School and briefly with tonalist Max Meldrum. However, he soon began painting works strongly influenced by post-impressionism, particularly Paul CÃ©zanne. In 1932, Shore opened a school with modernist artist George Bell. It was around that time that Shore met politician and judge Herbert â€˜Bertâ€™ Vere Evatt (1894â€“1965) and his wife Mary Alice Evatt (1898â€“1973), both spirited supporters of modern art. They provided Shore with his first commission: this CÃ©zannesque portrait of Bert, shown in the 1935 Archibald Prize.\\n\\nThe partnership between Shore and Bell didnâ€™t last. In 1937, while still producing post-impressionist-inspired works, Shore joined the conservative Australian Academy of Art. Vehemently opposing the Academy, Bell established the Contemporary Art Society in 1938, strongly supported by the Evatts.\\n\\nWhen William Dobell won the 1943 Archibald with his portrait of artist Joshua Smith â€“ with Mary Evatt, the first woman appointed a trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, voting in his favour â€“ the clash between the conservative and contemporary groups erupted. Like Shore, Dobell had exhibited with both groups (although neither artist represented the radicalism present in the two camps). It was only Dobell, however, who got caught in the crossfire.",

During World War I, he served in the Royal Flying Corps, flying sorties against the infamous Red Baron, and was awarded the Military Cross for bravery. In the 1930s, he flew with Charles Kingsford Smith on his record-breaking flights, and was a ferry pilot for military aircraft across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans during World War II. In 1951, he flew his Catalina flying boat, Frigate Bird II â€“ now in the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, Sydney â€“ on a pioneering route across the Pacific, from Sydney to ValparaÃ­so in Chile. Taylor was knighted in 1954 for services to aviation.\\n\\nNorman St Clair Carter was a renowned stained-glass artist and prolific portrait painter in the first half of the 20th century. Surprisingly, unlike others of his generation, Carter never travelled abroad. He trained under Frederick McCubbin, and later studied with E Phillips Fox. His portraits show a formal and precise quality, with his aim being to elucidate his subjectâ€™s character. Despite 58 portraits in the Archibald over 32 years, Carter never took out the prize. \\n\\nCarter portrays the aviator in his RFC leather flying coat, a striking figure set against calm blue skies, his Lockheed Altair on the dunes.",

Dr Vera, as she was known, was appointed director of the new Department of Infant Welfare in 1926, the first woman to head a government department in Victoria. She made far-reaching contributions in expanding and improving universal and free paediatric healthcare services across the state, the impacts of which can still be seen in healthcare centres today. Dr Vera received an OBE in 1938 in recognition of her distinguished work in preventative medicine. \\n\\nRuby Winifred Francis studied at Melbourneâ€™s National Gallery School, before marrying Hugh McCubbin, the son of artist Frederick McCubbin, in 1924. Affectionately known as Ruby Win, she resumed painting and exhibiting in the 1930s after a decade caring for her young family. Winifred McCubbin was an accomplished portraitist, and member â€“ later president â€“ of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters. She exhibited until the 1950s with artists such as Violet McInnes, Ethel Carrick, Sybil Craig and Ola Cohn.",

Doherty joined the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration following the cessation of hostilities in 1945, when she was appointed matron to the recently liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. She was awarded the Royal Red Cross for exceptional services in military nursing and her harrowing experiences were later published in Letters from Belsen 1945.\\n\\nDoherty, then 52 years, sat for this portrait every afternoon for a week, dressed in the Royal Australian Air Force Nursing Service uniform she had worn during the war.

Abbott was a keen observer of the many aspects that made up a soldierâ€™s everyday life, building a strong rapport with his subjects and learning about their experiences.\\n\\nThis portrait is one of the first Abbott produced as a war artist and demonstrates the trust he established with his subjects. Born in Victoria, Private Mark James Oâ€™Bryan (1917â€“2008) was a driver with the 2/2 Australian Infantry Battalion, 6th Australian Divisional Army Service Corps. He was recognised for exceptional services in the field in New Guinea, after he was shot in the face and left shoulder during a battle. \\n\\nIn October 1943, Oâ€™Bryan was transferred to the 115th (Heidelberg) Military Hospital in Victoria, where Abbott documented his horrific injuries. The soldier calmly meets the viewerâ€™s gaze, with Abbott honestly depicting his vulnerability while honouring his bravery.

Her success was overshadowed by the public focus on her being the daughter of celebrated painter Hans Heysen. It also drew the ire of Max Meldrum (the 1939 and 1940 Archibald winner), who told a journalist that the life of an artist was â€˜unnatural and impossible for a womanâ€™. \\n\\nIn 1943, Heysen broke more ground when she became the first woman in Australia to be appointed an official war artist. Serving mostly in New Guinea, she produced a large body of work, with the Australian War Memorial acquiring 152 of these under the Official War Art Scheme. New Guinea is also where Heysen met Dr Robert Black (1917â€“88), an eminent bacteriologist and professor of tropical medicine at the University of Sydney from 1963 to 1982.\\n\\nWhen this portrait was painted, Heysen was settling into life in Sydney with Black. He appears relaxed and in quiet contemplation, one hand resting across his blue pants; Heysen once claimed she never painted a picture â€˜without something blue in itâ€™. It is an intimate portrait, with the pictorial plane animated with loose, broken brushstrokes. A sense of immediacy and liveliness reflects Heysenâ€™s concern with the arrangement of and interaction between colour, light and form.",

With the rank of lieutenant, Watson covered military activities in Australia, New Guinea and Borneo. When he submitted this portrait, he had already become the youngest artist to win the Wynne Prize for landscape painting, in 1942.\\n\\nIn his 1943 Archibald portrait, Watson draws attention to a lesser-known role of wartime servicemen. Military couriers were used to deliver urgent messages between headquarters and combat units â€“ a vital and often perilous responsibility. Watson depicts rider Sergeant Rex Joseph Allan Beggs (1921â€“91), from Warrnambool, Victoria, a signalman with the 14 Australian Lines Section in Australia, Papua New Guinea and on the island of Biak, Indonesia. He is kitted out in his uniform: motorcycle helmet and goggles, leather gauntlets â€“ one of which is tightly clutching and protecting his valuable cargo â€“ and greatcoat with white and blue armbands. These armbands made despatchers easily distinguishable as part of the Signals unit. White symbolises the ribbons wound around the staff carried by the Greek god Hermes, the winged herald and messenger of the gods and protector of travellers, while blue represents the British royal colours.",

As part of the Australian Governmentâ€™s immigration scheme, he was contracted to work in a series of temporary jobs, including in a cement factory and as a railway porter and cleaner. In his artistic life, however, he found support and encouragement from influential Australian artists and critics such as James Gleeson, Paul Haefliger and Judy Cassab. He was prolific during the 1950s and 1960s, winning numerous awards including the 1953 Blake Prize for religious art and the 1957 and 1970 Sulman Prize for genre painting.\\n\\nA graduate of the Academy of Fine Arts in KrakÃ³w, Poland, Kmit was influenced by Byzantine icon painting, mosaic and folk art from his homeland in Ukraine, and the works of Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse. His distinctive portraits, with their emotive use of rich and luminous colour, patterning and geometric forms, were well received in Australia. Kmitâ€™s unique approach influenced many artists, particularly those in the artistsâ€™ colony at the Merioola mansion in Sydney, where he lived in 1950. \\n\\nThis was Kmitâ€™s first work selected for the Archibald; other Archibald portraits include two of artist Wallace Thornton (1955, 1969) and a portrayal of Dennis Colsey (1971), the first education officer appointed at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1967.",

It was only the second time since 1921 that a woman had won the Archibald, with both artist and sitter attracting the attention of the Australian public and media. Cassab was already a successful and sought-after portraitist, having won the inaugural Australian Womenâ€™s Weekly Portrait Prize in 1955. She was known for her ability to quickly capture her sitterâ€™s likeness inher distinctive style. Rapotec rose to greater prominence when he won the 1961 Blake Prize for religious painting, with the first abstract work awarded the prize.\\n\\nCassab (the child of Hungarian parents) and Rapotec (who was born in Trieste when it was part of Austro-Hungarian empire) connected through their shared experiences as â€˜New Australiansâ€™. During World War II, Rapotec had joined the Yugoslav Resistance, taking part in several courageous missions for the Allied Intelligence Forces. Cassab knew from a young age she would be an artist; however, her studies were interrupted by the Nazi occupation of Vienna. Arriving in Australia, Cassab found the acceptance of women as professional artists a difficult path to navigate. Nonetheless, she went on to win the Archibald Prize again in 1967, one of only two women to twice win the award (the other is Del Kathryn Barton, in 2008 and 2013).",

He had studied at the Royal Academy in Rome and later in Paris, exhibited successfully and taught at the Jewish Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. Feuerring was a soldier in World War I and in the war between Russia and Poland, and when World War II began he immediately joined the army. He was interned in several prisoner-of-war camps, including Murnau in Germany, where, upon his release, he met Gabriele MÃ¼nter of the Blue Rider Group.\\n\\nAfter the war, Feuerring found himself without home or family (most of them had died in concentration camps) and in 1950 he migrated to Australia, aged 54. The response to his work in his new country was negative or indifferent, which frustrated Feuerring, but he was sustained by his friendships with other Ã©migrÃ© artists â€“ including Judy Cassab and Louis Kahan (both eventually Archibald Prize winners). Feuerring also supported himself as a stage designer, restorer and teacher.\\n\\nThis self-portrait â€“ suggestive of French painter Pierre Bonnard, whose work Feuerring admired â€“ was his first Archibald entry. All 11 of Feuerringâ€™s Archibald works were self-portraits and demonstrate his highly individual and experimental approach to both style and technique.",

She was a close friend of four-time Archibald subject Jeffrey Smart; they studied together at the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts. With her lifelong commitment to the visual and performing arts, Hick was a founding member of the Contemporary Art Society, Adelaide Theatre Group and a board member of the Art Gallery of South Australia.\\n\\nHickâ€™s solid academic training was complemented by her desire to experiment with media, stylistic approaches and subject matter. Her keen observation and commitment to censure social injustices â€“ inspired by the social realism of Francisco Goya, HonorÃ© Daumier and KÃ¤the Kollwitz â€“ saw Hick tackle challenging subjects, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander dispossession and urban poverty.\\n\\nThis portrait of painter Francis Roy Thompson (1896â€“1966), with its rich and glowing cast of viridian green, portrays one of Adelaideâ€™s central figures of post-war modernism and a three-time Archibald artist. A member of Adelaideâ€™s Hexagon group with Hick, Thompson was born in Mansfield, Victoria and trained under WB McInnes and Bernard Hall in Melbourne before settling in Adelaide around 1950. There he developed a vigorous expressionist style in his images of suburban scenes.",

Following his studies at Melbourneâ€™s National Gallery School, he was awarded the 1899 National Gallery of Victoria Travelling Scholarship and returned to Europe, spending almost 12 years in France. Absorbing works by the likes of Diego VelÃ¡zquez and rejecting the post-impressionists and cubists, he cemented his dedication to realism, decrying modern art as a â€˜pathological symptom of the diseased condition of modern civilisationâ€™. Meldrum returned to Melbourne, established an art school, and wrote a â€˜manifestoâ€™ on his theories of tonalism, Max Meldrum: his art and views.\\n\\nWhen Nora Heysen â€“ at just 28 â€“ became the first woman to win the Archibald in 1938, Meldrumâ€™s controversial public stance pillorying her success was unyielding. The 63-year-old declared, â€˜If I were a woman, I would certainly prefer raising a healthy family to a career in artâ€™. He was contentiously appeased when the trustees awarded him both the 1939 and 1940 Archibald Prize.\\n\\nDespite his orthodox and polarising views, which fuelled the rancorous conflict between artists of the academic and contemporary camps in the late 1930s, Meldrumâ€™s skill with the brush is unequivocal. This semi-naked portrait of his 75-year-old self attracted frenzied attention, much to Meldrumâ€™s vainglorious delight.",

That win was challenged by a group of artists, led by Mary Edwell-Burke and Joseph Wolinski, who took Dobell and the Gallery to court, claiming the work was a distorted caricature, not a portrait. The experience was soul-destroying for both Dobell and Smith, despite the court ruling in Dobellâ€™s favour. The painting was all but destroyed in a fire in 1958.\\n\\nWhat is often overlooked is that Dobell exhibited two other portraits in that most controversial year in the prizeâ€™s history. One of them was The billy boy, painted at Rathmines RAAF Base during World War II, where Dobell worked with Smith as a camoufleur and artist for the Civil Constructional Corps. Dobell paints the siteâ€™s tea maker, Glaswegian Joe Westcott â€“ a heavily tattooed former marine â€“ using his distinctive technique, layering veils of oil glazes. Westcott was a local identity at Wangi on Lake Macquarie, north of Sydney, where Dobell escaped to his parentsâ€™ holiday cottage following the Archibald controversy. Wangi was the setting for the landscape painting that won Dobell the 1948 Wynne Prize, the same year he won the Archibald with his portrait of artist Margaret Olley, making him the first artist to claim both in the same year.",

The fact that his own portrait of acclaimed writer Mary Gilmore (1865â€“1962) was the runner-up that year is largely unknown. Also forgotten is Smithâ€™s 1944 win â€“ for a painting of politician John Solomon Rosevear â€“ which was seen by many as a consolation prize, as Dobell was, by then, a Gallery trustee and Archibald judge.\\n\\nDobell and Smithâ€™s friendship was irrevocably damaged by the court case involving the 1943 award that challenged the paintingâ€™s legitimacy as a portrait (many felt it was closer to caricature). Art critics, gallery directors, artists, even medical experts were called on for their opinion, and Smithâ€™s appearance was put under intense and humiliating scrutiny. Behind the scenes, Gilmore acted as Smithâ€™s champion. Ultimately, Smith believed the actions of the artists who instigated the court case â€“ Mary Edwell-Burke and Joseph Wolinski â€“ were impelled by their fear of the changes in art driven by modernism.\\n\\nAs an artist, Smith himself was dedicated to capturing the intrinsic personality of his sitters; his consummate skill as a draughtsman was honed through lessons with Adelaide Perry at Julian Ashtonâ€™s art school, following several years of study at East Sydney Technical College",

Their significant private collection, which Robert bequeathed to Mildura in 1944, included works by Sir William Orpen and Sir Frank Brangwyn. Further works were also bequeathed by Hilda in 1970. Hilda â€“ daughter of eminent politician and newspaper proprietor Theodore Fink â€“ was very active in her husbandâ€™s ambitions and endeavours, and the couple played an important role in Melbourneâ€™s cultural life. Hilda is depicted in what appears to be Allenâ€™s studio, her relaxed pose suggesting a close friendship between the two women.\\n\\nBy 1925, Allen was highly regarded as a painter, particularly of portraits, and as a lecturer on art. Robert had instigated and funded a series of lectures in the 1920s held at the National Gallery of Victoria, some of which Allen presented. Allenâ€™s early paintings, including this portrait, reveal a more conservative approach, reflecting the influence of her studies with Bernard Hall, and the tonalist teachings of Max Meldrum in the early 1920s. However, Allen soon became a strong advocate of modern art, eventually leaving Australia for America in 1927 to become a respected art educator.",

It really flatters meâ€™. Hele was already an acclaimed war artist and this, his first Archibald win, plus a subsequent four during the 1950s, ensured his reputation and success as a master draughtsman and painter of the human form. Taking only two days to complete, the portrait demonstrates Heleâ€™s remarkable abilities in observation and execution, and his skill at quickly and accurately rendering his sitterâ€™s appearance. \\n\\nAt this time, Thomas had returned to Melbourne from overseas and, after working as an art critic with The Herald, had taken up the role as assistant director to Daryl Lindsay at the National Gallery of Victoria. Thomas had also been researching for the Jubilee Exhibition of Australian Art to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Commonwealth of Australia, for which he travelled around the country to meet with artists. Perhaps on a research visit to South Australia is when Thomas would have posed for this portrait, as a work by Hele was included in the exhibition. Hele always required his portrait subjects to sit for him at his Aldinga studio.",

She found a remarkably conservative art scene in the city, compared to Europe. With a background in art history, Langer made it her mission to promote and support contemporary Australian art and artists as well as educate the wider Australian public on art.\\n\\nInitially conducting private introductory courses on art history and appreciation in her home, Langer went on to become â€˜Brisbaneâ€™s authority on artâ€™ as chief art critic for The Courier Mail from 1956 to 1984. Langerâ€™s discerning and encouraging voice did much to foster a fertile artistic atmosphere and community. After viewing Andrew Sibleyâ€™s first solo exhibition in 1960, she commented that the artist was â€˜a figurative expressionist painter [â€¦] concerned with the predicaments and anxieties of man in our worldâ€™.\\n\\nSibley is associated with the 1960s â€˜Brisbane Schoolâ€™, along with his friend Jon Molvig (who won the 1966 Archibald Prize and is also included in Archie 100). This portrait is typical of Sibleyâ€™s stylised and gestural works of that time, with paint applied with a palette knife or scraper to manipulate and layer the workâ€™s surface.",

Eric Smith was 62 years old at the time and had been exhibiting with Komon for over 20 years. \\n\\nThe win created controversary when it was revealed that the portrait resembled a photograph of Komon taken in 1974, allegedly breaching the Archibald Prizeâ€™s rule of entry that the portrait be painted from life. John Bloomfield, whose 1975 winning portrait of film director Tim Burstall had been disqualified when it was revealed it had been painted from a photograph, sued for the return of the award plus interest. There were distinct differences between the cases, however. Bloomfield had never met his subject and had painted the portrait directly from a magazine image. Smith did admit that he had seen and used a photograph but that he had used other sources as well, including multiple sittings with Komon, whom he knew very well and had painted frequently over the years. The Bloomfield case was subsequently dismissed and Smith retained his win.\\n\\nThe Gallery went on to acquire the painting with additional funds contributed by Komon.",

The elaborate gold frame has a double edge and is approximately 30cm wide with ornate textured, gold foliage decorating the corners and central sections of each side. \\n\\nGeorge is larger than life, from his upper thigh to the crown of his head, wearing a luxurious robe and assuming a flamboyant pose. Standing at ease, his back arched, with one hand on his hip and the other hand extended upwards in an affected gesture. \\n\\nGeorge stands in the centre of the composition, against a matt, deep purple background. His body is on an angle with his left upper arm obscured from view, and his face turned towards us. \\n\\nGeorgeâ€™s hairline is receding. His remaining hair is short and swept back behind his ears, revealing right ear. His hair is light brown, with blond and copper highlights. His pale, dome shaped forehead has a sheen across it. He has a slightly furrowed brow, between full eyebrows, drawn over hazel eyes hooded with heavy eyelids. He looks directly at us with a weary yet quizzical gaze. \\n\\nHis cheeks are flushed a rosy pink and his nose is long and straight with flared nostrils. He has a neat manicured moustache, the ends of which are waxed and turned upwards, extending just beyond the slightly upturned corners of his mouth. His pink, full lips are closed around a black pipe, which dangles from the left-hand side of his mouth. His well- groomed beard follows his jaw line, trimmed close to his cheeks and then from his chin it is longer, thicker and shaped to a blunt point.\\n\\nHe wears a sumptuous old gold velvet smoking jacket with wide, dark taupe corduroy lapels and cuffs, with deep pockets on either side in the front.\\n\\nThe jacket gapes at the front, revealing his slim chest. Around his neck, the stiff high collar of an ivory, cotton dress shirt over which is draped a long violet and white silk scarf and the hint of a dark taupe and gold ribbon.\\n\\nThe velvet fabric hangs in heavy folds around his slight frame, cinched in at the waist with a belt tied in a bow. The jacket is lined with mustard satin that is only visible inside the left sleeve opening. The ample sleeves of the jacket fall back to his wrists, flaunting french cuffs and cuff links. His left arm is held mid-air and crooked at the elbow, palm facing out, fingers stretched up and curled in. \\n\\nHis right hand is deliberately placed on his right hip, with thumb to the rear and fingers with swollen knuckles splayed. \\n\\nIn the lower right-hand corner is a glass vase with a curved handle containing four stems of gladioli of varying lengths and colours red, pink and creamy white. In the lower left-hand corner is the artistâ€™s signature, G. Lambert, Sydney 1922.\\n\\n**Audio description written by Sally Dawson and voiced by Rory Walker**",

Henry Hankeâ€™s surprising win in 1934 was one. Hanke was 33 years of age and the first Sydney-born winner. A little-known artist, he struggled to survive and support his family during the Great Depression, with his only source of income a series of odd jobs and the government welfare program known as â€˜sustenance reliefâ€™. \\n\\nHanke ground his own pigments, re-used a donated frame and, unable to afford a model, looked in the mirror. The portrait took just eight hours to complete. When interviewed about Hankeâ€™s win, his former tutor JS Watkins responded: \\n\\nâ€˜When Hanke came to me eight or nine years ago, the one outstanding quality I recognised in him was his serious determination to make good â€“ his intense power of application, and his willingness to tackle hard work.â€™\\n\\nHanke is dressed in his down-on-his-luck workmanâ€™s clothes, yet his pluckiness and perseverance in winning the Archibald offered a story of hope for many Australians during the Depression. The portrait went on a celebratory national tour, with people flocking to locations around Australia to catch a glimpse of the work.",

Through the process of research and revelation, Woodward explores and reflects upon inner worlds, shared stories and the interconnectedness of life. Her subject matter is predominantly concerned with memory, place and the collective consciousness. \\n\\nIn this enigmatic self-portrait, Woodward has portrayed herself as her great-great-great grandmother Sarah Wisse, who was transported as a convict from Britain to New South Wales in 1795 for stealing food and clothing. The work explores ancestry, time and the concept of judgement, with Woodward stating: \\n\\nâ€˜[it] alludes to the notion of the miraculous draught of fishes: by being required to put a net out on the other side of lifeâ€™s boat, success was achieved together with a new beginning â€¦ The hints of text are like graffiti and are excerpts from Sarahâ€™s judgement seen between the barred background. She carries a bundle in her arms representing the items she was suspected of having stolen.â€™\\n\\nA former National Art School student, Woodward taught art at secondary schools and colleges in both Sydney and Perth. Six of her eight Archibald works are self-portraits, and she was awarded the Wynne Prize for landscape painting in 1971.",

His success brought the 51-year-old artistâ€™s obscurity to an end, thrusting the â€˜goat manâ€™ into the national consciousness. Opinions were mixed, however, with then Art Gallery of New South Wales director Edmund Capon labelling the trees â€˜bonsai vegetablesâ€™ and former Archibald winner Judy Cassab declaring, â€˜Itâ€™s beautifully painted and has a lot of humour.â€™\\n\\nIn this self-portrait, Robinson conjures traditional equestrian portraits and their association with aristocracy and privilege. He sits awkwardly astride a horse, without reins or bridle, looking uncertain. Robinson situates himself within his hallmark detailed and majestic landscape, with multiple and distorted perspectives and atmospheric use of colour. The work can be seen to parody both the pretentiousness that can arise in a highly sought-after annual art prize, and the self-important Archibald portraits from previous decades. \\n\\nRobinson, whose influences include the works of Pierre Bonnard, Henri Matisse and Paul CÃ©zanne, was a student at Brisbaneâ€™s Central Technical College in the 1950s. He drew inspiration from his cherished farm animals and the lush rainforest of Queenslandâ€™s Scenic Rim region, where he was living when awarded his first Archibald Prize with this work.",

Born in Hong Kong, Beynon lived in Singapore, Germany and England before emigrating to Australia. Now based in Melbourne, Beynon discovered early on that being creative and making art was a way to adjust and make connections to new places. Portraiture is integral to her practice as it provides an opportunity for Beynon to investigate and communicate her notions on personal history, hybridity, feminism and global culture. \\n\\nIn this self-portrait, the artist sits in a half-lotus position surrounded by a large swirling gold-scaled Chinese dragon and two green lion-dogs â€“ a reference to Beynonâ€™s Staffy-cross, Tudo. Beynon blends personal and universal signs and symbols to help make sense of her identity and, in this work, the demands she feels in balancing an artistic and family life. This is evident in her choice of pose, the dragon (a positive symbol of strength and resistance), the two playful canine companions, and her motherâ€™s jade pendant worn as a good luck charm. Beynon also draws on her interest in a range of traditional and contemporary pictorial sources, including animation, comic books, Chinese paintings and family connections.",

He has said about the portrait: \\n\\nâ€˜My wife Kate and I have been talking about getting a whippet for a while now. Our son Lars insists we name him Granny. We are keeping our eyes on the animal shelters and know that one day soon he will appear. We like to think he is out there looking for us as well.â€™\\n\\nA self-taught artist, Etherington started painting â€˜weird little thingsâ€™ to pass the time during a bleak winter in Edmonton, Canada 17 years ago. Etherington has since developed a distinctly personal style that references favourite television shows and movies from the 1980s and 1990s, childhood stories and daily family life. Through his use of colour and composition, Etheringtonâ€™s artworks provide an insight into his inner thoughts, perspectives and imaginative worlds, which are at times surreal, weird and nostalgic. His love for playful details â€“ here, the toy figurine and hose strewn on the grass, the lone yellow dandelion, and the seek-and-find lizard and spider hidden on the brick wall â€“ reconnect the viewer to particular collective references or personal memories that feel familiar yet unexpected.",

He brings our attention to the idea that the process of looking at images is culturally constructed and conditioned by the context of their display, and how this influences the viewerâ€™s perceptions and experience. \\n\\nEmploying humour, structural devices and schematic presentations â€“ including his generic title arrangement and yellow trademark logo that references a hanging picture â€“ Tyndall aims to disrupt our automatic responses and thoughts to encourage alternative ways of perceiving. Primarily a self-taught artist, Tyndall studied architecture at RMIT and the University of Melbourne, and has exhibited widely since the early 1970s.\\n\\nConcerning this self-portrait, Tyndall wrote: \\n\\nâ€˜The drawing was made while looking into a circular mirror. This was then centred into a larger preparatory design, ringed by the appropriate-to-the-occasion quotation from [British writer] Charles Morgan â€¦ all set within the matrix of our inter-connectedness â€¦ As with all of my artwork offerings, that which was/is to be beheld is the beholding projection of the beholder ... in this portraiture context, a self-portrait, as also indicated in my standard title.â€™\\n\\nThis â€“ Tyndall's only Archibald portrait â€“ was included in the 1991/92 Archibald Prize.",

Dawson had married Boddy in 1968, the year she was one of three women included in the National Gallery of Victoriaâ€™s influential exhibition of abstract works, The Field. With formal academic training in Melbourne and London, Dawson embraced non-objective art in the 1960s, adopting her own lyrical approach to abstraction, while maintaining a continual engagement with figurative work.\\n\\nA â€˜ten-pound Pomâ€™, Boddy emigrated to Australia in 1959 after studies at Cambridge. Throughout the 1960s, he appeared on stage and television and was part of the new wave of Australian theatre. Success came with the 1970 musical play The legend of King Oâ€™Malley, written by Boddy and Bob Ellis, and directed by John Bell, with designs by Dawson and Sue Lloyd. Described as gentle, erudite and private, Boddy later wrote books on food, home economics and sustainable living, following the coupleâ€™s move to the NSW Southern Tablelands, where they lived until Boddyâ€™s death.\\n\\nDawson injects vitality and spontaneity into her lyrical portrayal of Boddy, painted over four days in December 1973, with its delicate pink and cream hues, and broad brushstrokes.",

It was the third time the artist had selected Kitto as his subject, his portrait also appearing in the 1961 and 1964 competitions. Kitto successfully represented the Gallery in the court case that followed the controversial awarding of the 1943 Archibald to William Dobell for his portrait of artist Joshua Smith.\\n\\nJust over 30 years later, Kitto again became the centre of Archibald debate. Connorâ€™s portrayal of him was awarded the prize when John Bloomfieldâ€™s portrait of filmmaker Tim Burstall was disqualified, after the artist acknowledged it was painted from a photograph rather than â€˜from lifeâ€™ as the entry conditions stipulated. Connorâ€™s 1975 portrait of Kitto was his first Archibald success; he won again two years later with a portrait of artist Robert Klippel.",

Emigrating to America just two years later, Vickery is relatively unknown to the broader Australian public but recognised as an important artist of the international op art movement.\\n\\nDuring the 1950s, Vickery painted alongside artists of the abstract expressionist movement in New York, such as Joan Mitchell and Willem de Kooning. The disciplined and analytical approach of op art, however, was more in line with his precise handling of colour and composition, honed over decades as a successful commercial illustrator.\\n\\nWhile still in keeping with an academic tradition, the high-key palette and stippled, energetic brushwork of this self-portrait reflects Vickeryâ€™s burgeoning interest in cubism and the broken colour technique of the post-impressionists. The setting of the artistâ€™s trenchcoat-clad figure against a crisp wintery landscape â€“ his head framed by tufts of clouds â€“ lends a slightly surreal quality to this avant-garde self-portrait. Few Archibald subjects have been depicted in outdoor settings.",

In a departure from her French academic training, she began experimenting with pointillist colour theories and techniques. The work Manning produced at this time added to the first vital stage of modernist culture in Australia.\\n\\nBy the late 1920s, Manning returned to live in the family home in Bowral, New South Wales and concentrated on portrait commissions and teaching. Dattilo-Rubboâ€™s influence and the chromatic contrasts favoured by the early modernists, including contemporary Grace Cossington Smith, can be recognised in the rich palette of mauves and greens and loose, thick application of paint in this work. Manning renders an assured elegance and confidence in her pose and bold gaze, alluding both to George Lambertâ€™s hand gestures and Henry Hankeâ€™s stance in his 1934 winning portrait. \\n\\nManning believed in portraying a good â€˜likenessâ€™, writing in 1950: \\n\\nâ€˜By the word likeness I donâ€™t mean to imply a purely superficial representation, but something that goes deeper and portrays the character of the sitter as shown in both face and hands. This is only something which concentrated study and careful handling can reveal.â€™",

She had just spent two years of intense study under William Dargie at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. Although never strictly aligned with a certain art group or movement, Robertson adopted particular teachings and approaches to develop her own unique style and practice; one that reflected her training, fascination with people, concern for social justice, and her strong desire to capture the person behind the face. In this work, we can see Robertsonâ€™s outstanding draughtsmanship, the complex interplay between light and shade through her subtle palette choice, and an expressive yet fine handling of paint.\\n\\nIn the early to mid 1950s, Robertson exhibited regularly with The Adelaide Group and won several awards, but familial and financial obligations took precedence over painting and exhibiting, and she took up teaching. Due to personal circumstances and her quiet and self-effacing nature, Robertson is not as widely known or celebrated as some of her female Australian contemporaries, such as Judy Cassab. It is this quiet profundity, determination and honesty that is sensitively captured in this work.",

Her parents were interested in art, and encouraged Holmesâ€™ early passion for drawing, enrolling her into Hobart Technical School in 1918, where she learned tonal painting under Lucien Dechaineux. Another instructor, Mildred Lovett, taught her the modernist principles of colour and light, and suggested she spend a year at Julian Ashtonâ€™s Sydney art school, where she met artists Thea Proctor and George Lambert. Returning to Hobart, Holmes joined Lovett and Florence Rodway in their city studio, and was a founding member of the Tasmanian Group of Painters. She exhibited regularly in Melbourne and Sydney.\\n\\nThis portrait of Holmesâ€™ father, William Nassau Holmes, during his 75th year, was painted upon her return from Sydney and hung in the family dining room in Hobart until the artistâ€™s death. William was born in Ireland and studied at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England. Athletic and well-educated, he arrived in Tasmania in the 1880s, becoming a teacher, and later headmaster of the Burnie, West Devonport and Moonah State schools. Holmesâ€™ tightly structured yet sensitive portrait â€“ her first in the Archibald Prize â€“ shows her strong command of academic tonal realism. However, her bold use of opaque, powdery pigments paves the way for Holmes' mature works, with their vibrant palette and heavily encrusted surfaces.",

An impeccable draughtsman, Buckmaster was applauded for his â€˜crystal-clearâ€™ observations in light and colour, yet simultaneously faulted for lacking â€˜variation of the texture on the surface of the paintâ€™. As a foundation member of the Australian Academy of Art, in 1940 he opposed what he believed to be the extreme modernism of some members of the Contemporary Art Society, which he expressed in several letters written to the Melbourne Argus.\\n\\nThis highly finished yet sensitive portrayal of his mother â€“ Letitia Martha Buckmaster (nee Chandler, 1873â€“1953) â€“ that Buckmaster exhibited in the 1931 Archibald was painted in her 58th year. It was one of five known Archibald portraits of her by her eldest son, each a tender homage to the fortitude of a woman who had borne 11 children. As a critic for The Bulletin observed, â€˜His old lady in black is a three-volume novel in paint, and well written tooâ€™.\\n\\nA year later, in 1932, Buckmaster won the Archibald Prize with his portrait of Lieutenant-Governor Sir William Irvine. Some of his other notable Archibald subjects were Wulli Wulli tenor Harold Blair (1948), model and actor Jessica Harcourt (1936) and fellow Twenty Melbourne Painters Society member AME Bale (1932, 1934 and 1935).",

He received a doctorate in algebra and was ordained in 1934. Fearing the rise of Nazism, he migrated to London, then accepted the position of senior rabbi at Sydneyâ€™s Great Synagogue, which he took up in 1940. Porush was the â€˜uncrowned chief rabbi of Australiaâ€™ and the head of the rabbinical court (Av Beth Din). Although some people did not agree with his strong Orthodox position, his was revered for combining â€˜rabbinical learning, general scholarship and exceptional leadershipâ€™.\\n\\nPidgeon painted this portrait to celebrate Porushâ€™s 21st anniversary as rabbi at the synagogue, the earliest surviving one in New South Wales that is still in use. Porush is dressed in his liturgical vestments, including his á¹­allit (prayer shawl), standing at the bimah (reading platform) before the Ark.",

He became a celebrated athlete, later studying law at the University of Tasmania, and joined the BahÃ¡â€™Ã­ faith. In 1976 he changed his name from Harry Penrith to Burnum Burnum (great warrior), in honour of his great-grandfather, artist Tommy McRae, who created detailed pen and ink drawings of his life experiences in the late 1800s.\\n\\nOn 26 January 1988, in an act of defiance, Burnum Burnum planted the Aboriginal flag on the White Cliffs of Dover in England, symbolically invading Great Britain and declaring in irony, â€˜We wish no harm to [Englandâ€™s] nativesâ€™. He further pledged not to poison British waterholes, â€˜pickle and preserve the heads [...] of your people [...] sterilise your women, nor to separate your children from their familiesâ€™. At the time this portrait was painted, Burnum Burnum was advocating for changes to the Australian Constitution, to allow for seven additional Senate seats to represent Aboriginal people from each state and territory.\\n\\nBurnum Burnum appears here in one of Kerry Lesterâ€™s distinctive stitched canvases. Her other Archibald subjects included designer Trent Nathan (1989), rocker Jimmy Barnes (1999) and ophthalmologist Fred Hollows (1993). A self-professed â€˜Archibald bridesmaidâ€™, Lester never won the prize; her self-portrait, however, was awarded the 1998 Packing Room Prize.",

After receiving a licentiate of theology, he was posted to rural New South Wales, then Chicago in America, where he witnessed abject urban poverty. There he formed his belief that religion should be â€˜open to the world, reaching the unloved and unlovely who are in the immediate communityâ€™. Returning to Sydney, he assisted in opening the first Lifeline Centre. In 1964, Noffs established the Wayside Chapel, welcoming people of all faiths and backgrounds.\\n\\nAs a child, Tiiu Reissar escaped the Soviet invasion of Estonia with her family, fleeing to Berlin and spending World War II in a refugee camp. Displaced from their homeland, Reissarâ€™s family emigrated to New Zealand, and she completed studies in art and teaching. In 1960, Reissar arrived in Sydney and began teaching, and exhibiting her work. At one opening, she met Noffs, in whom she witnessed â€˜a kind of inner light that glowed from his personalityâ€™, and decided to paint him.\\n\\nFor this portrait, she took a 2-inch spatula and applied thick strokes of oil. This technique was introduced to her by a fellow Ã©migrÃ© artist, Latvian-born Reinis Zusters, who himself had 21 works in the Archibald. Reissar captured Noffs in his office, unwittingly placing his figure against a cross-like form. Noffs continued to agitate conservative church leaders until his death.",

Namatjira only became aware of the work of his famous great-grandfather, Albert Namatjira, when he returned to Ntaria as a young man. After several years working in land management on Country, he was encouraged by his wife Natasha and her family to explore his artistic heritage. Entirely self-taught, and dreaming of following in his great-grandfatherâ€™s footsteps, Vincent began a series of portraits, imagining Albertâ€™s turbulent life through photographs and newspapers. \\n\\nVincent recounted: \\n\\nâ€˜Behind the wheel of the green truck is my [great] grandfather, Albert Namatjira.

Esther studied alongside WB McInnes at the National Gallery School under Bernard Hall and later was the subject of McInnesâ€™ 1926 Archibald-winning portrait, Silk and lace. Musically gifted, Betty trained and performed as a classical singer. Esther and Betty also took classes at the Meldrum School of Painting, absorbing Max Meldrumâ€™s tonalist teachings.\\n\\nThe sisters became commercial artists. Their illustrations for The Bulletin, Punch and Lone Hand in the 1920s celebrated independent, modern womanhood and reflected the more liberal spirit of the decade. They were prominent members of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and, after World War II, ran classes for war veterans with disabilities.\\n\\nEstherâ€™s portrait of the exuberant Betty, then 43, was shown the year Nora Heysen became the first woman to win the Archibald Prize. This portrayal of a confident modern woman â€“ cigarette in hand and wine glass close by â€“ was immediately procured by prolific art collector and patron to Australian artists, Howard Hinton.

It was painted the year of Baleâ€™s first solo exhibition at the New Art Salon in Sydney. To date, Sweatmanâ€™s own 1922 portrait of Bale â€“ one of her four Archibald works â€“ has not been found.\\n\\nBoth artists were students alongside Max Meldrum at Melbourneâ€™s National Gallery School under Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall. As council members of the Victorian Artists Society, in 1919 they were instrumental in forming â€“ in sympathy with the aims and methods of Max Meldrum â€“ the breakaway group Twenty Melbourne Painters, which flourished under Baleâ€™s 36-year leadership. Exhibiting with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters, neither Sweatman nor Bale married or travelled overseas; however, Baleâ€™s work was hung both at the Paris Salon and Londonâ€™s Royal Academy. Sweatman gave much of her early career to portrait painting, later turning to landscape, particularly in the Warrandyte region, with fellow Archibald contributor Winifred McCubbin, whose work also features in Archie 100.\\n\\nBaleâ€™s evocative portrayal of her friend displays a free and supple handling of her medium, with every stroke carefully considered. It reveals her unique approach to Meldrumâ€™s tonalist method, and her reverence for the Dutch old masters Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer.",

They married in 1915. As for many women artists of the time, marriage and children took precedence over her career; however, in 1932, before a year-long European tour with her husband, Violet McInnes resumed painting.\\n\\nFrom the 1930s, McInnes was a frequent exhibitor with the Australian Academy of Art, Victorian Artists Society and the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, much admired for her lively flower paintings. She held her debut solo exhibition in 1937, the year she first entered the Archibald Prize with a portrait of WB. After the death of her husband in 1938, which was followed by her son Malcolm dying in an RAAF air crash in 1939, McInnes immersed herself in her art.\\n\\nMcInnes most likely met Sybil Craig (1901â€“89) while Craig was attending WBâ€™s classes at the National Gallery School in the late 1920s. In the 1940s, Craig cemented her place in the cityâ€™s modern art scene with her vivid, light-filled compositions. In 1945, she became the third woman appointed as an official war artist, painting women working in the munitions factories. McInnesâ€™ portrait reveals a chic, independent woman â€“ a vibrant figure in Melbourne society.",

She studied window dressing, millinery and art at East Sydney Technical College (now the National Art School), using her skills to dress her motherâ€™s Paddington store display. Aged 22, and recently married, Vaike Liibus opened her own millinery business; however, World War II intervened and her Piccadilly Arcade shop closed. During the war years she studied under Hayward Veal at Max Meldrumâ€™s Sydney school in Rowe Street, then at Julian Ashtonâ€™s art school in The Rocks, where her natural skill as a portraitist emerged.\\n\\nWidowed in 1954, Liibus took solace in her art. Two years later, her first Archibald work â€“ a portrait of artist Joshua Smith â€“ was selected as a finalist. She became a regular Archibald contributor, with all her portraits depicting men, six of them fellow artists. Liibusâ€™ reputation as a portrait painter grew, leading to numerous commissions, and her portrait of artist Guy Warren from the 1968 Archibald won the 1969 Portia Geach Memorial Prize.\\n\\nLiibusâ€™ 1958 Archibald portrait is of self-taught artist Gerard Havekes (1925â€“2011), whose public ceramic works adorn buildings across Australia. It shows the ebullient 33-year-old Dutch Ã©migrÃ© in a moment of quiet contemplation. Liibus painted directly from life, her loose brushwork and subtle palette underpinning an informality she sought in all her portraits.",

Growing up absorbing classical myths and legends, Martin was influenced by Clarkâ€™s explorations into the language of classicism and postmodernist theories. \\n\\nClarkâ€™s childhood in Rome inspired an early love of classical art, architecture and literature. His â€˜Jasperwareâ€™ series is based on Josiah Wedgwoodâ€™s mass-produced ornaments from the mid 1700s recalling ancient Greek vases.\\n\\nMartinâ€™s exquisitely rendered portrait of Clark â€“ who was then 50 and living in London â€“ reveals an intimate, measured exchange unfolding between sitter and painter, â€˜made concrete in paintâ€™. Martin recounts that the work plays with â€˜concepts of idealisation that are always present in the mentor/student relationshipâ€™. She positions Clark before one of his Jasperware paintings, hand resting on a classical pedestal, conjuring 19th-century photographic studio portraits. \\n\\nRevealing her motivation for taking up portraiture in the 1990s, at a time when the genre was seemingly moribund and immaterial, Martin wrote: \\n\\nâ€˜Painting portraits is quite an intimate process. The subject agrees to be looked at closely over many hours. This potentially makes them quite vulnerable. That is their gift to the painter, and I feel privileged for the time I have spent painting people.â€™",

Trained as an artist herself, Whiteley was an important muse of her husband Brett Whiteley (a two-time Archibald winner). She is also a curator and an esteemed arts patron; she established the Brett Whiteley Foundation in 1995.\\n\\nBieniek says she first met Wendy Whiteley at a dinner held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales:\\n\\nâ€˜I recognised her instantly. After our first conversation, I knew that I had to paint her. Iâ€™d spent the last 18 months painting inner-city landscapes and I couldnâ€™t believe that she had spent more than 20 years transforming unused railway land into a living sanctuary â€¦ Wendy has suffered much tragedy and hardship in her life but the garden symbolises how incredibly strong-willed and determined she is. It became her salvation and rescued her from a very dark place. Wendy is an inspiration. She has given the community a great gift that should be celebrated and enjoyed for years to come.â€™",

But after that period, I started to do performance pieces. My photography changed a bit because one of the things that I undertook was to photograph my own family which represented the Chinese in Australia. I claimed my heritage in the 80s because the Chinese part of me was always denied and unacknowledged.\\n\\nAnd the very first self-portrait was me standing in the cane fields in the place where my uncle had been shot. I somehow knew that this was an important event because the past and the present had somehow come together in this event. And that was a very important moment in my life. I kept doing self-portraits and Iâ€™ve done about 40 of them.\\n\\nGradually I evolved to tell my own story and just photograph things about my own life. Iâ€™m very happy that has happened because my life and my art have kind of joined together. And so I feel that Iâ€™m living my art as well as my life. And so thatâ€™s very satisfying for me.\\n\\nI had to come to terms with being Chinese, being gay and just feeling comfortable as a human being. There are lots of people who arenâ€™t comfortable about that, still. And so I try to be an example of being yourself and being visible. Thatâ€™s been my philosophy.",

Nine years later came _Cloud Street_ (1991), a work of distinctively Australian magic realism. The _Riders_ (1994), nominated for the Booker Prize, and _Dirt Music_ (2001), also Booker-nominated, established Wintonâ€™s unquestionable status as Australiaâ€™s most popular author. Winton describes himself as a â€˜coastal personâ€™, and in books such as _Dirt Music_ and _Breath_ (2008) the sea and shore are pervasive and penetrative, intrinsic to the drama rather than a backdrop against which events unfold. In addition to various works of non-fiction, Wintonâ€™s six books for children (including _Lockie Leonard, Legend_ 1997) have ensured his exposure at all levels. _Cloud Street_ was one of only two Australian books in the top ten of the ABCâ€™s list of Australiaâ€™s Most Popular Books in 2004. Winton is a passionate environmental advocate with a particular interest in marine conservation. When he won the WA Premierâ€™s Award for _Dirt Music_ he immediately donated the $25 000 prize money to the campaign to save Ningaloo Reef, north of Perth, from development. He is designated a Living National Treasure. A film adaptation of his 2005 short story collection, _The Turning_, was released in 2013, as was his eleventh novel, _Eyrie_.\\n\\nQuentin Jones (b. 1962) worked for Fairfax publications and it was in this capacity that he travelled to Albany with a writer from the _Good Weekend_ to spend a day with Winton in his teenage haunts in August 2004. 'We drove around Albany,' he recalls, 'looking at various places he used to hang out at. The weather was horrible and I was desperate for a good shot. We went to Cheyne Beach, where his family used to go camping. Tim had his red parka but I was less prepared. I had almost given up on getting a good shot, when the clouds parted and the setting sun shone through. I lined up a shot and managed to shoot nine frames before the rain came back. But it wasnâ€™t until I was looking at the shots days later in Sydney, that I noticed that breaking wave. Magic.'",

This chic 1986 image of Nehm in sunglasses was used on the invitation card for the opening of the influential _NADOC '86 Exhibition of Aboriginal and Islander Photographers_ at the Aboriginal Artists Gallery in Sydney. As Riley noted in _Racism, representation and photography_ (Inner City Education Centre, 1989): 'I just want to show young Aboriginal people living in the cities today; a lot of them are very sophisticated and a lot of them are very glamorous. A lot of them have an air of sophistication which you don't see coming across in newspapers and television programs. I'm just talking about positive things really, positive images of Aboriginal people.' Nehm has appeared in numerous Australian films and television series including Bruce Beresford's _The Fringe Dwellers_ (1986), _The Flying Doctors_ (1989) and _A Country Practice_ (1991). She was an assistant director on the mini-series _Heartland_ (1994) and has worked as a producer for SBS.",

Born in Brisbane, she graduated from the Queensland College of Art in 1982. After moving to Sydney, Moffatt became widely known through her celebrated first solo exhibition, _Something More_ (1989). In 1990 her short film _Night Cries â€“ A Rural Tragedy_ (1989) was selected for official competition at the Cannes Film Festival, as was her first feature-length film, _Bedevil_, in 1993. She was invited to exhibit in the Venice Biennale in 1997, and during that year held solo exhibitions in Germany, Denmark, France and the USA. Moffatt became the first Aboriginal artist to present a solo exhibition, _My Horizon_, at the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017.\\n\\nPhotographer Michael Riley and Moffatt met when they both worked at the Sydney College of the Arts in 1985. When Moffatt co-curated the _NADOC '86 Exhibition of Aboriginal and Islander Photographers_ at the Aboriginal Artists Gallery, she immediately thought of Riley. This portrait of Moffatt was included in that exhibition. The following year they were both among the co-founders of the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative. Riley also worked on Moffatt's first film _Nice Coloured Girls_ (1987), while completing his Film Australia traineeship.",

For many years she has been a fierce and tireless activist for her Country, community and culture, spearheading campaigns on issues such as the protection of Gomeroi sacred sites and the environmental impacts of mining. A direct descendant of the Weraerai clan, members of which were murdered in the Waterloo Creek and Myall Creek massacres of the late 1830s, Cutmore is also a leading advocate for truthtelling about these atrocities.\\n\\nPhotographer Jessica Hromas met Cutmore in 2021 when she travelled to Moree to do a series of portraits and interviews around the history of the Moree Baths. The formerly segregated municipal swimming pool was the site of a key protest during the 1965 Freedom Rides, led by Arrernte and Kalkadoon activist Charles Perkins. Hromas had photographed Perkins' funeral for the Sydney Morning Herald and, as a non-Indigenous person, felt compelled to learn from Aboriginal people who'd grown up in Moree and had firsthand experience of 'Australia's very own apartheid.' Cutmore helped facilitate the project, and this portrait came about as a result. \\n\\n'It reminds me of all my ancestors â€¦ I can see all of them coming through in that picture, and their struggles, and their hopes', Cutmore says of the photograph. 'I think it shows the journey I've been on â€¦ that we can come through strong-looking, and as survivors.'",

Formerly a talented rugby league player, at sixteen he moved to Sydney to study at the Aboriginal and Islander Dance Theatre. Overcoming his initial rebellion at the discipline of dance, he quickly became 'pure spirit' in performance, equally breathtaking as an earth-bound or aerial dancer. With brothers Stephen, an artistic director, and David, a composer, he co-founded the Bangarra Dance Theatre, and was its principal artist from 1991. He also appeared on film and television, including a role in Tracey Moffatt's _Bedevil_. The Bangarra production _Walkabout_ received ecstatic reviews from critics, with Russell's solo singled out for special praise. He died in July 2002, leaving his family, his three children, and Australian art, dance and Aboriginal communities mourning an irreplaceable loss.\\n\\nMoffatt took this photograph when Page was with the Aboriginal and Islander Dance Theatre in Sydney. The image shows his intense physicality and natural grace. It is part of a series of five black-and-white photographs depicting Russell and his brother Stephen, _Some lads_, which featured in the NADOC 86 Exhibition of Aboriginal and Islander Photographers.",

Orphaned at ten, he was educated by the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Monivae College in Hamilton, Victoria. He studied law at Monash University and in 1981 became Victoriaâ€™s first Aboriginal barrister. In 1988 he gained national attention as counsel assisting the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. As Australia's first Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner from 1993 to 1998 he co-authored the _Bringing Them Home_ report that illuminated the history of the Indigenous people who became known as the Stolen Generations. Dodson is an Emeritus Professor at the Australian National University and was Director of the ANU National Centre for Indigenous Studies from its establishment in 2005 until 2018. 'Upholding human rights is about looking out for each other,' Dodson has stated, 'sometimes we donâ€™t speak up when we should.'\\n\\nRicky Maynard is an Indigenous Tasmanian photographer who was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery to create this portrait of Dodson in 2010. 'I wanted the portrait to express a quiet strength and dignity. One thing that comes through in all of my work is the indomitable spirit of Aboriginal people. I do not strive for it, but it always presents itself in some way â€¦ Here you have two strong Aboriginal men involved in the picture-making act and as well as having culture as a bond we are both humanitarians.'",

Photo by Ingvar Kenne, 2009.\\n\\nThe portrait is approx. one metre square showing a full length, standing view of Alexis in a blackened, burnt-out landscape of predominately bare trees.  \\nThe upper half of the photograph features a pale, greyish-white sky with tall, burnt tree trunks extending up and out to the sky beyond. In the upper left corner, several trees twist and bend across each other.\\n\\nIn the background and halfway down the photo, the hazy curve of a distant hill crosses through the landscape. Numerous blackened and bare trees cover the sloping ground in front.\\n\\nThe figure of Alexis occupies the centre and lower half of the scene. To the left of Alexis and slightly behind, a large black tree trunk stands tall, reaching up and out beyond the portrait. Sprouting from the trunk are several bright green patches of leafy new growth. \\n\\nAlexis stands on a sloped area of ash covered earth, left blackened and charred by fire.  \\nShe looks directly at us, eyes squinting, mouth closed, with a look of sadness or dismay. Her auburn shoulder length hair is slightly curly, and part of her fringe is swept back. A segment hangs raggedly on her forehead.\\n\\nThe left side of her body is angled slightly forward, and she wears a black round- necked top under a black zippered jacket. Her zipper open to mid-torso, the jacket lining and collar is a dark grey,. Both her hands are tucked into her practical jacket pockets. Her pale right hand is partly visible. \\n\\nAlexis wears long black pants and tan coloured moccasins.\\n\\nBurnt branches, twigs and debris are scattered around her. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Pauline McCreath and voiced by Rory Walker**",

The 'booing saga' sparked national debate about racism and became the subject of two documentary films, both released in 2019. That year, the AFL formally apologised to Goodes for not taking greater action as events unfolded.",

I knew it was a big musical, so I thought, â€˜Oh yeah, I'm not bad at didge. I learned off some pretty good mob, so maybe I can get in thereâ€™. 'Cause there was a 6-month tour of Australia, so I could just play didge and not have to do much at all, no dancing and singing and acting. I'll just be their didge player. So maybe I can get away with it like that and not do much â€“ get to tour around Australia, just playing didge, wouldn't that be good? Without having to do much, lazy bastard. But yeah, no, it ended up they wanted me to dance, sing and act. So, do a course and then you get selected. So I did that and then ended up in _Bran Nue Dae_, toured Australia for six months. Then after that did a couple more plays on stage, then got into television and then the rest is history. Yeah, kept on getting other series and little parts in movies and documentaries and mini-series.\\n\\nI was brought up in Kalgoorlie. Yeah, I was adopted when I was six to eight weeks old, in Derby. My mother already had my older brother and sister and was in an unstable situation. So willingly give me up for adoption, which was lucky for me. But like yeah, no mother likes to give their babies up for adoption. But my mob are from â€¦ my grandmother, on my mother's side, yeah, a lot of them live in Broome. But my grandfather was from Lombadina or Djarindjin. In between Broome and Derby there's Cape Leveque, and mostly on the point is Lombadina or Djarindjin, which is Buntjut, people that are Buntjut and their language is Bunyul. And then my grandmother was from Fitzroy Crossing, which is Bunaba. And my father's side was from Northern Territory. I think I met my father when I was 21 but he's since passed away. We buried him in Katherine in 2005. Got to meet my older brother and sister and still two brothers I haven't met yet. They were out bush or somewhere, Daniel and Damien, so... But yeah, that's where my people come from. But yeah, I was adopted, brought up in Kalgoorlie.",

A teenager when he won the lead role in Black Swan Theatre's premiere of the musical _Bran Nue Day_, he has performed professionally for the past 25 years. In 2008 at the Sydney Theatre Awards he was named best actor for _Ngapartji Ngapartji_. Jamieson conceived the play, about his Central Desert family who were displaced by the Maralinga tests of the 1950s, in collaboration with Scott Rankin. In 2011 he was the star of another collaboration with Rankin, the critically acclaimed Namatjira. Jamieson has appeared in many movies including _Rabbit Proof Fence_ (2002) and _Bran Nue Day_ (2009). In the 2019 remake of the 1976 film _Storm Boy_ he portrayed Fingerbone Bill, originally played by David Gulpilil. The film _The Furnace_, in which he starred with David Wenham, featured at the 2020 Venice Film Festival.\\n\\nThis portrait of Jamieson won the People's Choice Award for the National Photographic Prize of 2017. Brett Canet-Gibson took the photograph in the grounds of the University of Western Australia on a spring-stained Sunday afternoon, using natural light and a portable backdrop. Performing with the Ochre Contemporary Dance Company in a production called _Kaya_, Trevor was about to go through his warm-up process before mesmerising his sold-out, closing-night audience.",

After appearing on stage and television in Sydney in the 1960s, Weaver won an AFI award for her performance in _Stork_ (1971). A string of films followed including _Alvin Purple_ (1973) and _Caddie_ (1976), for which she won a second AFI award. During the 1980s and 1990s she acted in theatre productions _The Cherry Orchard_, _A Streetcar Named Desire_ and _Death of a Salesman_, among many others. She made her Hollywood debut with _The Five-Year Engagement_ (2012) and received her second Oscar nomination for her role in _Silver Linings Playbook_ (2012). Since then she has appeared in a host of US and Australian productions, among them _Last Cab to Darwin_ (2015), _Secret City_ (2016â€“2019), _Bird Box_ (2018), _Widows_ (2018) and _Stage Mother_ (2020). \\n\\nPhotographer John Tsiavis noted of this work: 'My intent for this portrait was to capture the power and force Jacki conjures when acting. She is not representing a specific character or role, however I wanted to convey the complexity and depth of her acting, as though captured in a moment performing Shakespeare or a Greek tragedy.'",

After travel studies in Germany, France and Spain between 1904 and 1907 she returned to Adelaide to take on an increased teaching load. In 1912 she went to London, spending seven years there and in Europe before marrying and setting up house in the Sydney harbourside suburb of Mosman in 1920. Based in Sydney for the rest of her life, though travelling extensively, she campaigned vigorously on behalf of modern art while bringing forth a large body of robust paintings and prints. Preston was one of the first artists to recognise the significance and aesthetic power of Indigenous Australian art, the influence of which can be seen in some of her own work. She also saw the beauty in the native flowers and trees from which contemporaries such as Thea Proctor recoiled. Since the 1980s, many of her works have numbered amongst the most recognisable images of Australian art. The major Art Gallery of New South Wales retrospective, _Margaret Preston: Art and Life_ toured in 2005.",

On his return to Sydney after a decade he managed to impress conservative and modernist art factions alike. In World War 2, before being appointed an official war artist, he served in a camouflage unit and the Civil Construction Corps; great portraits, including The Billy Boy, arose from this experience. Dobell was devastated by the fallout from his contested winning portrait of artist Joshua Smith in the 1943 Archibald Prize, but rallied to win both the Wynne Prize for landscape and the Archibald Prize in 1948. He won another Archibald in 1959, and Time commissioned his portrait of Robert Menzies for its cover in 1960. These and other successes of Dobellâ€™s, including his knighthood, conferred in 1966, contributed to a rise in the status of artists in Australia.",

Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia.\\n\\nI was approached by a magazine from America to do this particular job for a special issue that is coming out within a week or two, and for that purpose I had to travel to Canberra and interview the Prime Minister in the offices of Parliament House. And there I made my studies. They consisted of small watercolour paintings, and I think altogether I had about 40 minutes with the Prime Minister for this purpose.\\n\\nI always paint, as I think, a straight portrait and I go for the character of the person and, in this case, I think there was very strong character and Iâ€™d be very foolish to play around and do silly things with an international figure of that type. And I think I got a fairly good job done in the time allowed me.\\n\\nOh well, weâ€™ll see the results when they come out.\\n\\nUsually I like to get to know a person well before I do a portrait, sometimes at least a week, or have a few drinks with them or dine with them, to get them relaxed and to pick out their salient mannerisms. In the case of Mr Menzies, I have only met him once or twice over a period of about 15 years, socially, so I really didnâ€™t know him, which made the job more difficult. And in this particular case, in the surrounds of Parliament House and offices, there is a tenseness, and relaxing was really a frightening business. I couldnâ€™t really relax, and I had to take my studies away, then try to get everything from that build-up, with what I remembered of him. As I say, I didnâ€™t really know the man well.",

But with me it just stuck, and all through school I liked drawing much better than any of the other lessons., as a matter of fact I was very poor at the other lessons. In the town of Newcastle where I lived there were no opportunities to study art, so I took the next best thing. I became apprenticed to an architect. Although that was mechanical drawing, in a way it satisfied me for the time being.\\n\\nThen I was able to come to Sydney later on, and I gave away architecture and started to study art at an art school.\\n\\nAs you go through studying, you get more and more keen, and then â€“ well, you just get into it. I went away to England on scholarships and studied abroad and saw the best works all around the world. It really becomes a mania, eventually, in art.\\n\\nI have often been asked what it is that makes me want to paint certain people. Well, I think, first of all, itâ€™s the interesting form, the sculptural form of the person and the strong characters of a person, the strong individuality. And I strive for that. I donâ€™t know whether other artists do it or not, but personally I like to fit them to my style. I see them as my style of painting and try to bring that style first. Itâ€™s a sculptural technique, more like sculpture than painting. And if I see those things in a person, well, I strive for it like a piece of sculpture. I particularly like the Gothic type of sculpture, and I try to get that into my better works.",

During the 1940s his work became fashionable throughout Australia and he was the subject of a biography and a film. In 1954 he met the Queen in Canberra, and he was awarded citizenship status in 1957. One of the consequences of citizenship was that Namatjira was legally entitled to buy alcohol, but when he shared it with his fellow Arrernte, as custom required, he was sentenced to imprisonment. Although the sentence was commuted, he never recovered, and died the following year. Nearly 50 years after his death, Namatjira remains the best-known of Australian Aboriginal painters.",

The couple met through Seidler's connection with her father, Clive Evatt QC, then Minister for Housing in the New South Wales government. Reflecting on her first impressions of Harry, Penelope said 'There was something about his power of expression and his determination', a refreshing contrast to the 'other boys', whose conversations concerned 'cars and drinking beer'. Penelope was studying at the University of Sydney pursuing philosophy, history and anthropology before switching to architecture. Becoming a registered architect in 1964, Penelope joined Harry Seidler & Associates, and was made a director of the company two years later.\\n\\nAccording to Penelope, her husband Harry Seidler 'was so â€¦ committed and so sincere and revolutionary â€¦ I could really see that he had drive'. Much of this drive was directed towards the application of modernist principles in architecture, with his vision seeing him winning every major Australian prize in the discipline. Among Harry's most noteworthy designs was 'Killara', the family home he and Penelope created. It won the 1967 Wilkinson Award, presented by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects for a design of outstanding merit. Harry passed away in 2006, and Penelope continues to steer their shared legacy, as Director of Harry Seidler & Associates.\\n\\nThis elegant and sophisticated studio portrait was taken by John Hearder on the young couple's wedding day in 1958.",

With the intensification of development as we know it, that will be the most sought after thing â€“Â  to be able to look out and see nothing but trees and nature rather than any other manmade thing.\\n\\nIn my early years I used to build things out of timber and light construction, but after seeing these things perform over the years, and travelling more and seeing the great buildings of the past, I just donâ€™t want to have anything to do with the so-called new things very often that are sold every Monday morning, something brilliant and new made out of flimsy metal or plastics and so on. Masonry â€“ thereâ€™s no getting away from it and I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a replacement for it as yet, the solidity of masonry. It will not decay, it wonâ€™t need maintenance. It is thermally more stable, buildings are cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter that are made of that material. And buildings should be tough, they should be able to take abuse by both people and the elements, just like those great buildings of the past, they invariably used tough materials and theyâ€™ve lasted for hundreds of years.\\n\\nIâ€™ve always been influenced by painters and sculptors. Gropius used to call them the sensitive translators of the impacts of our time. I love, of course, to have their works around me and thatâ€™s why I love collecting paintings. They not only are great to be with but they actually teach us many things visually. The successful interplay between art and our technology, thatâ€™s what itâ€™s really all about.",

Both this interest in the buildings that I was doing and the fact that I was having success â€“ and one must remember, in those days, it was terribly difficult even for an architect of Breuerâ€™s standing to get jobs in New York, to get a house to build and here I was almost swamped with opportunities â€“ and thatâ€™s one of the things that really endeared this country to me. Elsewhere in the world, I think, one has to have grey hair before anyone trusts you with their money to build them anything. And here was a man in his early twenties and people were wanting me to actually build things for them and I thought, â€˜Well, how marvellous, how outgoing for these people to have this sudden trust in somebody obviously young and inexperiencedâ€™. I think it was probably that, and, of course, the marvellous climate and the easy way of living that, you know, made me love this place.\\n\\nWhat did upset me very much though were the obstacles that were put in the way of my work by the authorities. Almost right from the start, every time I designed a house and submitted it to local council it was refused on the grounds of design. The term was, it was disallowed â€˜in the public interestâ€™, and it did not fit into the pleasantness of the neighbourhood or the amenities of the area, and so on. That just made me see red. And the only recourse was to a court of law in those days, you had to go to Land and Valuation Court. And that became quite a routine.\\n\\nThe almost embarrassing thing was the amount of press publicity given to it and I started to have a, you know, the reputation of somebody who fights councils more than builds houses. There is something, of course, in the Australian make-up that cheers when an individual can stand up successfully against authority.",

Advertisements describe Kruger as an â€˜Upholsterer, Paperhanger and Manufactor of Mattressesâ€™, in which capacities he worked in both Rutherglen and Taradale in the early 1860s. By late 1866 he had sold up, moved to Melbourne and taken up photography, one of his earliest known productions being a group portrait of the Aboriginal cricket team that was engraved for publication in the _Illustrated Australian News._ Working from premises in Carlton and later Prahran and Preston in the 1870s, Kruger made his name with his landscape photographs, some of which were awarded medals at exhibitions in Vienna and Philadelphia in 1873 and 1876 respectively. At the Geelong Industrial Exhibition of 1879â€“1880 Kruger exhibited a three-metre long panorama of the city and also created â€˜a splendid series of views of the Exhibition building and its contents, including special pictures of the fernery and fountain and particular exhibits.â€™ By this time Kruger had moved to Geelong, further photographs of which won him an award at the 1880 Melbourne International Exhibition. \\n\\nRegarding portraiture, Kruger is remembered for his photographs of the residents of Coranderrk, an agricultural settlement near Healesville established in 1863 as a result of lobbying on the part of Aboriginal leaders for land on which dispossessed people could build a community. By 1876, when it was reported that Kruger had â€˜executed photos of aboriginal life and native sceneryâ€™ â€“ the majority of which were â€˜scenes from the Coranderrk mission stationâ€™ â€“ the settlement had become a productive farming property. In this context, Krugerâ€™s early images of Coranderrk people and scenes would have been read as indicators of the degree to which Aboriginal people might adapt to non-Aboriginal ways. The images Kruger subsequently made for the Victorian Board for the Protection of Aborigines, however, reflected the tension that emerged when white authorities, noting Coranderrkâ€™s commercial value, began to call for its closure and the separation and relocation of its people. In this light, Krugerâ€™s portraits are part of the nineteenth-century practice of documenting people and cultures whose disappearance was held to be inevitable. Krugerâ€™s photograph of Rose Walcoriot (c. 1828â€“1893), dubbed â€˜Queen Roseâ€™, a Watha Wurrung or Wathaurung (Waddawurrung) woman from the Ballarat area, featured in his _Album of Victorian Aboriginals, Kings, Queens & c_., a compilation of twelve carte de visite portraits pitched at a general, souvenir-hunting audience.",

The only child of barrister and Hunter Valley settler, Richard Windeyer, and his wife, Maria, Windeyer was one of the first students to graduate from the University of Sydney. He was admitted to the Bar in 1857 and later the same year married Mary Bolton (1837â€“1912) who, after raising their nine children, established her own profile as a philanthropist and womenâ€™s rights campaigner. Influenced in part by the experiences of his mother, who as a widow had retained and managed the family estate, Windeyer too developed a particular interest in womenâ€™s rights. This interest was expressed in his (sometimes controversial) judicial compassion for female victims of male violence; in his support for matters such as divorce law reform; and in his introduction of the Married Womenâ€™s Property Act (1879), which enabled women to retain control of assets they brought to or earned within a marriage. Windeyer first entered Parliament in June 1859, serving in the Legislative Assembly as the member for Lower Hunter until 1860 and then representing West Sydney and the University of Sydney at different periods until 1879. Retiring from politics after two and a half years as attorney- general, Windeyer was appointed to the bench of the Supreme Court. Windeyer was also a strong supporter of education and throughout his career maintained an association with Sydney University: he was vice- chancellor between 1883 and 1886, chancellor in 1895-96 and a founding chairman of the Womenâ€™s College, established in 1891. Windeyer received an honorary doctorate from the University of Cambridge in 1887 and a knighthood in 1891. He retired from the New South Wales Supreme Court in ill health in 1896 and died suddenly the following year, his obituary noting the â€˜true heart [that] beat under his rough exteriorâ€™ and his genuine concern for those in distress.",

All that he may hope for is, after years of toil laboriously spent in trying to do his duty, that he may win the confidence of the intelligent thinking portion of the community, those who are interested in maintaining law and order, those who desire to see the rights of property respected, and every citizen protected, as far as the right administration of justice can protect him, in the enjoyment of his personal liberty, in his character and in the exercise of his rights. And when the public has thoroughly come to understand that his only desire is to see the right succeed and the truth established, juries may feel confident that they may safely accept such advice and assistance in their deliberations as it comes within the province of a judge to offer. Of popularity beyond this he can know nothing\\n\\nThe duties he has to discharge are often disagreeable, and sometimes painful. Indeed, one of the drawbacks attending the judicial position was that it very much cut one off from social intercourse with oneâ€™s fellow citizens in a small society like this, where everyone was known, and where so many who might be known as acquaintances, were frequently before the Court, as parties to proceedings before it. So, one must be careful to avoid all appearance of evil occasion for scandal.",

The first of Margaret and Williamâ€™s seven children â€“ four sons and three daughters â€“ was born in 1835. The family resided in Hobart until the early 1860s, when Roberston relocated to his Victorian estate, where Margaret died in February 1866.",

A farmerâ€™s son, Robertson came to Van Diemenâ€™s Land in 1822 and took up land before going into business with his brothers in an emporium in Hobart. In September 1834, he married Margaret Whyte (1811â€“1866), the daughter of fellow Scottish settlers. In 1835, Robertson joined a number of other investors in a scheme to expand pastoral activities into the Port Phillip district. Over the course of the next decade, he became a major landholder in the new colony, with substantial holdings in the area around Colac. He oversaw the operation of his pastoral empire from his Hobart home until 1852 and settled permanently at his Victorian property, Corangamarah, later called The Hill, in the early 1860s. The group of donated Robertson family photographs includes hand-coloured daguerreotypes of William and Margaret, and of their second eldest son, William junior (1839â€“1892). Also in the group are portraits of William Robertson junior's wife, Martha Mary Robertson (nee Murphy, 1844-1909) depicted with their eldest child, William St Leonards Robertson (1864-1950) - who is also the subject of this work.",

Robertson was born and educated in Hobart and then at Wadham College, Oxford. He is believed to be the first Australian to row in an Oxford eight, his team victorious against Cambridge in the Boat Race of 1861. Robertson graduated with a BA in 1862 and was married and called to the bar the following year. On his return to Australia, Robertson practised law in Hobart before heading to Victoria in 1864. He worked as a barrister in Melbourne and then assisted in the management of the family property, Corangamarah, which he and his three brothers jointly inherited on the death of their father in 1874. Robertson served as a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly between 1871 and 1874 and again from 1881 to 1886; he was also President of the Colac Shire council in 1880â€“81. After the dissolution of the partnership with his brothers in 1885, Robertson became sole owner of Corangamarah, later called The Hill, and in retirement enjoyed the lifestyle of an â€˜hospitable and sports-loving country gentleman.â€™",

Born in Jeparit, Victoria, Menzies attended school in Ballarat and studied at Melbourne University, where he gained a reputation as a brilliant speaker. Following early success at the Bar and in state politics, he entered Federal parliament in 1934. He became Prime Minister in 1939 as leader of the United Australia Party, but bitter divisions led to his resignation and the disintegration of the UAP. From the back benches, Menzies founded the Liberal Party, which he led from 1944 to 1966. As Prime Minister through a period of remarkable national prosperity, Menzies cultivated the USA as a 'powerful friend', furthering the two nations' economic and military ties. A staunch monarchist, he was invested as a Knight of the Thistle and succeeded Winston Churchill as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1965 to 1978.",

The youngest of eight children, Fraser grew up in the Sydney suburb of Balmain and took up swimming partly because it helped alleviate her asthma. She scored her first national championship title in the 220 yards freestyle in 1955. Later that year, she set new Australian records in four events and in early 1956 won the national 110 and 220 yards freestyle titles, the latter in world record time. At the Melbourne Olympics, Fraser established another world record in winning the 100m freestyle and was part of the gold medal-winning 4 x 100 metres relay team. She won the 100 metres again in Rome in 1960 and in Tokyo in 1964, making her the first swimmer, male or female, to win the same event at three consecutive Olympics. In total, between 1956 and 1964, Fraser broke thirty-nine world records, won four gold and four silver Olympic medals, and became the first woman to swim 100 metres freestyle in under a minute. She might have won the race again, but for a competition ban of ten years imposed after she was arrested for souveniring an Olympic flag. In 1999, Fraser was named Worldâ€™s Greatest Living Female Water Sports Champion by the International Olympic Committee; and Australian Female Athlete of the Century by the Sports Australia Hall of Fame. Australian of the Year in 1964, she later worked as a publican and served a term in the New South Wales Parliament as the independent member for Balmain. Fraser was named a Living National Treasure in 1998 and in 2000 was one of seven Australian women athletes involved in lighting the cauldron at the Sydney Olympic Games. \\n\\nDavid Moore (1947â€“2003) began his career in photojournalism in Sydney before taking up a job with Life and Time magazines in London in 1952. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s he carried out assignments in the UK, Europe, Africa and the USA, his work appearing in publications such as the Observer, the New York Times and Sports Illustrated. He returned to Sydney in the 1970s. Moore photographed Fraser at a Melbourne pool during training for the Tokyo Olympics.",

His professional career began in 1957 at the Phillip Street Theatre, where his first job was as understudy for Barry Humphries and Gordon Chater in _Around the Loop_. A brief time in London was followed by seasons with the Ensemble Theatre in Kirribilli and at Melbourne's Union Theatre Repertory Company. In the mid 1960s he performed with the new South Australian Theatre Company before returning to Sydney for a fifteen-month stint in _A Cup of Tea, A Bex and a Good Lie Down_ with Ruth Cracknell. The show was his entrÃ©e into television; he hosted a Saturday night show called _I'm Alright Now_ before appearing regularly on _The Mavis Bramston Show_. After appearing in _Hair_ in 1969, he was in _Jesus Christ Superstar_. His big break came with the role of Frank'n'Furter in _The Rocky Horror Show_ in 1974. The following year, his own _Betty Blokk Buster Follies_ played to record crowds in capital cities around the country. \\n\\nHe resurfaced on television in the late 1980s, presenting on _Burke's Backyard_ and later on Our House. He has since performed in his own theatre restaurant show _The Thank You Dinner_; in Gilbert and Sullivan at the Sydney Opera House and the State Theatre; and in major musical theatre productions including _The Producers_, _My Fair Lady_ and _Wicked_. His memoir _Stages_ was published in 2018. \\n\\nRobert McFarlane has photographed key figures in politics and the performing arts. His portrait of Livermore at the beginning of his career shows him as an urbane young man, and â€“ in the manner of McFarlane's famous 1964 photo of Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins â€“ is very evocative of its place and time. In 1965 Livermore was performing in _A Cup of Tea, A Bex and a Good Lie Down_ with Ruth Cracknell at Phillip Street Theatre.",

In the summer of 1964â€“65, as a student at the University of Sydney, Perkins organised a student bus tour around New South Wales to draw attention to the poor state of Indigenous health, education and housing, and to try and stimulate local action. Referred to as the 'freedom rides', it highlighted the state of race relations in Australia. The students protested and demonstrated against racial segregation and discrimination, culminating in overwhelming support for the 1967 Federal Government referendum which gave a clear mandate to implement policies to benefit First Nations people.\\n\\nRobert McFarlane recalls that he took this famous photograph of Perkins at night as he was going to, or returning from, mentoring country boys at Tranby Aboriginal Co-operative College, an independent learning environment for adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This introspective, seemingly isolated, portrayal of Perkins contrasts with his political activism in leading the 'freedom rides', recognised as one of Australia's most significant civil rights events.",

He acquired land and became involved in overlanding livestock before settling in South Australia in 1839. In May of that year, he set out on an expedition that took him to the Spencer Gulf and towards the Flinders Ranges. He then went to Port Lincoln and traversed the peninsula that now bears his name, returning via the Gawler Ranges and Lake Torrens. In January 1840 he learned of a planned expedition to find an overland route to the west. Eyre persuaded the organisers to refocus the expedition on the north, agreeing to pay for half of this bid to â€˜discover the inland of Australiaâ€™. He departed Adelaide again in June 1840 and proceeded to his depot at Mount Arden, at the head of the Spencer Gulf. Eyreâ€™s various attempts to continue north in search of fertile land were thwarted by vast expanses of salt lakes. He made it north east to a rise he named Mount Hopeless, in the Flinders Ranges, before returning to the depot. He then decided to head west across the Bight with a party comprising his assistant, John Baxter, and three Aboriginal men. Several gruelling months into the trip, Baxter was killed and two of the other members of the party disappeared. Eyre and his remaining Aboriginal colleague, Wylie, staggered into Albany on 7 July 1841. Six years later Eyre was rewarded for the journey with the Founderâ€™s Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1844, after having served as Protector of Aborigines in South Australia, he sailed home. His career ended contentiously in Jamaica in 1865 after he had violently quelled what he perceived as a coming rebellion. He was exonerated by a Royal Commission, but a welter of court proceedings ensued in England, with a register of the eminent persons of the day taking sides for and against his actions. For the last twenty-five years of his life Eyre lived on a pension in seclusion with his family near Tavistock, England.\\n\\nJulia Margaret Cameron (1815â€“1879) is considered one of the nineteenth centuryâ€™s pre-eminent photographers. A mother of six, Cameron took up photography at age forty-eight after receiving a camera as a gift. Largely self-taught, she converted a chicken coop into a studio and between 1864 and 1875 produced images that explored the â€˜high artâ€™ possibilities of a mechanical medium. Cameron employed her family, friends and acquaintances as models, but is best known for having created portraits of Victorian luminaries, including Charles Darwin, Alfred Tennyson and John Herschel.",

Prior to this, the colony had been administered by governors who, from 1824, governed with the assistance of a Legislative Council. The end of convict transportation, the gold rush, and other economic and social developments of the 1840s and 1850s contributed to demands for a more democratic system of government. A committee chaired by William Charles Wentworth (1790â€“1872) drew up a new constitution which was assented to by the British government in 1855. The first elections for the Legislative Assembly were held in March and April 1856, with the new Parliament meeting for the first time in May. The first ministry was sworn in in June 1856, its members being (left to right): Thomas Holt (1811â€“1888), treasurer; Sir William Manning (1811â€“1895), attorney-general; Sir Stuart Donaldson (1812â€“1867), premier; Sir John Darvall (1809â€“1883), solicitor-general; and George Robert Nichols (1809â€“1857), auditor-general and secretary for works.",

He started work at the Sydney Observatory after completing a degree at the University of Sydney in 1859 and by 1870 he was government astronomer. Extraordinarily active in his field, he photographed astronomical events, designed instruments for the Observatory, increased the number of weather stations and observers, and developed an international network of scientific contacts. From early 1877 he released a daily weather map; this may or may not have been the cause of an assassination attempt on him that year. A pioneer of limnology (the study of inland waters) and a keen natural historian, Russell remeasured existing calculations and found 500 new double stars; published numerous texts; helped establish technical education in New South Wales; and was the first University of Sydney graduate to be elected to the Royal Society. He also served as the universityâ€™s vice chancellor. His daughter, Jane Foss Russell (1863â€“1937) (right), was the second woman to gain a masterâ€™s degree from the University of Sydney, the only woman on its teaching staff in the 1890s, and a founder of the Womenâ€™s College.",

At that time, there was widespread suspicion that German firms were buying wool under cover of Japanese trading names, and one of Sawadaâ€™s early responsibilities was to reassure wool brokers that the Japanese market was above-board. Okura and Co built up extensive interests in Australian wool, barley, wheat, flour, hides and pelts in the interwar years, when Japan was one of Australiaâ€™s key trade partners; there were sixty or more trading companies in Sydney before World War II, with Japan, China and India purchasing 21% of Australia and New Zealandâ€™s clip in 1934-1935. Having settled in Mosman soon after his arrival, in 1920 Sawada moved into a guest house owned by the family of Nelson Illingworth, a prominent Sydney sculptor, who made the statuette of Henry Parkes in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. In 1924 he married Illingworthâ€™s daughter, Thelma; the couple adopted a local urchin, Ron Wylie, in the 1930s. Conspicuous on the Sydney social circuit, Shigeo and Thelma Sawada lived in a house called Hakone in Mosman until Shigeoâ€™s death in 1940, by which time he had been Managing Director of Okura Co for three years. Shigeoâ€™s brother, Renzo Sawada, was Japanese ambassador to France, and later Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Permanent Observer of Japan to the UN; Renzo presented the Peace Bell that stands at UN headquarters in New York. Shigeo Sawadaâ€™s ashes are divided between Japan and Mosman.",

Kidman ran away from his Adelaide home as a boy and worked as a cattleman, rouseabout and stockman and bullocky before establishing a butcherâ€™s shop in Cobar in the 1870s. This venture was successful enough for him to set up as a large squatter. In 1886 he bought his first station, in the Northern Territory; over the following twelve years he built up two giant chains of properties stretching across Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory. By the First World War he held land almost equal in area to that of Victoria. Arthur Triggs (1868â€“1936), pastoralist and collector, is sometimes referred to as the â€˜Kidman of the wool industryâ€™. Triggs came to Australia aged 19 and worked as an accountant in Yass before buying his first 8 000 wethers. From 1897 on he bought and leased properties studded along lines from Bourke to Kiandra, establishing a pattern of running between 250 000 and 500 000 sheep and some cattle at any one time. Triggs travelled often to London, where he indulged his passion for old books, manuscripts, coins and pictures, while his second wife, Mary, bought up specimens of antique lace. It became a truism that when Triggs prospered, so did Yass. After he died, a distinctive gateway, funded by public subscription, was erected in his honour in the townâ€™s Victoria Park.",

Yes, he is a great old skite. I am glad you got them off, but I wish youâ€™d been able to send them by Pat Kennedy or someone who could handle them well, as the road is in a deplorable state from Birdsville to Hergett.\\n\\nI got quite a shock to see you say there are 15000 cattle â€“ I thought there were about 9000.\\n\\nI note what you say about going away at the end of the year. You are quite welcome to this leave. Iâ€™m very sorry indeed to hear you have anything the matter with you, because I must say youâ€™ve been more than satisfactory and the place has been managed cheaply, and well, by you, and Iâ€™m obliged for what you have done, and I will arrange to give you a bonus. At any rate, at the end of the year I will give you 100 pounds, and pay your wages for three months until we know if youâ€™ll be able to come back again. I would like to be fair to a man who has served me well. I hope youâ€™ll be able to come back for a year or two, or perhaps I could give you a place more inside somewhere.\\n\\nI am pleased to have word from you and to see all you say. Thereâ€™s been some mistake, partly through my fault, and Monkira is under offer. I expect people will be coming out there to look at it but do not give them too good an account of the place as I do not want to sell it. Tell them that there are 750 bullocks there that are sold but have not been moved because of the bad season and if necessary, you can give a few of them a shoot down on the Bluff. I am leaving it in your hands to do what you think best, but you will understand that I do not want to sell and I hope they will turn it down.\\n\\nCan you let me know something about the horses?",

The team was led by Wollongong-born David Gregory (1845â€“1919), who had captained a combined New South Wales and Victoria team in its defeat of a touring English side in March 1877. Afterwards, in partnership with a Victorian named John Conway (1842â€“1909), Gregory put together a side to play a series of matches in England. Recruited were New South Welshmen Frederick Spofforth (1853â€“1926), William (Billy) Murdoch (1854â€“1911), Thomas Garrett (1858â€“1943), Charles Bannerman (1851â€“1930) and his brother Alec (1854â€“1924); Victorians Francis (Frank) Allan (1849â€“1917), Thomas Horan (1854â€“1916), John McCarthy (Jack) Blackham (1854â€“1932) and Henry Boyle (1847â€“1907); and a Tasmanian, George Bailey (1853â€“1926). Another player, Billy Midwinter (1851â€“1890), joined the team in England but defected halfway through the tour to play for Gloucestershire. The players and their two managers (Conway and William Gibbes) contributed Â£50 each to finance the tour, playing a number of warm-up matches against local teams before leaving for England in March 1878. They defeated a Marylebone Cricket Club eleven (captained by WG Grace) by nine wickets at Lordâ€™s in May 1878, bowling them out for 33 and 19, with Australian fast bowler Spofforth â€“ aka â€˜The Demonâ€™ â€“ taking six wickets for four runs in the first innings and four for sixteen in the second. Then, between June and September, the team played games against Middlesex, Surrey and Gloucestershire (Spofforth again being the main destroyer); and en route home stopped in America for fixtures in Philadelphia and San Francisco. A crowd of 20,000 people is said to have welcomed them back to Sydney at the conclusion of the tour, which had proved an enormous financial as well as sporting success. Spofforth, Murdoch, Horan, Garrett, Blackham and Alec Bannerman all featured in the Australian outfit whose defeat of England at The Oval in August 1882 initiated â€˜The Ashesâ€™ test series â€“ which remains international cricketâ€™s most storied rivalry.\\n\\nPhotographers Andrew and George Taylor opened their first studio in east London in 1866 and by the early 1880s had expanded their operations throughout the city and to branches in many regional areas. Like many studios of the period, A & G Taylor specialised in cartes de visite, the format typically employed for souvenir-style portraits of notables and celebrities. In the back row, left to right, are: John Conway, George Bailey, William Gibbes, and Frank Allan; seated in the middle row, left to right, are: Jack Blackham, Billy Murdoch, Tom Horan, David Gregory, Alec Bannerman and Fred Spofforth; and seated at the front, left to right, are Tom Garrett, Charles Bannerman and Henry Boyle.",

Born in Victoria, he competed in Australia and London, winning an incredible 101 walking matches by age ten. The activity of competitive walking, or 'Pedestrianism' as it was known, attracted large crowds at its peak in the mid-nineteenth century. The sport's early history dates back to 1600 when the English aristocracy would send their footmen ahead of their carriages to deliver messages. To the amusement of the nobility, the footmen were often pitched against one another in races upon which large sums of money were wagered. By 1800, competitive long-distance walking had emerged as a popular sport and by mid-century it had become glamorised as a lucrative international sport. In late 1863 the Argus reported that 'Martin, of Bendigo, a pedestrian of some note, has challenged John Day, of Ballarat, a lad eight years of age, to walk him a distance of 800 yards for Â£5 a side'. In 1865 the 'Kentish Dwarf' and Master Johnny Day had a trial of speed on the Ballarat Cricket Ground. In 1867 Day was said to have walked 300 times around 'the circle' at the New Royal Victoria Theatre in Sydney in an attempt to cover five miles in less than 50 minutes. Towards the end of the 1860s, Day turned from pedestrianism to equestrianism and his name began appearing in the columns of horseracing pundits. In 1870, at fourteen years of age, Day jockeyed the bay gelding Nimblefoot to victory in the Melbourne Cup in what was one of the most controversial finishes in Cup history. Young jockey Day got the last 'ounce of his mount', pipping the British thoroughbred Lapdog at the post and withal recording the quickest race time in the first ten years of the Melbourne Cup with three minutes, 37 seconds. By the turn of the century pedestrianism had been largely superseded by competitive cycling. Johnny Day didn't live long enough to witness it, being only 28 when he died of Addison's disease in June 1885.",

She won two more gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in Canada in 1994. The first Aboriginal track and field athlete to represent Australia at the Olympic Games, she won a silver medal in Atlanta in 1996. She was ranked first in the world in her signature event, the 400m, in which she won back-to-back World Championships in 1997 and 1999, and, memorably, the Olympic gold medal in front of her home crowd in Sydney in 2000. The Catherine (now Cathy) Freeman Foundation was established in 2007 to enhance educational opportunities for Aboriginal children.\\n\\nThis photograph was taken at the NSW Academy of Sport in December 1994.

Coloured in tones ranging from sepia to velvety black, her face is closely cropped to exclude her hair and much of her forehead.\\n\\nHer strong, black, gently arched brows span the width of the image and a water droplet rests in the slight crease between them. Deeply set almond shaped eyes gaze directly forward with intense focus that commands attention. There are dark shadows in the inner corners of her eyes that extend underneath them and a short way down her nose. Cathyâ€™s nose is narrow at the bridge but broadens towards the tip and another water droplet pools at the side of her left nostril.  \\nLight shines on her left cheek making it lighter than her right. Her cheeks are slightly lifted. On the right side, the area between her nose and upper lip is in shadow.  \\nHer full lips are framed by subtle creases on either side. She holds her mouth closed, a droplet gleams and drips from under her rounded chin, suspended in an extended tear shape. Behind it, a narrow band of her neck is visible, the rest disappearing into deep black. \\n\\n**Audio description written by Krysia Kitch and voiced by Emma Bedford**",

Born in Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island), she became Queensland State Secretary of the Federal Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advancement in 1961, and campaigned successfully for amendments to Sections 51(xxvi) and 127 of the Constitution in 1967. Throughout her life, she aimed to promote cultural pride among Aboriginal people through her writing, which she described as 'sloganistic, civil rightish, plain and simple'. Her first book of poetry, _We are Going_, was published in 1964. Noonuccal returned to Minjerribah in 1971 where she taught Aboriginal culture to thousands of school children, and published two children's books. Having gained world acclaim for her writing and advocacy (for which she was also conferred with four honorary doctorates), she published her last collection of poems, _Kath Walker in China_, in 1988. That year, she reassumed her tribal name in protest at the Bicentennial celebrations, and returned the MBE she had been awarded in 1970.\\n\\nAlthough Noonuccal had a reputation for fierceness, George Fetting invited her to be included in his exhibition of prominent Australian women, and found her very welcoming. He photographed her at her modest home on Minjerribah; this singular and searching image is the lasting legacy of his visit.",

There was a deputation from all over Australia of Aboriginal spokesmen and women and we did go in. Sir Robert Menzies had told the public and the politicians, the people of the House, that he would not have a referendum in his lifetime as prime minister. Heâ€™d been badly beaten on the referendum before where he had appealed to the people to outlaw Communism and when the people said â€˜No outlawing of the Communist Partyâ€™, Sir Robert Menzies refused then to have anything to do with referendums in his lifetime as prime minister.\\n\\nWe lobbied the House of Parliament and itâ€™s to their discredit, really, that when we asked them to bring out the laws concerning the Aboriginal people that there was no laws, no books on the Aboriginal people in their archives or libraries, and they had to quickly have them printed, so that the politicians could read what it was, for and against the Aborigines. There was one, however, on the national â€“ the Canberra law book saying that if Aboriginals go into Canberra, any Justice of the Peace could declare them illegal immigrants into Canberra and they could be chased out of Canberra. This still applied to us, incidentally, at this period of time. And we always made a joke of it when we went to Canberra, you know, â€˜If you get into trouble, you know the law on the book. If a JP says Get Out, make sure you get your blanket,â€™ because the law still said that before sending them out of Canberra, they must first issue them with one government blanket. So we were determined weâ€™d get our government blanket if ever they threw us out.  \\nWe told everyone this and we made it a laughingstock â€“ Canberra a laughingstock â€“ to such an extent that the first thing Sir Robert Menzies did was delete that off the Canberra constitution. So itâ€™s no longer there.",

Itâ€™s easy to put a mark on a ballot paper, and I must say this definitely, that there was a small minority group of sincere Australian people but I would say 75 [per cent] of those who voted Yes did it to clear their guilty conscience.\\n\\nIncidentally, itâ€™s interesting to understand why those terrible discriminative laws were put into the books. In the first place, our civic fathers, or the white manâ€™s civic fathers of long ago, during the â€˜soothing of the dying pillowâ€™ era, the politicians, or the statesmen of that time, were writing over to Queen Victoria saying, â€˜The Aborigine is dying out.â€™ And true, he was â€“ they were poisoning him with strychnine in the waterholes and they were shooting him, and they were doing all sorts of things. And the Aborigine dropped from 300,000 strong to 80,000 in a very short period of time. So it was quite natural for them to say the Aborigine was a dying race.\\n\\nNow it was during this period of time that the Constitution was being fixed, and as they thought we were a dying race, to save themselves a lot of bother they said, â€˜Well we will not count the Aborigines and we do not have to make laws for the Aborigines, because theyâ€™re going to die out anywayâ€™. And this is the reason today why Aboriginals have not had any education, any decent housing, any facilities that the white Australian enjoys today. Itâ€™s because of that stupid business of thinking the Aboriginals were going to die out.\\n\\nMind you, the Aboriginals are a determined lot, and theyâ€™re quite ungrateful. They didnâ€™t die, they lived on and are still living on; in spite of the many attempts to commit genocide and assassinate us all, we are still here. I think weâ€™ll last the white man out, truly.",

Chin resting on thumb and fingers pointing up towards her eyes and placed along her cheek bone. Her face is slightly to the right of centre. Soft light illuminates the right side of her face with the extreme left of her forehead, nose, and hand cast into shadow. The sepia tones of her skin stand out against a black background.\\n\\nOodgerooâ€™s face is cropped across her high wrinkled forehead, and short silvered hair is glimpsed on either side. Between her brows is a single deep vertical furrow. She has large dark eyes with bags beneath them. She gazes to her left at the camera. Her nose is straight and deep creases run from each side of her nose to her closed lips and then continue downward to the edge of her face. A faint line shows the edges of a dark shirt that disappears into the background. \\n\\nThe elements of a slightly raised left eyebrow, her liquid eyes, the pores of her skin and the whirls and cracks of her fingerprints create a detailed textural portrait of this Quandamooka woman.\\n\\n**Audio description script written by Krysia Kitch and voiced by Kate Matthews**",

Henson says of the portrait: 'I was interested in the way great music affects us. The sheer force of such beauty causes us to fall in love. It is that love that I wanted to see transform the subjectâ€™s appearance. But strangely, to suggest any of this, one must step back â€¦ Only across such a distance might one describe such intimacy and such longing.' Young herself has compared the portrait's structure to the three acts of an opera.",

And so, by photographing her in the pit with an orchestra rehearsing, I just thought this [is] just never going to look as interesting as in its own right. So the picture becomes the subject rather than, you know, the event thatâ€™s being documented being the subject. This is one of those great conundrums for photographers. I organised for Simone to visit me in my studio. We had a conversation, I said â€˜Well look, what are you working on at the moment?â€™ She was preparing to conduct the _Rosenkavalier,_ the Richard Strauss. And I said, â€˜Oh well, you know, why donâ€™t we put it on and why donâ€™t you conduct to the music?â€™ I said, â€˜You know, itâ€™s strange, of course.â€™ And she said, â€˜Itâ€™s very strange, because I lead, whereas if I listen to a recording and try to conduct, Iâ€™m following the recording.â€™ And I said, â€˜Well it might be interesting for you, letâ€™s give it a go.â€™ And she said, â€˜Well, you know, the only recording that I really have been listening to carefully is by Erich Kleiber, and, you know, youâ€™re not going to have that.â€™ And I go, â€˜Well here it is.â€™\\n\\nShe got into it, and she started conducting and I was just taking pictures and we kept going and we kept going and we both got quite a good sweat up. In fact in the end we â€“ she conducted the whole opera. Like, we were having a lot of fun. She was like, going off and I just kept shooting it and shooting it and shooting it and at the end of it like a normal session that I would do with one of my models, it was like both people are kind of exhausted and perspiring. And she packed up and caught a cab and I went back to the lab and started working on the pictures.\\n\\nYou know, there are lots of things that are interesting and theyâ€™re technically fine but youâ€™re looking for that sort of special thing in a shoot, and so over the process of weeks, or months or years in some cases you narrow it down to those few images that you think are essential or that capture something, that are somehow compelling. And yeah, [I] narrowed it down to three. I couldnâ€™t get it down to one. Thatâ€™s how the process worked.",

Spending his primary school years in Canberra, Deane was educated in Catholic schools and the University of Sydney. He returned to the ACT to work in the Attorney-Generalâ€™s Department before undertaking postgraduate study in international law in The Hague. Called to the Bar in 1957, he lectured for five years at Sydney University before being appointed Kingâ€™s Counsel in 1966 (at the time named Queen's Counsel). Eleven years later he was appointed a judge in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, a judge of the Federal Court of Australia and the President of the Australian Trade Practices Tribunal. In July 1982, he was appointed a Justice of the High Court of Australia, on which he served until he retired in late 1995 to take up his appointment as Governor-General. Sworn in by Paul Keating and farewelled by John Howard, Deane is popularly renowned as a champion of the common person, and Indigenous Australians in particular. â€˜The ultimate test of our worth as a nation will be how we treat our most vulnerableâ€™, he said on his last day in office, when he hosted a lunch for homeless children at Government House and expressed regret that Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians had not yet formally reconciled. Deane stayed in Canberra after retirement and is now Patron of the Canberra Centenary celebrations.",

With his brother, John, he emigrated to Van Diemenâ€™s Land in 1822. They took up a 1400 acre land grant before establishing a business with their younger brothers, James and Daniel, on Elizabeth Street, Hobart, in 1832. In September 1834, he married Margaret Whyte (1811â€“1866), the daughter of free settlers George and Jessie Whyte, who had emigrated from Scotland in 1832. The first of William and Margaretâ€™s seven children â€“ three daughters and four sons â€“ was born in 1835. By this time, Robertson had amassed sufficient capital to join a number of other investors in a scheme to expand pastoral activities to the Port Phillip district. These investors â€“ known as the Port Phillip Association â€“ helped finance John Batmanâ€™s explorations of Port Phillip in 1835, during the course of which Batman made a so-called â€˜treatyâ€™ with the local Aboriginal people that became the basis for his land claim. Robertson travelled to Port Phillip in 1836 and 1837, selecting land near present-day Sunbury and, later, Colac. By the late 1840s, he was a major landholder, his properties stocked with â€˜the best bulls and cows that could be got in the coloniesâ€™. Robertson oversaw the operation of his pastoral empire from his home in Hobart until retiring from his business in 1852. He settled permanently at his Colac property, The Hill, in the 1860s, and was described on his death in 1874 as â€˜a founder of Victoriaâ€™s fortunesâ€™.\\n\\nWilliam Robertson was a significant patron of local artists.",

The golden circle represents the power and resilience of the woman.
